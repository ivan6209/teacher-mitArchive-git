00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,410
Hi.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,980
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,150
We've been talking about a bunch
of different integration

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:11,820
techniques.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,690
Here are a couple of examples on
which you can try and pick

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,090
out the right technique
to compute these

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,840
two integrals with.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,905
So I've got the first one, is
the indefinite integral of x

10
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:24,640
cubed times the square root
of the quantity x

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,880
squared plus 2 dx.

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,640
And the second one is
a definite integral.

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,190
It's the integral 1 to e of x
squared times the quantity ln

14
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,180
of x squared with
respect to x.

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,290
So why don't you pause the
video, take some time to

16
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,395
compute these two integrals,
come back, and we can compute

17
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:41,645
them together.

18
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:48,540

19
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,100
So hopefully you had some luck
working on these integrals.

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,140
Let's start with
the first one.

21
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,930
So for question A, let me
just rewrite it here.

22
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,870
We have the integral of x cubed
times the square root of

23
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,250
x squared plus 2 dx.

24
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,010
Now, if you look at this
integral, what you see is a

25
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,250
product of two terms. This
term is x cubed.

26
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,110
It's a nice term.

27
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,820
This one is the square root
of x squared plus 2.

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,930
That's not such a nice term.

29
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,370
There are a few different
things you might

30
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,970
think to try here.

31
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,070
So one thing you might think to
try, is this square root of

32
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,330
x squared plus 2 is the sort of
thing that shows up in trig

33
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,300
substitutions.

34
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,340
So that's one thing you might
have in your mind.

35
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,520
Another thing you might have in
your mind, is that this is

36
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,160
a product of two things.

37
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,000
So you might consider the
possibility that you're going

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,070
to do an integration
by parts here.

39
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,848
And the third thing you might
have in your mind, is just,

40
00:01:41,848 --> 00:01:44,870
you could just, you know,
this might just be a

41
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,070
substitution situation.

42
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,640
You have this x squared plus 2
as the sort of discrete entity

43
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,560
that shows up there.

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,900
So you might try a regular
substitution.

45
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,960
Now you have to, you know, make
a choice among which of

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,810
these to try.

47
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,530
And it seems to me that of
those options, a regular

48
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,420
substitution is the
easiest to do.

49
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,405
And you'll find out really
quickly whether you've made

50
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:09,220
your life horribly complicated
or not.

51
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,950
And frequently, with integration
by parts, if you

52
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,050
have the option of doing a
substitution when you have

53
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,750
integration by parts, you know,
it won't, if do the

54
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,190
substitution, you still can do

55
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,410
integration by parts afterward.

56
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,800
If you do integration by parts
first, you can still do the

57
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,490
substitution afterward.

58
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,700
So trying the substitution
shouldn't hurt us for

59
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,030
integration by parts, and a
regular substitution will be a

60
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,540
lot simpler than a trig
substitution here, right?

61
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,922
Trig substitutions in general
are complicated, so it's a

62
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,150
good idea to see if there's
something simpler that can be

63
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,190
done first.

64
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,230
So if we're going to try regular
substitution, the sort

65
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:48,230
of natural thing to do, is to
set u equal x squared plus 2.

66
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:55,302
So in this case, we have
du is equal to 2x dx.

67
00:02:55,302 --> 00:02:58,210

68
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,010
Or--

69
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,730
well, so OK.

70
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,720
So we want to substitute
these things in.

71
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,600
The u is going to go into
the square root term.

72
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,070
So that's going to
be taken care of.

73
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,910
And the dx part-- well, we've
got an x here to pair up with

74
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,890
the dx, so that's going
to give us a du.

75
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,800
And then we'll have x
squared left over.

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,960
So we'll need to substitute
in for x squared.

77
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,910
So we're going to use x squared
is equal to u minus 2,

78
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:31,340
and x dx is equal
to du over 2.

79
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,150
So when we make these
substitutions in here, what we

80
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,020
get it is that this integral is
equal to the integral of--

81
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,170
so it's x squared times the
square root of x squared plus

82
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,820
2 times x dx.

83
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,050
So that's u minus 2 times
the square root of u

84
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,420
times du over 2.

85
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,450
Now, having made the
substitution, we see--

86
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:54,750
OK.

87
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,840
So with a little bit of
rearrangement, this is just a

88
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,420
sum of powers of u.

89
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:58,610
Right?

90
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:05,460
We can rewrite this as the
integral of u to the 3/2 over

91
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:11,580
2 minus u to the 1/2 du.

92
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,310
And now, this is just
straightforward to integrate.

93
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,090
So it turn out we don't need
integration by parts.

94
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,630
We don't need a trig
substitution.

95
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,730
Just this regular substitution
works nicely.

96
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,810
So we get, well, u to the
3/2, so we compute an

97
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,190
antiderivative, so that
gives us u to the 5/2.

98
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,540
And I have to divide by 5/2, so
I have to multiply by 2/5.

99
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,510
And then I have a half.

100
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,050
So it's u to the 5/2
over 5, minus--

101
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:44,950
so u to the 1/2, so that gives
me 3/2, so I need minus 2/3 u

102
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,010
to the 3/2.

103
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,460
OK.

104
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,020
And now to finish this off,
I have to do my final back

105
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,890
substitution, and replace
u with x.

106
00:04:53,890 --> 00:05:01,985
So this is going to be x squared
plus 2 over 5 to the

107
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:10,750
5/2 minus 2/3 times x squared
plus 2 to the 3/2.

108
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,060
All right.

109
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,160
Plus a constant.

110
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,780
Thank you, peanut gallery.

111
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,460
Plus a constant.

112
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,260
Right.

113
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,540
Indefinite integral, should
have had it right the very

114
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,180
first time I went through.

115
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,790
Plus a constant, both times.

116
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,160
OK.

117
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,530
Good.

118
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,220
So that's all there is for
part A. Now let's look

119
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,770
at part B. So OK.

120
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,680
So part B is a little more
complicated-looking.

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,880
Let me copy it over
here again.

122
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,680
So part B, we have the integral
from 1 to e of x

123
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,950
squared times the quantity
ln x squared dx.

124
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,920
So again, there are a couple of
possibilities for what we

125
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,680
could want to do here.

126
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,090
One thing is you could try just
a regular substitution.

127
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,130
So maybe a regular substitution
you might want to

128
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:04,760
try is u equals ln of x,
or x equals e to the u.

129
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,130
And now if you try that, you
can try it, and what you'll

130
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,500
see, is you'll get something.

131
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,660
So here we have a polynomial
times a function of the

132
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,110
logarithm, a power
of the logarithm.

133
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,430
If you try that substitution,
what you'll end up with is a

134
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,790
polynomial in u times
an exponential in u.

135
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:21,960
So OK.

136
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,640
So it's not clear that we've won
anything, if we make that

137
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,080
substitution.

138
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,550
The other thing we can try, is
we can try integration by

139
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,990
parts here.

140
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,990
Again, we have a product form.

141
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,920
And if you make that
substitution, you get

142
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,400
polynomial times exponential,
and that's also a promising

143
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,620
place for integration by parts,
after the substitution.

144
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,240
So OK.

145
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,740
So I'm not going to make
the substitution.

146
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,080
I'm just going to go, seeing
this product, I'm going to go

147
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,690
for integration by
parts directly.

148
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,540
So I need to decide what
pieces are which for

149
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,580
integration by parts.

150
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,290
And the thing to remember is
this that-- so I have here a

151
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,940
polynomial times a function
of the logarithm.

152
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,940
And the thing to remember is
that polynomials like to be

153
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,920
differentiated.

154
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,850
That's their preference.

155
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,130
But logarithms really, really
like to be differentiated.

156
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,180
You'd much rather differentiate
a logarithm than

157
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,700
integrate it.

158
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,130
You can integrate
a polynomial--

159
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,473
I mean you can integrate
either of them.

160
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:13,090
You can integrate
a polynomial.

161
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,300
When you integrate a polynomial,
you get something

162
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,030
that's still a fairly
nice polynomial.

163
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,070
Integrating logarithms
is harder, whereas

164
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,000
differentiating logarithms
makes them into

165
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,610
just powers of x.

166
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,620
So setting this up as an
integration by parts, we're

167
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,890
going to want to take this,
the everything with the

168
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,370
logarithm in it, and that's
the piece we want to

169
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,270
differentiate, to try
and simplify it.

170
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,340
So that's going to
be our u part.

171
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:44,880
So we're going to try u equals
ln x squared, and that leaves

172
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,450
v prime to be x squared.

173
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,810
So to do integration by parts--

174
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:50,980
OK.

175
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,880
We need to differentiate and
we need to integrate.

176
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,180
So if I differentiate ln x
squared, I get u prime.

177
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,060
The prime is equal to--

178
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,260
OK.

179
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,560
Well, this is a little
chain rule.

180
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,600
So it's 2 ln x times the
derivative of ln x,

181
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,120
which is 1 over x.

182
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,470
And if I integrate v prime,
I get v is equal to

183
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,120
x cubed over 3.

184
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,400
OK.

185
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,370
So now I use the formula for
integration by parts.

186
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,520
So I have that this integral--

187
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,590
what I'm going to do is I'm
going to call this, let me

188
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,890
give it a name, i.

189
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,180
Now I'm going to come down here
and I'm going to say, i

190
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,230
is equal to--

191
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,720
well, by integration by parts,
it's equal to uv minus the

192
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,350
integral of u prime v dx.

193
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:47,910
So in our case, uv is x cubed
over 3 times ln x squared.

194
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,350
But the thing to remember is,
this was a definite integral

195
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,050
to start out with.

196
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,050
It's from 1 to e.

197
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,880
So when you take this part out
front, you have to take the

198
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,440
difference of its two values.

199
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,030
So we're going to evaluate this
between x equals 1 and x

200
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,010
equals e, minus the definite
integral--

201
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,780
so we still have a definite
integral from one to e of u

202
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,450
prime v. So that's 2/3--

203
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:13,740
OK.

204
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,730
So now we have an ln x
over x times x cubed.

205
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,610
So the x and the x cubed, that
cancels 1 power of x out of

206
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,030
the numerator.

207
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:30,930
So we're left with 2/3
x squared ln x dx.

208
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,840
So.

209
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,820
One thing we see-- this is
just be, this is going to

210
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,790
evaluate to a constant.

211
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,570
We're going to plug in e e, and
we're going to plug in 1,

212
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,500
and we're going to take
the difference.

213
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
So that's just some number.

214
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,560
This part is still
some integral.

215
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,450
Are we done yet?

216
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,070
Well, it's not obvious
immediately how

217
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,890
to integrate this.

218
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,400
I mean, I don't already know
off the top of my head what

219
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,340
the antiderivative here is.

220
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,410
On the other hand, it's
definitely simpler than what

221
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,240
we started with, right?

222
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,630
Before we had x squared
ln x squared.

223
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,270
Here we just have
x squared ln x.

224
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,840
So we've simplified
the integrand.

225
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,800
And it's still in a form in
which we can further integrate

226
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,740
by parts, if you wanted to.

227
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,050
Right?

228
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,160
So now in this case the natural
thing to do would be

229
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,740
very similar to what
we did before.

230
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,670
We're going to take the u to be
the ln x, to be the piece

231
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,110
we differentiate, and
we're going to take

232
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,355
the v to be x squared.

233
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:21,420
OK?

234
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,110
So we can do that.

235
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,030
So this is equal to--

236
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,310
let's see.

237
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,590
I'm going to bring it,
now, upstairs.

238
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,930
So this is equal
to-- all right.

239
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,600
So we plug in e here.

240
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,530
We get e cubed over 3 times
1, minus when we plug in

241
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,770
1, ln of 1 is 0.

242
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,950
So that just gives me
e cubed over 3 for

243
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,970
the first part minus--

244
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,470
all right, and I'm going to
pull the 2/3 out front.

245
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,900
So it's minus 2/3 times--

246
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,150
OK.

247
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,200
So now I'm going to do
an integration by

248
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,850
parts on this one.

249
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,920
So again, like I said,
I'm going to take u

250
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,860
is equal to ln x.

251
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,690
I'm going to take v prime
is equal to x squared.

252
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:10,420
So that means u prime is equal
to 1 over x and v is equal to

253
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,190
x cubed over 3.

254
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:20,690
And so again, I get uv, which
is x cubed over 3 ln x, and

255
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,830
again, because it was a definite
integral, I have to

256
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:28,630
evaluate this between x equals
1 and e, minus--

257
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,930
OK.

258
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,150
So minus the integral of u
prime v. So this is the

259
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,870
integral from 1 to e. u prime
v is 1 over x times x cubed

260
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:43,070
over 3, so that's x
squared over 3 dx.

261
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,790
OK, so having written all that
down, what you see is this is

262
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,730
a constant minus 2/3.

263
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:47,940
OK.

264
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,860
This is just some constant.

265
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,250
We'll plug in e, we'll
plug in 1.

266
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:50,920
That's easy.

267
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,330
And now we have an integral,
and we've

268
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,500
reduced this finally.

269
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,800
Here we have just an integral
of a polynomial.

270
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,420
So an integral of a polynomial,
that's easy to

271
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,900
compute, you can
do it yourself.

272
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,490
And I'm going to let you finish
off the last couple of

273
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,820
steps for yourself.

274
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:12,380
In the end, the answer should
work out to 5 e cubed over 27

275
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:19,900
minus 2 over 27.

276
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,520
This is what you should find
the final answer to be when

277
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,580
you work it all out.

278
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,420
So I'll end there.
