Second  EVENING  EXAM 
Wednesday,  April  21,  7:30  PM  –  9:30  PM

2 ×  11��  sheets  of  notes  (both  sides)  are  allowed. 
This  is  a  closed  book  exam,  but  three  8 1

or  two  sides  of  each,  but  only  three  sheets  are  allowed. 
•	 Everything  on  the  notes  must  be  in  your  original  handwriting  (i.e.,  material  cannot  be 
xeroxed  from  solutions,  tables,  books,  etc).

• 
You  have  two  hours  for  this  exam.

• 
Calculators  are  NOT  allowed. 
•	 We  will  NOT  provide  a  table  of  transforms. 
•	 There  are  4  problems  on  the  exam  with  the  percentage  for  each  part  and  the  total  per­
centage  for  each  problem  as  indicated.  Note  that  the  problems  do  not  all  have  the  same 
total  percentage. 
•	 The  problems  are  not  in  order  of  diﬃculty.  We  recommend  that  you  read  through  all  the 
problems,  then  do  the  problems  in  whatever  order  suits  you  best. 
•	 Please  be  neat—we  cannot  grade  what  we  cannot  decipher. 
•	 We  tried  to  provide  ample  space  for  you  to  write  in.  However,  the  amount  of  space 
provided  is  not  an  indication  of  the  length  of  the  explanation  required.  Short,  to  the 
point  explanations  are  preferred  to  long  ones  that  show  little  understanding. 

All  work  and  answers  must  be  in  the  space  provided  on  the  exam  booklet.  You  are  welcome 
to  use  scratch  pages  that  we  provide  but  when  you  hand  in  the  exam  we  will  not  accept  any 
pages  other  than  the  exam  booklet.  There  will  be  absolutely  no  exceptions. 

Exam  Grading 

In  grading  all  of  the  6.011  exams  we  will  be  focusing  on  your  level  of  understanding  of  the 
material  associated  with  each  problem.  When  we  grade  each  part  of  a  problem  we  will  do  our 
best  to  assess,  from  your work,  your  level  of  understanding.  On  each  part  of  an  exam  question 
we will  also  indicate  the  percentage  of  the  total  exam  grade  represented by  that part,  and  your 
numerical  score  on  the  exam  will  then  be  calculated  accordingly. 
Our  assessment  of  your  level  of  understanding  will  be  based  upon  what  is  given  in  your 
solution.  A  correct  ﬁnal  answer  with  no  explanation  will  not  receive  full  credit,  and  may  even 
receive no  credit at all.  An  incorrect ﬁnal answer having a  solution and  explanation  that  shows 
excellent  understanding  quite  likely  will  receive  full  (or  close  to  full)  credit.

By  choosing  c1  + 5c2  = 0,  the  mode  corresponding  to  λ1  becomes  unobservable. 

(d)  (7%) We  assume  that  the  state  variables  are  not  directly measureable  but  both  the  input 
x(t) and  the ouput  y(t) are with  cT  = (1, 0).  We want  to  estimate  the  state of  the  system 
based  on  the  following  equations 
dˆq(t)  =  Aˆq(t) + bx(t) − l(y(t) − yˆ(t))
dt 
yˆ(t) =  cT ˆq(t) 

where  ˆq  is  the  estimate  for  q.  Can  the  gain  vector  l  be  chosen  so  that  the  error  in  the 
state  estimate  decays  asymptotically.  Clearly  explain  your  answer.

NO

There  is  no  scalar  m  such  that  cT  = 1 0 =  m  −5  1  .  Thus  the  unstable  mode  is

Problem  2  (28%)

(a)  (7%) A  given  system  is  asymptotically  unstable  but BIBO  stable.	 Is  it  possible  to  imple­
ment  observer­based  feedback  to make  the  system  asymptotically  stable? 

YES 

NO 

Explain: 

A  system  is  asymptotically  unstable  but  BIBO  stable  means  that: 

1.  Unstable  modes  are  hidden 
2.  Unstable  modes  are  unreachable  or  unobservable 
3.  Observer  based  feedback  cant  stabilize  the  system  asymptotically 

(b)  (7%)  A  reachable  and  observable  2nd  order  system  is  placed  in  series  with  a  reachable 
and  observable  3rdorder  system,  see  Figure  2­1.  The  overall  system  is  found  to  have  one 
hidden  mode.

H (z )  2nd  Order 

-

G(z )  3rd  Order

Figure  2­1: 

If  the  hidden  mode  corresponds  to  a  pole  in  the  original  2nd  order  system  (H ),  is  the 
hidden mode  of  the  overall  system  unreachable  and/or  unobservable? 

unreachable:  YES 

NO	

unobservable:  YES 

NO 

Explain:

The original second order system H(z)  is reachable and the hidden mode  is a pole of H(z).

The  hidden mode  must  be  reachable,  but  unobservable.

Consider a digital communication system  in which an i.i.d.  bit stream s[n] of ones and zeros 
is  transmitted  over  a  faulty,  memoryless  channel  with  ones  and  zeroes  equally  probable.  The 
probability  of  a  one  being  received  as  a  zero  is  1/8  and  the  probability  of  a  zero  being  received 
as  a  one  is  1/4.  This  type  of  channel  is  referred  to  as  a  binary  memoryless  channel  and  is
