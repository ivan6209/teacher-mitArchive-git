18.02 Multivariab le Ca lculus, Fa ll 2007 
Transcript – Lecture 16 

OK, let's start. So, first of all, some information. So, some information about the 
test. So, most of you did better this time than on the first exam. That's good news. 
The class median was 85. That means ha lf of you got more than 85. Ha lf of you got 
less than 85. Passing is still at 65. So, roughly speaking, again, these letters don't 
mean anything because what we do is we'll add all your scores together and see 
based on that. But, if you want to know roughly what it means, I'd say A 
corresponds to 90 or more. B corresponds to 80 or more, and C corresponds to 65 
just to give you a  rough feeling. 

Now, of course, it depends a lot on how you do on homework and things like that. 
So, if you got 78, it doesn't mean that you're a C student. It just means not much. 
Also, so if you didn't pass, then you should take the makeup. There was one makeup 
yesterday. Well, I guess it's too late for that one. There's another one today, and 
there's two more on Monday and Tuesday. Also, if you were absent for some reason, 
you couldn't make it, if you were sick on Tuesday then please take a makeup. 

OK, so  that's, I think, it for announcements. And, now we are going to get something 
new and exciting. So, basically the last few weeks, we've been doing derivatives. 
Now, we're going to integra ls. So -- OK, so more precisely, we are going to be 
talking about doub le integrals. OK, so just to motivate the notion, let me just remind 
you that when you have a function of one variab le -- -- say,  f of x, and you take its 
integrals from, say, a to b of f of x dx, well,  that corresponds to the area below the 
graph of f over the interva l from a  to b. 

OK, so  the p icture is something like you have a; you have b. You have the graph of 
f, and then what the integral measures is the area of this reg ion. And, when we say 
the area of this reg ion, of course,  if f  is positive, that's what happens. If f is 
negative, then we count negatively the area below the x axis. OK, so, now, when you 
have a function of two variab les, then you can try to do the same thing. Namely, you 
can plot its graph. Its graph will be a surface in space. And then, we can try to look 
for the volume below the graph. And that's what we w ill call the doub le integral of 
the function over a certain region. 

OK, so  let's say that we have a  function of two variab les, x and y. Then, we'll look at 
the volume that's below the graph z equals f of xy. OK, so, let's draw a picture for 
what this means. I have a function of x and y. I can draw its graph. The graph will 
be the surface w ith equation z equa ls f of x and y. And, well, I have to decide where 
I w ill integrate the function. So,  for that, I will choose some region in the xy plane. 

And, I will integrate the function on that region. So, it's over a  reg ion, R, in the xy 
plane. So, I have this region R and  I look at the piece of the graph that is above this 
region. And, we'll try to compute the volume of this solid here. OK, that's what the 
double integra l w ill measure. So, we'll ca ll that the doub le integral of our reg ion, R, 
of f of xy dA and I will have to expla in what the notation means. So, dA here stands 

for a piece of area. A stands for area. And, well, it's a doub le integral. So, that's why 
we have two integra l signs. 

And, we'll have to indicate somehow the reg ion over which we are integrating. OK, 
we'll come up with more concrete notations when we see how to actually compute 
these things. That's the basic definition. OK, so actually, how do we define it, that's 
not rea lly much of a definition yet. How do we actually define this rigorously? Well, 
remember, the integral in one variab le, you probably saw a definition where you take 
your integral from a  to b, and you cut it into little p ieces. 

And then, for each  little piece, you take the value of a function, and you multip ly by 
the w idth of a p iece. That gives you a  rectangular slice, and then you sum a ll of 
these rectangular slices together. So, here we'll do the same thing. So, well, let me 
put a picture up and explain what it does. So, we're going to cut our origin into little 
pieces, say, little rectangles or actually anything we want. 

And then, for each p iece, with the sma ll area, delta A, we'll take the area delta a 
times the va lue of a  function in there that w ill g ive us the volume of a sma ll box that 
sits under the graph. And then, we'll add a ll these boxes together. That gives us an 
estimate of a volume. And then,  to get actually the integral, the  integral will be 
defined as a limit as we subdivide into smaller and sma ller boxes, and we sum more 
and more pieces, OK? 

So, actua lly, what we do, oh, I still have a board here. So, the actual definition 
involves cutting R into sma ll pieces of area that's ca lled delta A or maybe delta Ai, 
the area of the i'th p iece. And then, OK, so maybe in the xy plane, we have our 
region, and we'll cut it may be using some grade. OK, and then we'll have each small 
piece. Each small p iece will have area delta Ai and it will be at some point, let's ca ll it 
xi, yi ... yi, xi. 

And then, we'll consider the sum over a ll the pieces of f at that point, xi, yi times the 
area of a small p iece. So, what that corresponds to in the three-dimensional picture 
is just I sum the volumes of all of these little columns that sit under the graph. OK, 
and then, so what I do is actua lly I take the limit as the size of the pieces tends to 
zero. So, I have more and more sma ller and smaller p ieces. 

And, that g ives me the double integra l. OK, so that's not a very good sentence, but 
whatever. So, OK, so that's the definition. Of course, we w ill have to see how to 
compute it. We don't actua lly compute it. When you compute an integra l in sing le 
variable ca lculus, you don't do that. You don't cut into little p ieces and sum the 
pieces together. You've learned how to integrate functions using various formulas, 
and similarly here, we'll learn how to actually compute these things w ithout doing 
that cutting into small pieces. 

OK, any questions first about the concept, or what the definition  is? Yes? Well, so 
we'll have to learn which tricks work, and how exactly. But, so what we'll do actually 
is we'll reduce the ca lculation of a doub le integral to two calculations of sing le 
integrals. And so,  for V, certa inly, all the tricks you've learned in single variab le 
calculus w ill come in handy. OK, so, yeah that's a strong suggestion that if you've 
forgotten everything about single variab le calculus, now would be a good time to 
actually brush up on integrals. The usua l integra ls, and the usual substitution tricks 
and easy trig in particular, these would be very useful. OK, so, yeah, how do we 
compute these things? 

That's what we would have to come up with. And, well, going back to what we d id 
with derivatives, to understand variations of functions and derivatives, what we d id 
was rea lly we took slices para llel to an axis or another one. So, in  fact, here,  the key 
is also the same. So, what we are going to do is instead of cutting into a lot of sma ll 
boxes like that and summing completely at random, we w ill actually somehow scan 
through our region by parallel p lanes, OK? 

So, let me put up, actually, a slightly different p icture up here. So, what I'm going to 
do is I'm going to take planes, say in this p icture, para llel to the yz plane. I'll take a 
moving plane that scans from the back to the front or from the front to the back. So, 
that means I set the value of x, and I  look at the slice, x equals x0, and then I w ill 
do that for a ll va lues of x0. So, now in each slice, well, I get what looks a lot like a 
sing le variab le  integral. OK, and that integra l w ill tell me, what is the area in this? 
Well, I guess it's supposed to be green, but it all comes as black, so, let's say the 
black shaded slice. And then, when I add all of these areas together, as the va lue of 
x changes, I w ill get the volume. OK, let me try to expla in that again. 

So, to compute this integral, what we do is actually we take slices. So, let's consider, 
let's call s of x the area of a slice, well, by a plane parallel to the yz p lane. OK, so on 
the p icture, s of x is just the area of this thing in the vertical wall. Now, if you sum 
all of these, well, why does that work? So, if you take the origin between two para llel 
slices that are very close to each other, what's the volume in these two things? 

Well, it's essentia lly s of x times the thickness of this very thin slice, and the 
thickness would be delta x0 dx if you take a limit w ith more and more slices. OK, so 
the volume will be the integra l of s of x dx from, well, what should be the range for 
x? Well, we would have to start at the very lowest va lue of x that ever happens in 
our origin, and we'd have to go all the way to the very largest va lue of x, from the 
very far back to the very far front. So, in this picture, we probab ly start over here at 
the back, and we'd end over here at the front. 

So, let me just say from the minimum, x, to the maximum x. And now, how do we 
find S of x? Well, S of x will be actua lly again an integra l. But now, it's an integra l of 
the variab le, y, because when we look at this slice, what changes from left to right is 
y. So, well let me actua lly write that down. For a given, x,  the area S of x you can 
compute as an  integral of f of x, y dy. OK, well, now x is a constant, and y will be the 
variable of integration. What's the range for y? Well, it's from the leftmost point here 
to the rightmost point here on the g iven slice. 

So, there is a big catch here. That's a very important thing to remember. What is the 
range of integration? The range of integration for y depends actua lly on x. See, if I 
take the slice that's p ictured on that diagram, then the range for y goes all the way 
from the very left to the very right. But, if I take a slice that, say, near the very 
front, then in fact, only a very small segment of  it will be in my region. 

So, the range of values for y w ill be much less. Let me actually draw a 2D p icture for 
that. So, remember, we fix x, so, sorry, so we fix a value of x. OK, and for a g iven 
value of x, what we w ill do is we'll slice our graph by this plane parallel to the yz 
plane. So, now we mention the graph is sitting above that. OK, that's the reg ion R. 
We have the region, R, and I have the graph of a function above this reg ion, R. And, 
I'm trying to find the area between this segment and the graph above it in this 
vertical plane. Well, to do that, I have to integrate from y going from here to here. 

I want the area of a p iece that sits above this red segment. And, so in particular, the 
endpoints,  the extreme va lues for y depend on x because, see, if I slice here instead, 
well, my bounds for y w ill be smaller. OK, so now, if I put the two things together, 
what I will get -- -- is actually a formula where I have to integrate -- -- over x -- --
an integral over y. OK, and so this is called an iterated integra l because we iterate 
twice the process of taking an integral. 

OK, so aga in, what's  important to realize here, I mean, I'm going to say that several 
times over the next few days but that's because it's the single most important thing 
to remember about doub le  integrals, the bounds here are just going to be numbers, 
OK, because the question I'm asking myself here is, what is the first va lue of x by 
which I might want to slice, and what is the last va lue of x? Which range of x do I 
want to look at to take my red slices? And, the answer is I would go all the way from 
here, that's my first slice, to somewhere here. 

That's my last slice. For any value in between these, I w ill have some red segment, 
and I w ill want to  integrate over that that. On the other hand here, the bounds w ill 
depend on the outer variab le, x, because at a fixed value of x, what the va lues of y 
will be depends on x in genera l. OK, so I think we should do  lots of examp les to 
convince ourselves and see how it works. Yeah,  it's ca lled an iterated integral 
because first we integrated over y, and then we  integrate again over x, OK? So, we 
can do that, well, I mean, y depends on x or x depends, no, actua lly x and y vary 
independently of each other inside here. What is more comp licated is how the 
bounds on y depend on x. 

But actually, you could a lso do  the other way around: first integrate over x, and then 
over y, and then the bounds for x w ill depend on y. We'll see that on an examp le. 
Yes? So,  for y, I'm using the range of va lues for y that corresponds to the given 
value of x, OK? Remember, this is just like a p lot in the xy plane. Above that, we 
have the graph. Maybe I should draw a picture here instead. For a g iven value of x, 
so that's a given slice, I have a range of values for y, that is,  from this p icture at the 
leftmost point on that slice to the rightmost point on that slice. So, where start and 
where I stop depends on the va lue of x. Does that make sense? OK. 

OK, no more questions? OK, so let's do our first example. So, let's say that we want 
to integrate the function 1-x^2-y^2 over the region defined by x between 0 and 1, 
and y between 0 and 1. So, what does that mean geometrically? Well, z = 1-x^2-
y^2, and it's a variation on, actua lly I think we plotted that one, right? That was our 
first example of a function of two variables possibly. And, so, we saw that the graph 
is this paraboloid pointing downwards. OK, it's what you get by taking a parabola 
and rotating it. 

And now, what we are asking is, what is the volume between the paraboloid and the 
xy plane over the square of side one  in the xy plane over the square of side one in 
the xy p lane, x and y between zero and one. OK, so, what we'll do is we'll, so, see, 
here I try to represent the square. And, we'll just sum the areas of the slices as, say, 
x varies from zero to one. And here, of course, setting up the bounds will be easy 
because no matter what x I take, y still goes from zero to one. See,  it's easiest to do 
double integra ls what the reg ion  is just a  rectangle on the xy p lane because then you 
don't have to worry too much about what are the ranges. OK, so let's do  it. Well, 
that would be the integra l from zero to one of the integra l from zero to one of 1-
x^2-y^2 dy dx. 

So, I'm dropp ing the parentheses. But, if you still want to see them, I'm going to put 
that in very thin so that you see what it means. But, actually, the convention is we 
won't put this parentheses in there anymore. OK, so what this means is first I w ill 
integrate 1-x^2-y^2 over y, ranging from zero to one w ith x held fixed. So, what 
that represents is the area in this slice. So, see here, I've drawn, well, what happens 
is actua lly the function takes positive and negative values. So, in  fact, I will be 
counting positively this part of the area. And, I will be counting negatively this part 
of the area, I mean, as usual when I do an integral. 

OK, so what I will do to evaluate this, I w ill first do what's called the inner integral. 
So, to do the inner integra l, well, it's pretty easy. How do I integrate this? Well, it 
becomes, so, what's the  integral of one? It's y. Just anything to remember is we are 
integrating this w ith respect to y, not to x. The integra l of x^2 is x^2 times y. And, 
the integral of y^2 is y^3 over 3. OK, and that we plug in the bounds, which are 
zero and one in this case. And so, when you plug y equals one, you w ill get one 
minus x^2 minus one third minus, well, for y equals zero you get 0, 0, 0, so nothing 
changes. OK, so you are left w ith two thirds minus x^2. 

OK, and that's a  function of x only. Here, you shouldn't see any y's anymore because 
y was your integration variab le. But, you still have x. You still have x because the 
area of this shaded slice depends, of course, on the value of x. And, so now, the 
second thing to do is to do the outer integra l. So, now we integrate from zero to one 
what we got, which is two thirds minus x^2 dx. OK, and we know how to compute 
that because that integrates to two thirds x minus one third x^3 between zero and 
one. 

And, I'll let you do the computation. You will find it's one third. OK, so that's the fina l 
answer. So,  that's the general pattern. When we have a doub le integral to compute, 
first we want to set it up carefully. We want to find, what will be the bounds in x and 
y? And here, that was actually pretty easy because our equation was very simple. 
Then, we want to compute the inner integral, and then we compute the outer 
integral. And, that's it. 

OK, any questions at this point? No? OK, so, by the way, we started w ith dA in the 
notation, right? Here we had dA. And, that somehow became a dy dx. OK, so, dA 
became dy dx because when we do the iterated integral this way, what we're 
actually doing is that we are slicing our origin into small rectang les. OK, that was the 
area of this small rectang le here? Well, it's the product of its width times its height. 
So, that's delta x times delta y. OK, so, delta a equa ls delta x delta y becomes... 

So actually, it's not just becomes, it's rea lly equal. So, the sma ll rectangles for. Now, 
it became dy dx and not dx dy. Well, that's a question of, in which order we do  the 
iterated integra l? It's up to us to decide whether we want to  integrate x first, then y, 
or y first, then x. But, as we'll see very soon, that is an important decision when it 
comes to setting up the bounds of integration. Here, it doesn't matter, but in genera l 
we have to be very careful about in which order we will do things. Yes? Well, in 
principle it always works both ways. 

Sometimes it w ill be that because the reg ion has a strange shape, you can actually 
set it up more easily one way or the other. Sometimes it will also be that the 
function here, you actua lly know how to integrate in one way, but not the other. So, 
the theory is that it should work both ways. In practice, one of the two calculations 

may be much harder. OK. Let's do another example. Let's say that what I wanted to 
know was not actually what I computed, namely, the volume below the paraboloid, 
but a lso the negative of some part that's now in the corner towards me. But let's say 
really what I wanted was just the volume between the paraboloid and the xy plane, 
so looking only at the part of it that sits above the xy plane. 

So, that means, instead of integrating over the entire square of size one, I should 
just integrate over the quarter d isk. I should stop integrating where my paraboloid 
hits the xy plane. So, let me draw another p icture. So, let's say I wanted to 
integrate, actua lly -- So, let's ca ll this example two. So, we are going to do the same 
function but over a d ifferent region. And, the region will just be, now, this quarter 
disk here. OK, so maybe I should draw a picture on the xy p lane. That's your region, 
R. 

OK, so  in princip le, it will be the same  integral. But what changes  is the bounds. Why 
do the bounds change? Well, the bounds change because now if I set, if I fixed some 
value of x, then I want to integrate this part of the slice that's above the xy plane 
and I don't want to take this part that's actua lly outside of my disk. So, I should stop 
integrating over y when y reaches this value here. OK, on that p icture here, on this 
picture, it tells me for a fixed value of x, the range of values for y should go only 
from here to here. So, that's from here to less than one. 

OK, so  for a g iven, x, the range of y is, well, so what's the lowest value of y that we 
want to look at? It's still zero. From y equals zero to,what's the va lue of y here? 
Well, I have to solve in the equation of a circle, OK? So, if I'm here, this is x^2 y^2 
equa ls one. That means y is square root of one minus x^2. OK, so I w ill integrate 
from y equa ls zero to y equa ls square root of one minus x^2. And, now you see how 
the bound from y w ill depend on the value of x. OK, so while I erase, I w ill let you 
think about, what is the bound for x now? 

It's a trick question. OK, so I cla im that what we will do -- We write this as an 
iterated integra l first dy then dx. And, we said  for a fixed va lue of x, the range for y 
is from zero to square root of one minus x^2. What about the range for x? Well, the 
range for x should just be numbers. OK, remember, the question I have to ask now 
is if I look at a ll of these yellow slices, which one is the first one that I w ill consider? 
Which one is the last one that I want to consider? So, the sma llest value of x that I 
want to consider is zero again. 

And then, I w ill have actua lly a pretty big slice. And I will get smaller, and sma ller, 
and sma ller slices. And, it stops. I have to stop when x equals one. Afterwards, 
there's nothing else to integrate. So, x goes from zero to one. OK, and now, see how 
in the inner integral,  the bounds depend on in the inner integral, the bounds depend 
on x. In the outer one, you just get numbers because the questions that you have to 
ask to set up this one and set up that one are d ifferent. 

Here, the question is, if I fix a given, x,  if I look at a given slice, what's the range for 
y? Here, the question is, what's the first slice? What is the last slice? Does that make 
sense? Everyone happy with that? OK, very good. So, now, how do we compute 
that? Well, we do the inner integra l. So, that's an integral from zero to square root of 
one minus x^2 of one minus x^2 minus y^2 dy. And, well, that integrates to y-
x^2y-y^3 over three from zero to square root of one minus x^2. 

And then, that becomes, well, the root of one minus x^2 minus x^2 root of one 
minus x^2 minus y minus x^2 to the three halves over three. And actua lly, if you 
look at it for long enough, see, this says one minus x^2 times square root of one 
minus x^2. So, actua lly, that's a lso, so, in fact, that simplifies to two thirds of one 
minus x^2 to the three halves. OK, let me redo that, maybe, slightly differently. This 
was one minus x^2 times y. So --

-- one minus x^2 times y becomes square root of one minus x^2 minus y^3 over 
three. And then, when I take y equals zero, I get zero. So, I don't subtract anything. 
OK, so now you see this is one minus x^2 to  the three halves minus a third of it. So, 
you're left with two thirds. OK, so, that's the integral. The outer integra l is the 
integral from zero to one of two thirds of one minus x^2 to the three halves dx. 

And, well, I let you see if you remember sing le variab le  integrals by trying to figure 
out what this actua lly comes out to be is it pi over two, or pi over eight, actua lly? I 
think it's p i over eight. OK, well I guess we have to do it then. I wrote something on 
my notes, but it's not very clear, OK? So, how do we compute this thing? Well, we 
have to do trig substitution. That's the only way I know to compute an integral like 
that, OK? So, we'll set x equa l sine theta, and then square root of one minus x^2 w ill 
be cosine theta. 

We are using sine squared plus cosine squared equa ls one. And, so that w ill become 
-- -- so, two thirds remains two thirds. One minus x^2 to the three ha lves becomes 
cosine cubed theta. dx, well, if x is sine theta, then dx is cosine theta d theta. So, 
that's cosine theta d theta. And, well, if you do things with substitution, which is the 
way I do them, then you should worry about the bounds for theta which will be zero 
to p i over two. Or, you can a lso just plug in the bounds at the end. 

So, now you have the two thirds times the integral from zero to pi over two of cosine 
to the fourth theta d theta. And, how do you integrate that? Well, you have to use 
double angle formulas. OK, so cosine to the fourth, remember, cosine squared theta 
is one plus cosine two theta over two. And, we want the square of that. And, so that 
will give us -- -- of, well, we'll have, it's actually one quarter plus one ha lf cosine to 
theta plus one quarter cosine square to theta d theta. And, how w ill you hand le this 
guy? Well, using, again, the double ang le formula. OK, so it's getting slightly nasty. 
So, but I don't know any simp ler solution except for one simpler solution, which  is 
you have a  table of integrals of this form inside the notes. Yes? 

No, I don't think so because if you take one half times cosine half times two, you w ill 
still have half, OK? So, if you do, aga in, the double ang le formula, I think I'm not 
going to bother to do it. I cla im you w ill get, at the end, pi over eight because I say 
so. OK, so exercise, continue calculating and get pi over eight. OK, now what does 
the show us? Well, this shows us, actua lly, that this is probab ly not the right way to 
do this. OK, the right way to do this w ill be to integrate it in polar coordinates. And, 
that's what we will learn how to do tomorrow. 

So, we w ill actually see how to do it with much less trig. So, that will be easier in 
polar coord inates. So, we will see that tomorrow. OK, so we are almost there. I 
mean, here you just use a doub le ang le aga in and then you can get  it. And, it's 
pretty straightforward. OK, so one thing that's kind of interesting to know is we can 
exchange the order of integration. Say we have an integral given to us in the order 
dy dx, we can switch it to dx dy. But, we have to be extremely careful w ith the 
bounds. So, you certainly cannot just swap the bounds of the  inner and outer 

because there you would end up having this square root of one minus x^2 on the 
outside, and you would never get a number out of that. 

So, that cannot work. It's more complicated than that. OK, so, well, here's a first 
baby examp le. Certa inly, if I do integral from zero to one, integra l from zero to two 
dx dy, there, I can certa inly switch the bounds without thinking too much. What's 
the reason  for that? Well, the reason for that is this corresponds in both cases to 
integrating x from zero to two, and y from zero  to one. It's a  rectangle. So, if I slice 
it this way, you see that y goes from zero to one for any x between zero and two. 
It's this guy. If I slice it that way, then x goes from zero to two for any va lue of y 
between zero and one. And, it's this one. So, here it works. But in genera l, I have to 
draw p icture of my region, and see how the slices look like both ways. 

OK, so  let's do a more interesting one. Let's say that I want to compute an integra l 
from zero to one of integra l from x to square root of x of e^y over y dy dx. So, why 
did I choose this guy? Which is the guy because as far as I can tell, there's no way to 
integrate e^y over y. So, this is an integra l that you cannot compute this way. So, 
it's a good examp le for why this can be useful. So, if you do it this way, you are 
stuck immediately. So, instead, we will try to sw itch the order. But, to switch the 
order, we have to understand, what do these bounds mean? OK, so let's draw a 
picture of the region. Well what I am saying is y equals x to y equals square root of 
x. 

Well, let's draw y equals x, and y equals square root of x. Well, maybe I should 
actually put this here, y equals x to y equals square root of x. OK, and so I will go, 
for each value of x I will go from y equa ls xo to y equa ls square root of x. And then, 
we'll do that for va lues of x that go  from x equa ls zero to x equals one, which 
happens to be exactly where these things  intersect. So, my region w ill consist of a ll 
this, OK? So now, if I want to do it the other way around, I have to decompose my 
region. 

The other way around, I have to, so my goal, now, is to rewrite this as an integral. 
Well, it's still the same function. It's still e to the y over y. But now, I want to 
integrate dx dy. So, how do I integrate over x? Well, I fix a value of y. And, for that 
value of y, what's the range of x? Well, the range for x  is from here to here. OK, 
what's the va lue of x here? Let's start with an easy one. 

This is x equals y. What about this one? It's x equals y^2. OK, so, x goes from y2 to 
y, and then what about y? Well, I have to start at the bottom of my region. That's y 
equa ls zero to the top, which is at y equa ls one. So, y goes from zero to one. So, 
switching the bounds is not completely obvious. That took a  little bit of work. But 
now that we've done that, well, just to see how it goes, it's actually going to be 
much easier to integrate because the  inner integral, well, what's the integral of e^y 
over y with respect to x? It's just that times x, right, from x equals y^2 to y. 

So, that will be, well, if I plug x equa ls y, I will get e to the y minus, if I p lug x 
equa ls y^2, I w ill get e to the y over y times y^2 into the y times y, OK? So, now, if 
I do the outer integra l, I will have the integra l from zero to one of e to the y minus 
y^e to the y dy. And,  that one actually is a little bit easier. So, we know how to 
integrate e^y. We don't quite know how to integrate ye^y. But, let's try. So, let's 
see, what's the derivative of ye^y? Well, there's a product rule that's one times e^y 
plus y times the derivative of e^y is ye^y. 

So, if we do, OK, let's put a minus sign in front. Well, that's a lmost what we want, 
except we have a minus e^y instead of a plus e^y. So, we need to add 2e^y. And, I 
cla im that's the antiderivative. OK, if you got lost, you can also integrate by 
integrating by parts, by taking the derivative of y and integrating these guys. Or, 
but, you know, that works. Just, your first guess would be, maybe, let's try minus 
y^e to the y. 

Take the derivative of that, compare, see what you need to do to  fix. And so, if you 
take that between zero and one, you'll actually get e minus two. OK, so, tomorrow 
we are going to see how to do double integrals in polar coord inates, and also 
applications of double integra ls, how to use them for interesting things.
