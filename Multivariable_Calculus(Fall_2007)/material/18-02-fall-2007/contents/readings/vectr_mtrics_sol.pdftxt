b)  A  =  IAl  dir  A  = 2 i  + 4 j  - 4 k .   Let  P  be  i ts   ta i l   and  Q  i ts   head.  Then 
OQ = O P  + A  = 4 j  - 3 k ;  therefore  Q = ( 0 , 4 ,  -3). 
1A - 4   a)  O X  = O P  + P X  = O P  + ~ ( P Q )= O P  + $ (OQ  - O P )  = $ (OP   + OQ )  
b)  O X  = s O P  + r OQ ;  replace  3 by  r  in  above; use  1- r  = s. 
1A - 5   A  = i&i + i j  .  Th e   condition  is  not  redundant  since  there  a re   two  vectors  of 
length  3 making  an  angle of  30°  with  i .

b)  cos a = a l d a 2  + b2 + c2 ,  etc.; dir  A  = ( -1 /3 ,2 /3 ,2 /3 )  
c) if  t ,  v ,  v a re  direction  cosines of  some A ,  then  t i  + v  j  + v  k  = dir A ,  a unit  vector, 
so t 2  + v 2+ v2 = 1;conversely, if  this relation  holds, then  t i  + v j + v k  = u is a unit  vector, 
so dir  u = u and  t ,  v ,  v  a re  th e  direction  cosines of  u. 

1A - 9   Letting  A  and B  be  the  two sides, the  th i rd  side is  B - A ;   th e  line 
joining  the  two midpoints is  $B- $A ,  which = $ (B  - A ) ,  a vector  parallel 
t o  th e  th i rd   side and  half  i ts  length. 

1A - 1 0   Letting A ,  B ,  C , D  be the  four sides; then if  the  vectors a r e  suitably 
oriented, we  have A  + B  = C + D .  
Th e   vector  from  the   midpoint  of  A  t o   the   midpoint  of  C  is  $ C  - + A ;  similarly,  th e  
vector joining  th e  midpoints of  the  other  two  sides is  $B - $D ,  and 
A + B = C + D  
C - A = B - D  
$ ( C - A ) = $ ( B - D ) ;  

thus  two opposite sides  a re  equal  and parallel, which  shows th e  figure is  a  parallelogram. 

1A - 1 1  Letting  the   four vertices be  0,P, Q ,  R ,  with  X  on  P R  and Y  on  OQ, 
OX  =  O P + P X   =  O P + + P R  
=  O P  + + (OR  - O P )  
=  i ( O R + O P )   =  $OQ  =  OY ;  

therefore  X  = Y.

which  says the  two  sides are perpendicular,  i.e., the parallelogram is  a  rectangle. 

1B -11   Using  the notation  of  the  previous exercise, we  have successively, 

(A  + B )  . (A  - B )   =  A  . A - B  . B ;  
therefore, 
( A + B ) . ( A - B )   =  0 
A . A   =  B . B ,  

i.e., the  diagonals are perpendicular  if  and  only  if  two  adjacent  edges have  equal length,  in 
other  words, if  the  parallelogram is  a  rhombus. 

1B -12   Let  0 be  the  center of  the  semicircle, Q  and  R  the  two  ends  of  the   diameter, and 
P the vertex  of  the  inscribed angle; set A  = QO = OR and B  = O P ;  then  IAl  = IBI. 
The angle sides are Q P  = A + B  and  P R  = A  - B ;  they  are perpendicular  since 

( A + B ) . ( A - B )   =  A . A - B . B

according t o  the  formula for  evaluating the dot  product  in  terms  of  components. 

1B -14   Let  the  coterminal vectors A  and  B  represent  two  sides  of  the  triangle,  and  let  0 
be  the included angle.  Suitably directed, the  third  side is  then  C  = A  - B ,  and
