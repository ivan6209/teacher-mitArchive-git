18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2010 
Transcript – Lecture 2 

Okay. This is it. The second lecture  in linear a lgebra, and I've put below my ma in 
topics for today. I put right there a system of equations that's going to be our 
example to work with. 

But what are we going to do w ith it? We're going to solve it. And the method of 
solution will not be determinants. Determinants are something that will come later. 
The method we'll use is ca lled elimination. And it's the way every software package 
solves equations. And elimination, well, if it succeeds,  it gets the answer. And 
normally  it does succeed. If the matrix A that's coming into that system is a good 
matrix, and I think this one is, then elimination will work. We'll get the answer in an 
efficient way. But why don't we, as long as we're sort of seeing how elimination 
works -- it's always good to ask how could it fail? So at the same time, we'll see how 
elimination decides whether the matrix is a good one or has prob lems. 

Then to complete the answer, there's an obvious step of back substitution. In fact, 
the idea of elimination is -- you would have thought of it, right? I mean Gauss 
thought of it before we d id, but only because he was born earlier. It's a natura l 
idea... 

and died earlier, too. 

Okay, and you've seen the  idea. But now, the part that I want to show you is 
elimination expressed in matrix language, because the whole course -- all the key 
ideas get expressed as matrix operations, not as words. 

And one of the operations, of course, that we'll meet is how do we multiply matrices 
and why? Okay, so there's a system of equations. 

Three equations and three unknowns. 

And there's the matrix, the three by three matrix -- so this is the system Ax = b. 
This is our system  to solve, Ax equa l -- and the right-hand side is that vector 2, 12, 
2. Okay. 

Now, when I describe elimination -- it gets to be a pa in to keep writing  the equa l 
signs and the pluses and so on. 

It's that matrix that totally matters. 

Everything is in that matrix. But behind it is those equations. So what does 
elimination do? What's the first step of elimination? We accept the first equation, it's 
okay. 

I'm going to multiply that equation by the right number, the right multiplier and I'm 
going to subtract it from the second equation. W ith what purpose? So that will decide 
what the multiplier should be. 

Our purpose  is to knock out the x part of equation two. 

So our purpose is to eliminate x. So what do I multip ly -- and aga in, I'll do it with 
this matrix, because I can do it short. 

What's the multiplier here? What do I multiply -- equation one and subtract. Notice 
I'm saying that word subtract. I'd like to stick to that convention. I'll do a 
subtraction. 

First of all this is the key number that I'm starting with. 

And that's called the p ivot. I'll put a box around it and write its name down. That's 
the first pivot. 

The first p ivot. Okay. 

So I'm going to use -- that's sort of like the key number in that equation. And now 
what's the multiplier? So I'm going to -- my first row won't change, that's the p ivot 
row. But I'm going to use it -- and now, fina lly, let me ask you what the multiplier is. 
Yes? 3. 3 times that first equation w ill knock out that 3. Okay. 

So what will it leave? So the multip lier is 3. 

3 times that will make that 0. That was our purpose. 3 2s away from the 8 w ill leave 
a 2 and three 1s away from 1 will leave a minus 2. And this guy didn't change. Okay. 
Now the next step -- this is forward elimination and that step's completed. 

Oh, well, you could say wait a minute, what about the right hand side? Shall I carry -
- the right-hand side gets carried a long. Actua lly MatLab  finishes up w ith the left side 
before -- and then just goes back to do  the right side. Maybe I'll be MatLab for a 
moment and do that. Okay. 

I'm leaving a  room for a column of b, the right-hand side. 

But I'll fill it in later. Okay. Now  the next step of elimination is what? Well, strictly 
speaking... this position that I cleaned up was like the 2, 1 position, row 2, column 1. 
So I got a 0 in the 2, 1 position. I'll use 2,1 as the index of that step. The next step 
should be to finish the column and get a 0 in that position. 

So the next step  is rea lly the 3,1 step, row three, column one. But of course, I 
already have 0. Okay. 

So the multiplier is 0. I take 0 of this equation away from this one and I'm all set. So 
I won't repeat that, but there was a step there which, MatLab would have to look --
it would look at this number and, do that step, unless you told it in advance that it 
was 0. 

Okay. Now what? Now we can see the second pivot, which is what? The second pivot 
-- see, we've eliminated -- x is now gone from this equation, right? We're down to 
two equations in y and z. 

And so now I just do it again. L ike, everything's very cursive at this -- this is  like --
such a basic algorithm and you've seen it, but carry me through one  last step. So 
this is still the first p ivot. Now the second pivot  is this guy, who has appeared there. 
And what's the multip lier, the appropriate multiplier now? And what's my purpose? Is 
it to wipe out the 3, 2 position, right? This was the 2, 1 step. 

And now I'm going to take the 3, 2 step. 

So this all stays the same, 1 2 1, 0 2 -1 and the pivots are there. Now I'm using this 
pivot, so what's the multiplier? 2. 

2 times this equation, this row, gets subtracted  from this row and makes that a 0. So 
it's 0, 0 and is it a 5? Yeah, I guess it's a 5, is that right? Because I have a one there 
and I'm subtracting tw ice of twice this, so I think it's a 5 there. There's the third 
pivot. 

So let me put a box around all three pivots. 

Is there a -- oh, d id I just invent a negative one? I'm sorry that the tape can't, 
correct that as easily as I can. 

Okay. Thank you very much. 

You get an A in the course now. Is that correct? Is it correct now? Okay. 

So the three p ivots are there -- I know right away a lot about this matrix. This 
elimination step from A -- this matrix I'm going  to ca ll U. U  for upper triangular. 

So the whole purpose of elimination was to get from A to U. And, litera lly, that's the 
most common calculation in scientific computing. And peop le think of how could I do 
that faster? Because it's a major, major thing. But we're doing it the straightforward 
way. We found three p ivots, and by the way, I d idn't say this, pivots can't be 0. I 
don't accept 0 as a p ivot. 

And I didn't get 0. So  this matrix  is great. 

It gave me three pivots, I didn't have to do anything specia l, I just followed the rules 
and, and the p ivots are 1, 2 and 5. By the way,  just because I always anticipate stuff 
from a later day,  if I wanted to know the determinant of this matrix -- which I never 
do want to know, but I would just multiply the p ivots. The determinant is 10. 

So even things like the determinant are here. 

Okay. Now -- oh, let me talk about failure for a moment, and then -- and then come 
back to success. How could this have fa iled? How could -- by fail, I mean to come up 
with three pivots. I mean, there are a couple of points. I would have a lready been in 
trouble if this very first number here was 0. 

If it was a 0 there -- suppose that had been a 0, there were no Xs in that equation --
first equation. Does that mean I can't solve the problem? Does that mean I quit? No. 

What do I do? I sw itch rows. 

I exchange rows. So in case of a 0, I will not say 0 p ivot. I w ill never be heard to 
utter those words, 0 p ivot. But if there's a 0 in the pivot position, maybe I can say 
that, I would try to exchange for a lower equation and get a proper pivot up there. 

Okay. Now, for example, this second pivot came out two. Could it have come out 0? 
What -- actually, if I change that 8 a little bit, I would have got a little trouble. 

What should I change that 8 to so that I run into trouble? A 6. If that had been a 6, 
then this would have been 0 and I couldn't have used that as the pivot. But I could 
have exchanged again. In this case. 

In this case, because when can I get out of trouble? I can get out of troub le if there's 
a non-0 below this troub lesome 0. And there  is here. So I would be okay in this case. 
If this was a 6, I would survive by a  row exchange. 

Now -- of course, it might have happened that I couldn't do the row,  that -- that 
there was 0s below it, but here there wasn't. Now, I could a lso have got in trouble if 
this number 1 was a little different. 

See, that 1 became a 5, I guess, by the end. 

So can you see what number there would have got me troub le that I really couldn't 
get out of? Trouble that I couldn't get out of would mean if 0 is in the pivot position 
and I've got no p lace to exchange. 

So there must be some number which if I had had here it would have meant fa ilure. 
Negative 4, good. 

If it was a negative 4 here -- if it happened to be a negative 4, I'll temporarily put it 
up here. If this had been a negative 4 z,  then I would have gone through the same 
steps. This would have been a minus 4,  it still would have been a minus 4. 

But at the last minute  it would have become 0. 

And there wouldn't have been a third p ivot. 

The matrix would have not been invertib le. 

Well, of course, the inverse of a matrix is coming next week, but, you've heard these 
words before. So,  that's how we identify failure. There's temporary failure when we 
can do a row exchange -- and get out of it, or there's comp lete fa ilure when we get a 
0 and -- and there's nothing below that we can use. 

Okay. Let's stay w ith -- back to success now. In fact, I guess the next top ic is back 
substitution. So what's back substitution? Well, now I'd better bring the right-hand 
side in. So what would MatLab do and what should we do? Let me bring in the right-
hand side as an extra column. 

So there comes B. So it's 2, 12, 2. I would ca ll this the augmented matrix. 
"Augment" means you've tacked something on. I've tacked on this extra column. 
Because, when I'm working w ith equations, I do the same thing to both sides. So, at 
this step, I subtracted 2 of the first equation away from the second equation so that 
this augmented -- I even brought some colored cha lk, but I don't know if it shows 
up. So this  is like the augmented -- no! Damn, circled the wrong thing. 

Okay. Here is b. Okay, that's the extra column. Okay. 

So what happened to that extra column, the right-hand side of the equations, when I 
did the first step? So that was 3 of this away from this, so it took -- the 2 stayed the 
same, but three 2s got taken away from 12, leaving 6, and that 2 stayed the same. 

So this is how  it's looking halfway a long. 

And let me just carry to  the end. 

The 2 and the 6 stay the same, but -- what do I have here? Oh, gosh. Help me out, 
now. What -- so now I'm -- This is still like forward elimination. 

I got to this point, which I think is right, and now what d id I do at this step? I 
multip lied that p ivot by 2 or that whole equation by 2 and subtracted from that, so I 
think I take two 6s, which is 12, away from the 2. Do you think minus 10 is my final 
right-hand side -- the right-hand side that goes with U, and let me ca ll that once and 
forever the vector c. So c is what happens to b, and U  is what happens to A. Okay. 

There you've seen elimination clean. 

Okay. Oh, what's back substitution? So what are my final equations, then? Can I 
copy these equations? x+2y+z=2 is still there and 2y-2z=6 is there, and 5z=-10. 

Okay. Those are the equations that these numbers are telling me about. 

Those are the equations U x equals c. 

Okay, how do I solve them? What one do I solve for first? z. I see immed iately that 
the correct value of z is negative 2. 

And what do I do next? I go back upwards. 

I now know z here. So, if z is negative 2, that's 4 there,  is that right? And so 2 y plus 
a 4 is 6, maybe y is 1. Going -- this is back substitution. 

We're doing  it on the fly because it's so easy. And then x is -- so x -- 2y is 2 minus 
2, maybe x is 2? So you see what back substitution is. It's the simple step solving 
the equations in reverse order because the system is triangular. Okay. 

Good. So that's elimination and back substitution, and I kept the right-hand side 
along. Okay, now what do I -- that, like, is first piece of the lecture. 

What's the second p iece? Matrices are going to get in. So I wrote stuff with x, y-s 
and z-s  in there, then I really, got the right shorthand, just writing the matrix 
entries, and now I want to write the operations that I did in matrices, right? I've 

carried the matrices a long, but I haven't said the operation those elimination steps, I 
now want to express as matrices. Okay. 

Here they come. So now this is elimination matrices. Okay. 

Let me take that first step, which took me from 1 2 1 3 8 1 0 4 1. I want to operate 
on that -- I want to do elimination on that. Okay. 

Okay, now I'm remembering a point I want to single out as especially important. Let 
me move the board up for that. Because when we do matrix operations, we've got 
to, like, be able to see the big p icture. Okay. 

Last time, I spoke about the b ig p icture of -- when I multip ly a matrix by a  right-
hand side. 

If I have some matrix there and I multip ly it by 3 4 5, let's say -- so here's a matrix 
-- what did  I say -- well, I guess I only said it on the videotape, but -- do you 
remember how  I look at that matrix multiplication? The result of multip lying a matrix 
by some vector is a comb ination of the columns of the matrix. It's 3 times the first 
column. 

It's 3 times column one plus 4 times column two plus 5 times column three. Okay. 

I'm going to come back to that multip le times. 

What I wanted to do now was to emphasize the parallel thing with rows. Why? 
Because all our operations here for this two weeks of the course are row operations. 
So this isn't what I need  for row operations. Let me do a row operation. 

Suppose I have my matrix aga in and suppose I multip ly on the left by some -- let's 
say 1 2 7. Again, I'm just,  like, saying what the result is. And then we'll say how 
matrix multiplication works and we'll see that it's true. Okay. 

But maybe already I'm making -- I'm sort of bringing up -- the central idea of linear 
algebra is how these matrices work by rows as well as by columns. Okay. 

How does it work by rows? What -- so that's a row vector. 

I could say that's a one by three matrix, a row vector multiplying a three by three 
matrix. 

What's the output? What's the product of a  row  times a matrix? And -- okay, it's a 
row. A row -- a column -- I'm sorry. 

A matrix times a column  is a column. 

So matrix times a -- yeah. Matrix times a column is a column. And we know what 
column it is. 

Over here, I'm doing a row times a matrix. 

And what's the answer? It's one of that first row, so it's 1 times -- 1 times row one, 
plus 2 times row two plus 7 times row three. When -- as we do matrix multiplication, 

keep your eye on what it's doing with whole vectors. And what it's doing -- what it's 
doing in this case is it's comb ining the rows. And we have a combination, a linear 
combination of the rows. Okay, I want to use that. 

Okay, so my question is what's the matrix that does this first step, that takes --
subtracts 3 of equation one from equation two? That's what I want to do. 

So this is going to be a matrix that's going to subtract 3 times row one from row 
two, and leaves the other rows the same. Just in -- I mean, the answer is going to 
be that. So whatever matrix this is -- and you're going to, like, tell me what matrix 
will do it, it's the matrix that leaves the first row unchanged, leaves the last row 
unchanged, but takes 3 of these away from  this so it puts a 0 there, a 2 there and a 
minus 2. 

Good. What matrix will do it? It's these. It should be a pretty simple matrix, because 
we're doing a very simple step. 

We're just doing this step that changes row two. 

So actually, row one is not chang ing. 

So tell me how the matrix should begin. 

One -- the first row of the matrix w ill be 1 0 0, because that's just the right thing 
that takes one of that row and none of the other rows, and that's what we want. 

What's the last row of the matrix? 0 0 1, because that takes one of the third row and 
none of the other rows, that's great. Okay. 

Now, suppose I didn't want to do anything at all. 

Suppose my row -- well, I guess maybe I had a case here when I already had a 0 
and, d idn't have to do anything. 

What matrix does nothing, like, just  leaves you where you were? If I put in -- if I put 
in 0 1 0, that would be -- that would be -- that's the matrix -- what's the name of 
that matrix? The identity matrix, right. So it does absolutely nothing. 

It just multip lies everything and leaves it where it is. 

It's like a one, like the number one, for matrices. But that's not what we want, 
because we want to change this row to -- so what's the correct -- what should I put 
in here now to do it right? I want to get -- what do I want? What I -- I'm after -- I 
want 3 of row one to get subtracted off. 

So what's the right matrix, finish that matrix for me. 

Negative 3 goes here? And what goes here? That 1. And what goes here? The 0. 
That's the good matrix. 

That's the matrix that takes minus 3 of row one plus the row two and gives the new 
row 2. Should we just, like, check some particular entry? How do I check a particular 

entry of a matrix in matrix multip lication? Like, suppose I wanted to check the entry 
here that's in row two, column three. 

So where does the entry in row two, column three come from? I would look at row 
two of this guy and column three of this one to get that number. That number comes 
from the second row and the third column and I just take this dot product minus 3 --
I'm multiplying -- minus 3 p lus 1 and 0 g ives the minus 2. Yeah. 

It works. So we got various ways to multiply matrices now. We're sort of, like --
informally. We've got by columns, we've got -- well, we w ill have by columns, by 
rows, by each entry at a time. 

But it's good to see that matrix multip lication when one of the matrices is so simp le. 
So this guy is our elementary matrix. Let's call it E for elementary or elimination. 
And let me put the indexes 2 1, because it's the matrix that we needed to fix the 2 1 
position. It's the matrix that we needed to get this 2 1 position to be 0. Okay. Good 
enough. So what do I do next? I need another matrix, right? I need to -- there's 
another step here. 

And I want to express the whole elimination process in matrix language. So tell me 
what -- so next step, step two, which was what? Subtract -- what was -- what was 
the actual step that we did? I think I subtracted  -- do you remember? I had a 2 in 
the p ivot and a 4 below it, so I subtracted two times -- times row two  from row 
three. From row three. Tell me the matrix that will do that. And tell me  its name. 
Okay, it's going to be E,  for elementary or elimination matrix and what's the index 
number that I used to tell me what E -- 3, 2, right? Because it's fixing this 3 2 
position. 

And what's the matrix, now? Okay, you remember -- so E 3 2 is supposed to multip ly 
my guy that I have and it's supposed to produce the right result, which was -- it 
leaves -- it's supposed to leave the first row, it's supposed to leave the second row 
and it's supposed to straighten out that third row to  this. 

And what's the matrix that does that? 1 0 0, right? Because we don't change the first 
row and the next row we don't change either, and the last row is the one we do 
change. 

And what do I do? Let's see, I subtract two times -- so what's this row? What's this 
here? 0, right, because the first row's not involved. 

It's just in the 3 2 position, isn't it? This the key number is this minus the multip lier 
that goes -- sitting there in that 3 2 position. 

Is it a minus 2 to subtract 2 and then this is a 1 so that -- the overall effect is to  take 
minus 2 of this row plus 1 of that. Okay. 

So, I've now given you the pieces,  the elimination matrices, the elementary matrices 
that take each step. 

So now what? Now the next point in the lecture  is to put those steps together into a 
matrix that does it a ll and see how  it all happens. 

So now I'm going to express the whole -- everything we d id today so  far on A was to 
start w ith A, we multiplied it by E 2 1, that was the first step -- and then we 
multip lied that result by E 3 2 and that led us to this thing and what was that 
matrix? U. You see why I like matrix notation, because there in, like, little space -- a 
few b its when its compressed on the web -- is everything -- is this whole lecture. 

Okay. Now  there -- there are important facts about matrix multip lication. 

And we're close to maybe the most important. 

And that is this. Suppose I ask you this question. Suppose I start w ith a matrix A 
and I want to end with a matrix U and  I want to say what matrix does the whole job? 
What matrix takes me from A to U, using the letters I've got? And the answer is 
simple. 

I'm not asking this as -- but it's highly important. 

How would I create the matrix that does the whole job at once, that does all of 
elimination in one shot? It would be -- I would just put these together, right? In 
other words, this is the thing I'm struggling to say. 

I can move those parentheses. If I keep the matrices  in order -- I can't mess around 
with the order of the matrices, but I can change the order that I do the 
multip lications. 

I can multiply these two  first -- in other words, you see what those parentheses are 
doing? It's saying -- multip ly the Es first and that gives you the matrix that does 
everything at once. 

Okay. So this fact, that this is automatically the same as this -- for every matrix 
multip lication, which I'm conscious of still not telling you in every detail, but, like, 
you're seeing how it works -- and this is highly important -- and maybe tell me the 
long word that describes this law for matrices,  that you can move the parentheses? 
It's ca lled the associative law. 

I think you can now  forget that. 

But don't forget the law. I mean, like, forget the word associative. I don't know. 

But don't forget the law. Because actua lly, we'll see so many steps  in linear algebra, 
so many proofs, even, of main fact come from just moving the parentheses. And it's 
not that easy to prove that this is correct, you have to go into the gory deta ils of 
matrix multiplication, do it both ways and see that you come out the same. 

Maybe I'll leave the author to do that. 

Okay. So there we go. 

So there's a sing le matrix, I could ca ll it E -- while we're talking about these 
matrices, tell me one other -- there's another type of elementary matrix, and we 
already said why we might need it. 

We didn't need it in this case. But it's the matrix that exchanges two rows. It's called 
a permutation matrix. Can you just, like,  tell me what that would be? So I'm just --
like,  this is a slight digression and we'll -- yes, so let me get some -- let me figure 
out where I'm going to put a permutation matrix. 

You'll see I'm always squeezing stuff in. 

So permutation. Or, in fact this one you'll, like, exchange rows -- sha ll I exchange 
rows one and two, just to make life easy? So if I had my matrix -- no, let -- let me 
just do two by two. 

|a b; c d|. Suppose I want to find the matrix that exchanges those rows. What is it? 
So the matrix that exchanges those rows -- the row I want is c d and it's there. 

So I better take one of it. And the row I want here is up top, so I'll take one of that. 
So actually, I'm just -- the easy way -- this is my matrix that I'll call P,  for 
permutation. It's the matrix -- actua lly, the easy way to find it is just do  the thing to 
the identity matrix. Exchange the rows of the identity matrix and then that's the 
matrix that w ill do row exchanges for you. Suppose I wanted to exchange columns 
instead. Columns have hardly got into today's lecture, but they certainly are going to 
be around. How could I -- if I started w ith this matrix |a b; c d| then I wouldn't --
I'm not even going to write this down, I'm just going to ask you, because in 
elimination, we're doing rows. 

But suppose we wanted to exchange the columns of a matrix. How would I do that? 
What matrix multip lication would do that job? Actually, why not? I'll write it down. 

So this is -- I'll write it under here and then hide it aga in. Okay. 

Suppose I had my matrix |a b; c d| and I want to get to a c over here and b d here. 
What matrix does that job? Can I multiply -- can I cook up some matrix that 
produces that answer? You can see from where I put my hand I was really asking 
can I put a matrix here on the left that w ill exchange columns? And the answer is no. 

I'm just bringing out again this point that when I multip ly on the left, I'm doing row 
operations. 

So if I want to do a column operation, where do I put that permutation matrix? On 
the right. 

If I put it here, where I just barely left room for it -- so I'll exchange the two 
columns of the identity. 

Then it comes out right, because now I'm multip lying a column at a time. This is the 
first column and says take one -- take none of that column, one of this one and then 
you got it. 

Over here, take one of this one, none of this one and you've got a c. So,  in short, to 
do column operations, the matrix multiplies on the right. To do row operations, it 
multip lies on the left. Okay, okay, and it's row operations that we're rea lly doing. 

Okay. And of course, I mentioned in passing, but I better say  it very clearly that you 
can't exchange the orders of matrices. 

And that's just the point I was making aga in here. 

A times B is not the same as B times A. You have to keep these matrices in their 
Gauss given order here, right? But you can move the parentheses, so that, in other 
words, the commutative law, which would a llow you to take it in the other order is 
false. So we have to keep it in that order. Okay. 

So what next? I could do this multiplication. 

I could do E 32. So let me come back to see what that was. Here was E 2 1. 

And here is E 3 2. And if I multiply those two matrices together -- E 3 2 and then E 2 
1, I'll get a single matrix that does elimination. I don't want to do it that -- if I do 
that multiplication -- there -- there's a better way to do this. And so in this last few 
minutes of today's lecture, can I anticipate that better way? The better way is to 
think not how do I get from A to U, but how do I get from U back to A? So reversing 
steps is going to come in. Inverse -- I'll use the word inverse here. Okay. So let me 
make the first step at what's the inverse matrix? All the matrices you've seen on this 
board have  inverses. I d idn't write any bad matrices down. 

We spoke about possib le failure, and for a moment, we put in a matrix that would 
fail. 

But right now, a ll these matrices are good, they're a ll invertible. And let's take the 
inverse -- well, let me say first what does the inverse mean and find it? Okay. So 
we're getting a little leg up on inverses. Okay, so this is the final moments of today. 
Sorry, he's still there. 

Okay. Inverses. 

Okay, and I'm just going to take one example and then we're done. The example I'll 
take will be that E. So my matrix is 1 0 0 minus 3 1 0 0 0 1. And I want to find the 
matrix that undoes that step. So what was that step? The step was subtract 3 times 
row one from row two. 

So what matrix will get me back? What matrix w ill bring back -- you know, if I 
started with a 2 12 2 and I changed it to a 2 6 2 because of this guy, I want to get 
back to the 2 12 2. 

I want to  find the matrix which -- which undoes elimination, the matrix which 
multip lies this to give the identity. 

And you can tell me what I should do in words first, and then we'll write down the 
matrix that does it. 

If this step subtracted 3 times row 1 from row 2, what's the inverse step? I add 3 
times row one to row two, right? I add it back. 

The -- what I subtracted away, I add back. 

So the inverse matrix in this case is -- I now want to add 3 times row one to row 
two, so I won't change row one, I won't change row three and I'll add 3 times row 
one to row two. 

That's a case where the inverse is clear. 

It's clear in words what to do, because what this did was simple to express. It just 
changed  row two by subtracting 3 of row one. So to invert it, I go  that way. And if 
you -- if we do that ca lculation, 3 times this row plus 1 times this row, comes out the 
right row of the identity. 

Okay, so inverses are an -- so if this matrix was E and this matrix is I for identity, 
then what's the notation for this guy? E to  the minus one. 

E inverse. Okay. 

Let's stop there for today. That's a little jump on what's coming on Monday. So, see 
you Monday.
