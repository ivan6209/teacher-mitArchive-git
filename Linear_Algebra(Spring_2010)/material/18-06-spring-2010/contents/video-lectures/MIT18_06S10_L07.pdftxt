18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2010 
Transcript – Lecture 7 

OK, here's linear a lgebra lecture seven. 

I've been talking about vector spaces and specia lly the null space of a matrix and the 
column space of a matrix. 

What's in those spaces. Now  I want to actually describe them. How do you describe 
all the vectors that are in those spaces? How do you compute these things? So this is 
the, turning the idea, the definition, into an a lgorithm. 

What's the algorithm for solving A x =0? So that's the null space that I'm interested 
in. 

So can I take a particular matrix A and describe the natura l a lgorithm, and I'll 
execute it for that matrix -- here we go. So let me take the matrix as an example. 
So we're definitely talking rectangular matrices in this chapter. 

So I'll make, I'll have four columns. 

And three rows. Two four six eight and three six eight ten. OK. 

If I just look at those columns, and rows, well, I notice right away that column two is 
a multiple of column one. It's in the same direction as column one. It's not 
independent. I'll expect to discover that in the process. 

Actually, w ith rows, I notice that that row p lus this row gives the third  row. So the 
third row is not independent. So, all that should come out of elimination. So now 
what I -- my algorithm is elimination, but extended now to  the rectangular case, 
where we have to continue even if there's zeros in the pivot position, we go on. 

OK, so  let me execute elimination for that matrix. 

My goal is always, while I'm doing elimination -- I'm not changing the null space. 

That's very important, right? I'm solving A x equals zero by elimination, and when I 
do these operations that you a lready know, when I subtract a multiple of one 
equation from another equation, I'm not chang ing the solutions. So I'm not chang ing 
the null space. Actua lly, I chang ing the column space, as you'll see. So you have to 
pay attention. 

What does elimination leave unchanged? And the answer is the solutions to the 
system are not changed because I'm doing the same thing to -- I'm doing a 
leg itimate operations on the equations. Of course, on the right hand side it's always 
zero, and I don't plan to write zero all the time. OK, so I'm really just working on the 
left side, but the right side is, is keep ing up always zeros. OK, so what's elimination? 

Well, you know where the first pivot is and you know what to do with it. So can I just 
take the first step below here? So that pivot row is fine. 

I take two times that row away from this one and I get zero zero. That's signa ling a 
difficulty. 

Two, two twos away from the six leaves me with a two. 

Two twos away from the eight leaves me w ith a  four. 

And now three of those away from here is zero, again another zero, three twos away 
from that eight is the two, three twos away from that ten is a four. 

OK. That's the first stage of elimination. I've got the first column straight. So of 
course I move on to the second column. I look in that position, I see a zero. I  look 
below it, hoping  for a non-zero that I can do a row exchange. 

But it's zero below. So that's telling me that that column is -- well, what it's rea lly 
going to be telling me is that that column is a combination of the earlier columns. It's 
that second column is dependent on the earlier columns. 

But I don't stop to think here. In that column there's nothing to do. I go on to the 
next. 

So here's the next pivot. So there's the first p ivot and there's the second pivot, and I 
just keep this elimination going downwards. So, so the next step keeps the first row, 
keeps the second row w ith  its p ivot, so I've got my two p ivots, and does elimination 
to clear out the column below that pivot. So actually you see the multiplier is one. It 
subtracts row two  from row three and produces a row of zeros. 

OK. That I would ca ll that matrix U, right? That's our upper -- well, I can't quite say 
upper triangular. 

Maybe upper -- I don't know -- upper something. 

It's in this so-ca lled echelon form. 

The word echelon means, like, sta ircase form. 

It's the, the non-zeros come in that staircase form. 

If there was another pivot here, then the staircase would include that. But here's a 
case where we have two pivots only. OK, so actually we've already discovered the 
most important number about this matrix. The number of pivots is two. That number 
we will ca ll the rank of the matrix. So let me put immediately. 

The rank of A -- so I'm telling you what this word rank means  in the algorithm. It's 
equa l to the number of pivots. And in this case,  two. OK,  for me that number two  is 
the crucia l number. OK, now I go to -- you remember I'm always solving A x equa ls 
zero, but now I can solve U x equa ls zero, right? Same solution, same null space. 
OK. 

So I could stop here -- why don't I stop here and do the back substitution. So now I 
have to ask you, how do I describe the solutions? There are solutions, right, to A x 
equa ls zero. 

I knew there would be. I had three equations in four unknowns. I certainly expected 
some solutions. Now I want to see what are they. OK, here's the critical step. 

I refer to it up here as separating out the p ivot variables, the pivot columns, which 
are these two. 

Here I have two p ivot columns. Those, obviously, they're the columns with the 
pivots. 

So I have two pivot columns. And I have the other columns, I'll ca ll free. These are 
free columns, OK. Why do I use those words? Why do I use that word  free? Because 
now I want to write, I want to  find the solutions to U x equals zero. 

Here is the way I do it. These free columns I can assign any number freely to  those -
- to the variables x2 and x4, the ones that multiply columns two and four. 

So I can assign anything I like to x2 and x4. 

And then I can solve the equations for x1 and x3. 

Let me say that again. If I give -- let me, let me assign. So, so one particular x is to 
assign, say, the va lue one to the, to x2, and zero to x4. Those are -- that was a free 
choice, but it's a convenient choice. OK. 

Now I want to solve U x equa ls zero and find numbers one and three, complete the 
solution. OK. 

Can I write down -- let's see. Shall we just remember what U x equals zero 
represents? What are my equations? That first equation is x1 plus just -- I'm just 
saying what are these matrices meaning. That's the first equation. 

And the second equation was 2x3 + 4x4=0. 

Those are my two equations. OK. Now the point is I can find x1 and x3 by back 
substitution. 

So we're building on what we already know. 

The new thing is that there were some free variables that I could give any numbers 
to. And I'm systematica lly going to make a choice like this, 1 and 0. 

Now what is x3? Let's,  let's go backwards, back up. I look at the last equation. x3 is 
zero, from the last equation, because, because x4 we've set x4 to zero, and then we 
get x3 as zero. OK. 

Now we set x2 to be one, so what is x1? Negative two, right? So then I have 
negative two plus two, zero and zero, correctly giving zero. There  is a vector in the 
null space. There is a solution to A x equals zero. In fact, what solution is that? That 

simply says that minus two times the first column plus one times the second column 
is the zero column. 

Of course that's right. Minus two of that column plus one of that, or minus two of 
that plus one of that. 

That solution is -- that, that's just what we saw  immed iately, that the second column 
is tw ice as b ig as the first column. OK, tell me some more vectors in the null space. I 
found one. 

Tell me, how to get a bunch more immediately out of that one. Just take multiples of 
it. 

Any multip le of -- I could multiply this by anything. I might as well ca ll it, I could 
say, C, some multip le of this. So let me -- so X could be any multiple of this one. OK, 
that, that describes now a line, an infinitely long line in four d imensiona l space. But -
- which is in the null space. Is that the whole null space? No. 

I've got two free variab les here. 

I made this choice, one and zero, for the free variab les, but I could have made 
another choice. Let me make the other choice zero and one. You see my system. 

So let me repeat the system. This is the algorithm that you, you just learned to do. 
Do elimination. 

Decide which are the pivot columns and which are the free columns. That tells you 
that, that variables one and three are pivot variables, two and four are free 
variables. 

Then those free variables, you assign them -- you g ive one of them the va lue one 
and the others the va lue zero -- in this case, we had a one and a zero -- and 
complete the solution. 

And you do -- you give the other one the value one and zero. And now complete the 
solution. 

So let's comp lete that solution. 

I'm looking  for a vector in the null space, and it's absolutely going to be d ifferent 
from this guy, because, because any multip le of that zero is never going to give the 
one. So I have somebody new  in the null space, and let me finish it out. 

What's x3 here? So we're going by back substitution, looking at this equation. 

Now x4 we've changed, we're doing the other possib ility, where x2 is zero and x4 is 
one. 

So x3 w ill happen to be minus two. 

And now what do I get for that first equation? x1 -- let's see. Two x3s  is minus four 
plus two -- do I get a two there? Perhaps, yeah. 

Two for x1, minus four, and two. 

OK. That's in the null space. 

What does that say about the columns? That says that two of this column minus two 
of this column p lus this column g ives zero, which it does. 

Two of that minus two of that and one of that gives the zero column. OK, now, now 
I've found another vector in the null space. Now we're ready to tell me the whole null 
space. What are all the solutions to Ax=0? I've got this guy and when I have him, 
what else is, goes into the null space along with that? These are my two special 
solutions. I call them special -- I just invented that name. Specia l solutions. 

What's specia l about them is the specia l numbers I gave to the free variables, the 
values zero and one for the free variab les. I could have given the free variables any 
values and got vectors in the null space. 

But this was a good way to be sure I got t- got everybody. 

OK, so once I have him, I also have any multip le, right? So I could take any multip le 
of that and it's in the null space. And now what else -- I  left a little space for what? 
What -- a plus sign. 

I can take any combination. Here  is a line of vectors in the null space. A bunch of 
solutions. 

Would you rather I say in the null space or would you rather I say, OK, I'm solving 
Ax=0? Well, rea lly I'm solving Ux=0. 

Well, OK,  let me put in that crucia l p lus sign. 

I'm taking a ll the combinations of my two specia l solutions. 

That's my conclusion there. The null space conta ins, conta ins exactly all the 
combinations of the special solutions. And how many special solutions are there? 
There's one for every free variab le. And how many free variab les are there? Oh, I 
mean, we can see all the whole p icture now. If the rank R was two, this is the, this is 
the number of p ivot variables, right, because it counted the pivots. 

So how many free variables? Well, you know it's two, right? What is it in -- for a 
matrix that's m rows, n columns, n variab les that means, w ith rank r? How many 
free variables have we got left? If r of the variab les are pivot variab les, we have n-r -
- in this case four minus two -- free variables. Do you see that first of all we get 
clean answers here? We get r p ivot variab les -- so there rea lly were r equations 
here. 

There  looked like three equations, but there were rea lly only two independent 
equations. And there were n-r variab les that we could choose freely, and we gave 
them those special zero one values, and we got the special solutions. OK. 

For me -- we could stop at that point. 

That g ives you a comp lete algorithm for find ing all the solutions to A x equa ls zero. 
OK. 

Again, you do elimination -- going onward when a column, when there's nothing to 
be done on one column, you just continue. There's this number r, the number of 
pivots, is crucial, and it leaves n-r free variab les, which you g ive values zero and one 
to. I would like to take one more step. I would like to clean up this matrix even 
more. So now  I'm going to go to -- this is in its,  this is in echelon form, upper 
triangular if you like. I want to go one more step to make it as good as it can be. OK, 
so now  I'm going to speak about the reduced row echelon form. OK, so now I'm 
going to speak about the matrix R, which is the reduced  row echelon form. 

So what does that mean? That means I just -- I can, I can work harder on U. So let 
me start,  let me suppose I got as far as U, which was good. 

Notice how that row of zeros appeared. 

I d idn't comment on that, but I should have. 

That row of zeros up here is because row three was a combination of rows one and 
two, and elimination discovered that fact. When we get a  row of zeros, that's telling 
us that the -- original row that was there was a combination of other rows, and 
elimination knocked it out. 

OK, so we got this far. Now how can I clean that up further? I can do, elimination 
upwards. I can get zero above the p ivots. 

So this reduced  row echelon form has zeros above and below the pivots. So let me 
do that. 

So now I'll subtract one of this from the row above. 

That w ill leave a zero and a minus two in there. 

And that's good. OK, and I can clean it up even one more step. I can make the 
pivots -- the pivots I'm going to make equal to one, because I can d ivide equation 
two by the pivot. That won't change the solutions. So let me do  that. 

And then I really -- I'm ready to stop. 

One, two, zero, minus two, zero, zero, one, two. I divided the second equation by 
two, because now  I have a one in the p ivot and zeros below. 

OK. This is my matrix R. 

I guess I'm hoping that you could now execute the whole a lgorithm. Matlab w ill do it 
immed iately with the command -- reduced row echelon form of A. 

So if I input that original matrix A and then I write, then I type that command, press 
return, that matrix will appear. That's the reduced row echelon form, and it's got a ll 
the information as clear as can be. 

What, what information has it got? Well, of course it immediately tells me the pivot 
rows, pivot rows, one and two, p ivot columns, one and three. And in fact  it's got the 
identity matrix in there, right? It's, it's got zeros above and below the p ivots, and the 
pivots are one, so it's, so it's got a -- so notice the two by two identity matrix that's 
sitting in the pivot rows and pivot columns. it's I in the p ivot rows and columns. It's 
got zero rows below. 

Those are always ind icating that orig ina l rows were, were combinations of other 
rows. 

So we really only had two rows there. 

And now it a lso -- so there's the identity. 

Now it's also got its free columns. 

And, they're cleaned up as much as possib le. 

Actually, actually it's now so cleaned up that the specia l solutions, I can read off --
you remember I went through the steps of computing this -- doing back 
substitution? Let me, let me, instead of that system, let me take this improved 
system. So I'm going to use these numbers, right. In these equations, what did I do? 
I d ivided this equation by two and, oh yeah and  I had subtracted two of this, which 
knocked out this guy and made that a minus sign. Is that what -- I've now written 
Rx equa ls zero. Now I guess I'm hoping everybody in this room understands the 
solutions to the origina l A x equa ls zero, the midway, halfway, U x equa ls zero, and 
the final R x equals zero are a ll the same. Because going from one of those to 
another one I didn't mess up. I just multip lied equations and subtracted  from other 
equations, which I'm allowed to do. 

OK. But my point is that now if I do this free variables and back substitution, it's 
just, the numbers are there. 

When I let x -- so in this guy, I let x2 be one and x4 be zero. 

I, I guess, what I seeing here? Let me, let me sort of separate this out here. I'm 
seeing in the p ivot, in the pivot columns, if I, if I put the p ivot columns here, I'm 
seeing those. 

And I'm -- in the free columns I'm seeing -- what I seeing in the free columns? A 
two, zero in that first free column,  the x2 column, and a minus two, two in the fourth 
column, the other free column. 

And the row of zeros below, which of course have no -- that equation is zero equals 
zero. That's satisfied. 

Here's my point. That when I do back substitution, these numbers are exactly what 
shows up -- oh, their signs get switched. 

I was going to say those numbers, two, minus two, zero, two, can I just circle the --
this is the free part of the matrix. 

This is the identity part. This is the free part, maybe I'll call it F. This, of course, I call 
I, because it's the identity. 

The free part is a, I mean, I'm just doing back substitution. And those free numbers 
will show up, w ith a minus sign, because they pop onto the other side of the 
equation -- so I see minus two, zero, and I see two, minus two. 

So that wasn't mag ic. It had to happen. 

Let me, show you clearly why it happened. OK, so that's -- this is what I'm 
interested in here. 

And now let me, let me just, like, do it, do it for -- let's suppose we've, we've got to 
-- let's suppose we've got this system already in, in rref form. So my matrix R is --
what does it look like? OK, and I'll -- let me pretend that the pivot columns come 
first and then whatever's in the free columns. And there might be some zero rows 
below. There's a typica l -- a pretty typ ica l reduced row echelon form. 

You see what's typ ical. It's got -- this is r by r. 

This is r pivot rows. This is r pivot columns. 

And here are n-r free columns. OK. 

Tell me what are the special solutions? What are the -- what's x? If I want to solve R 
x equa ls zero -- in fact, let me -- I'm rea lly going to, do the whole -- since these --
this is now block matrices, I might as well do all of the specia l solutions at once. So I 
want to solve R x equa ls zero, and I'll have some specia l solutions. 

Let me, actually -- can I do them all at once? I'm going to create a null space matrix, 
OK. A matrix. 

Its, its, its columns are the specia l -- the columns are the special solutions. This is, 
I'm making it sound harder, it's going to be tota lly easy. 

N will be this null space matrix. 

I want R N  to be the zero matrix. 

These columns of N are supposed to multipl- to get multiplied by R and give zero 
columns. So what N will do the job? Let me put -- I'm going to put the identity  in the 
free variable part and then minus F will show up in the p ivot variables, just the way 
it d id in that example. 

There we had the identity and F. 

Here -- in the specia l solution. 

So these columns are -- there's the matrix of special solutions. 

And actually, there -- so there's a Matlab command or a teaching code command, 
NULL -- N equa l, so this is the -- produces the null basis, the null space matrix, NULL 
of A, and there it is. 

And how does that command actually work? It uses Matlab to compute R, then it 
picks out the pivot variab les, the free variables, puts, puts ones and zeros in for the 
free variables, and cop ies out the pivot variables. It, it does back substitution, but 
back substitution for this system is totally simple. 

What is this system? R x equa ls zero. 

So this is R is I F, and x is the p ivot variables and the free variab les, and it's 
supposed to give zero. 

So what does that mean? That means that the p ivot variab les plus F times the free 
variables g ive zero. 

So let me put F times the free variables on the other side. I get minus F times the 
free variables. 

There's my, equation, as simp le as it can be. 

That's what back substitution comes to when I've reduced and reduced and reduced 
this system to the, to  the best form, OK. And, then if the free variables, I make this 
special choice of the identity, then the pivot variables are minus F. 

OK, can I do, another examp le? Could you do another example? Can I -- let me just 
take another matrix and, and let's go through this algorithm once more, OK. 

Here we go. Here's a blackboard for another matrix, OK. So I'll call the matrix A 
again, but let me make it -- yeah, how big shall we make it this time? Why don't I do 
this? Just for the heck of it. Let me take the transpose of this A and see what 
happens to that. 

Two four six eight and three six eight ten. 

Before we do the calculations, tell me what's coming? How many p ivot variab les do 
you expect here? How many columns are going  to have pivots? How many -- we 
have three columns in that matrix, but are we going to, are we going to have three 
pivots? No, because this third columns is the sum of the first two columns. 

I'm totally expecting,  tota lly expecting that these will be pivot columns -- because 
they're independent, but that this third guy, the third column, which is dependent on 
the first two, is going to be a free column. Elimination better d iscover that. And 
elimination w ill a lso stra ighten out the rows, dependent rows and some independent 
rows. What's the, what's the row  reduced echelon form  for this? Let's just do it, OK. 
So, so that's the first pivot. 

Two times that away from that g ives me a  row of zeros. 

Two times that away from that g ives me a zero  two two. 

And two times that away from that g ives me a zero four four. 

OK, first column is stra ight. First variable is a p ivot variable. No problem. 

On to the second column. I look at the second p ivot, it's a zero. I look below it.


There's a two. OK, I do a row exchange.


So this zero is now there. I now have a perfectly good pivot, and I use it. OK, and I

subtract two of that row away from this row. All right if I do it like that? I've got to

the form U now. This was my A.


Now there's my U. I can see now -- I have to stop, right? I would go on to the third

column. I should have tried.


I quit, but without trying. I shouldn't have done that.


On to the third column, look at the pivot position. It's got a zero in it. Look below, all

zeros.


Now I'm entitled to stop, OK.


So the rank  is two aga in. What about the null space? How many specia l solutions are

there this time? How many specia l solutions for this matrix? I've got -- and which are

the free variables and which are the pivot variab les and so on? P ivot columns, I've

got two pivot columns, and that's no accident.


The number of pivot columns for a matrix A, that's a great fact, that the number of

pivot columns for A and A transpose are the same. And then I have a free column.


There's a free column. One free column, because the count is three minus two.


Three minus two gives me one free column.


OK, so now let me solve, what's in the null space.


OK, so how do I -- let's see. These vectors have length three. They only have three

components. I'm making too much space for the, to write x. x has just got three

components, and what are they? I'm looking for the null space.


OK, so how do I start? I g ive the free variable some convenient value. And what's

that? I set it to one. I set the free variable to one.


If I set the free variab le to zero and solve for the p ivot variables, I'll get all zeros: no

progress.


But by setting the free variable to one -- you see w- my two equations now are --

my equations are x1+ 2x2+ 3 x3 is zero, that's my first equation.


And my second equation is now 2x2+2x3 equa ls zero.


And, OK. So if x3 is one, then x2 is minus one. And if x3 is one and x2 is minus one,

then maybe x1 is minus one.


And actually I go back to check now. I don't, like -- I d id a quick ca lculation

menta lly.


Can I menta lly do a quick check? That matrix, that solution x says that minus this 
column minus this column p lus this one is the zero column. And it  is. 

Minus that minus that p lus that is zero. 

So that's in the null space. And now you can tell me what else is in the null space. 
What's, what's the whole null space now? I multiply by C, right. The whole null space 
is a line. 

So that's the description. You know, if I ask you on a homework or a quiz or the fina l 
what -- give me, describe, tell me the null space, find the null space of this matrix, 
you can take those steps. And that's the answer I'm looking for. And I'm looking for 
that C too, because that's telling me that you're remembering that it's a whole space 
and not just one vector. 

Later I w ill ask you  for a basis for the null space. 

Then I just want this vector. But if I ask for the whole null space, then there's the 
whole line through that vector. 

OK, now one more natural thing to do with this example, right, is keep going to the 
reduced matrix, R. So can I push onwards to R? That should be quick, but let's just 
practice. 

Let me keep going to R. OK, so what do I do here? I subtract -- I clear out above the 
pivot, so I subtract that from  that,  that's one zero one is left, right? When I 
subtracted this row  from this it produced a zero above this pivot. And now I want 
that pivot to be a one. So for the R matrix, I'll d ivide this equation by two, and of 
course these zero, zeros are great, they don't change. 

There's R. That's R. 

You see what R is? You see the identity matrix sitting up here? You see the free part 
F, the F part here? And you see the zeros below. 

This is I F zero zero. And what's the x? The x has the identity -- well, it's only a 
sing le number one, but it's the  identity matrix in the free, in the free part. And what 
does it have in the pivot variab les? What d id back substitution give? It gave minus 
these guys. 

You see that what this is is any multip le of -- this is the identity there, and this is 
minus F here. 

This is our null space matrix N  for this. 

Our, our null space matrix is the guy whose columns are the specia l solutions. So 
their free variables have the special values one and, p ivot variab les have minus F. 

So do you see, though, how the minus F just automatically shows up in the special 
solutions. 

That's it rea lly. I don't think there's anything more I can say about A x equa ls zero. 

There's more I can say about A x equa l b, but that'll be on Friday. OK, so that's, 
that's the null space. Thanks.
