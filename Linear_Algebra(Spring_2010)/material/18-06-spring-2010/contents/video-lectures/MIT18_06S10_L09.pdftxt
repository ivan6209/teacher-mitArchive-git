18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2010 
Transcript – Lecture 9 

OK, this is linear a lgebra lecture nine. 

And this is a key lecture, this is where we get these ideas of  linear independence,

when a bunch of vectors are independent -- or dependent, that's the opposite.


The space they span. A basis for a subspace or a basis for a vector space, that's a

centra l idea. And then the d imension of that subspace.


So this is the day that those words get assigned clear meanings. And emphasize that

we talk about a bunch of vectors being independent.


Wouldn't ta lk about a matrix being independent.


A bunch of vectors being independent.


A bunch of vectors spanning a space.


A bunch of vectors being a basis.


And the dimension is some number.


OK, so what are the definitions? Can I beg in with a fact, a highly important fact,

that, I d idn't call d irectly attention to earlier.


Suppose I have a matrix and  I look at Ax equals zero.


Suppose the matrix has a lot of columns, so that n  is bigger than m. So I'm looking

at n equations -- I mean, sorry, m equations, a sma ll number of equations m, and

more unknowns.


I have more unknowns than equations.


Let me write that down. More unknowns than equations.


More unknown x-s than equations.


Then the conclusion is that there's something in the null space of A, other than just

the zero vector.


The conclusion is there are some non-zero x-s such that Ax is zero. There are some 
special solutions. And why? We know why. I mean, it sort of  like seems like a 
reasonable thing, more unknowns than equations, then  it seems reasonable that we 
can solve them. 

But we have a, a clear algorithm which starts w ith a system and does elimination, 
gets the thing into an echelon form with some p ivots and pivot columns, and possib ly 
some free columns that don't have pivots. 

And the point is here there will be some free columns. 

The reason, so the reason is there must -- there will be free variables, at least one. 
That's the reason. 

That we now have this -- a complete, algorithm, a complete systematic way to say, 
OK, we take the system Ax equa ls zero, we row  reduce, we identify the free 
variables, and, since there are n variab les and at most m pivots, there will be some 
free variables, at least one, at least n-m in fact, left over. 

And those variables I can assign non-zero values to. 

I don't have to set those to zero. 

I can take them to be one or whatever I like, and then I can solve for the p ivot 
variables. 

So then it gives me a solution to Ax equals zero. 

And it's a solution that isn't all zeros. 

So, that's an important point that we'll use now  in this lecture. So now I want to say 
what does it mean for a bunch of vectors to be independent. 

OK. So this is like the background that we know. Now  I want to speak about 
independence. OK. 

Let's see. I can give you the abstract definition, and I w ill, but I would also like to 
give you the direct meaning. So  the question is, when vectors x1, x2 up to --
Suppose I have n vectors are independent  if. 

Now I have to g ive you -- or linearly independent -- I'll often just say and write 
independent for short. 

OK. I'll give you the full definition. These are just vectors  in some vector space. I can 
take combinations of them. The question is, do any comb inations give zero? If some 
combination of those vectors g ives the zero vector, other than the combination of a ll 
zeros, then they're dependent. 

They're independent if no comb ination g ives the zero vector -- and then I have, I'll 
have to put in an except the zero combination. So what do I mean by that? No 
combination g ives the zero vector. 

Any combination c1 x1+c2 x2 p lus, plus cn xn is not zero except for the zero 
combination. This is when a ll the c-s, a ll the c-s are zero. Then of course. 

That combination -- I know I'll get zero. 

But the question is, does any other combination give zero? If not, then the vectors 
are independent. If some other combination does g ive zero, the vectors are 
dependent. 

OK. Let's just take examp les. 

Suppose I'm  in, say, in two dimensional space. 

OK. I give you -- I'd like to first take an examp le -- let me take an example where I 
have a vector and twice that vector. So that's two vectors, V and 2V. Are those 
dependent or independent? Those are dependent for sure, right, because there's one 
vector is twice the other. 

One vector is tw ice as long as the other, so if the word dependent means anything, 
these should be dependent. 

And they are. And in fact, I would take two of the first -- so here's, here  is a vector V 
and the other guy is a vector 2V, that's my -- so there's a vector V1 and my next 
vector V2 is 2V1. Of course those are dependent, because two of these first vectors 
minus the second vector is zero. That's a combination of these two vectors that g ives 
the zero vector. 

OK, that was clear. Suppose, suppose I have a vector -- here's another examp le. 

It's easy examp le. Suppose I have a vector and the other guy is the zero vector. 
Suppose I have a vector V1 and V2 is the zero vector. Then are those vectors 
dependent or independent? They're dependent again. 

You could say, well, this guy is zero times that one. This one is some comb ination of 
those. But let me write it the other way. Let me say -- what combination, how many 
V1s and how many V2s sha ll I take to get the zero vector? If, if V1 is like the vector 
two one and V2 is the zero vector, zero zero, then I would like to show that some 
combination of those g ives the zero vector. 

What shall I take? How many V1s shall I take? Zero of them. Yeah, no,  take no V1s. 

But how many V2s? Six. 

OK. Or five. 

Then -- in other words, the point is if the zero vector's in there, if the zero -- if one 
of these vectors is the zero vector, independence is dead, right? If one of those 
vectors is the zero vector then I could always take th- include that one and none of 
the others, and I would get the zero answer, and I would show dependence. 

OK. Now, let me, let me finally draw an example where they w ill be independent. 

Suppose that's V1 and that's V2. 

Those are surely independent, right? Any comb ination of V1 and V2, will not be zero 
except, the zero comb ination. So those would be independent. 

But now let me, let me stick in a third vector, V3. Independent or dependent now, 
those three vectors? So now n is three here. 

I'm in two dimensional space, whatever, I'm in the plane. 

I have three vectors that I didn't draw so carefully. 

I d idn't even tell you what exactly they were. 

But what's this answer on dependent or independent? Dependent. How do I know 
those are dependent? How do I know that some comb ination of V1, V2, and V3 gives 
me the zero vector? I know because of that. 

That's the key fact that tells me that three vectors  in the plane have to be 
dependent. Why's that? What's the connection between the dependence of these 
three vectors and that fact? OK. 

So here's the connection. I take the matrix A that has V1 in its first column, V2 in its 
second column, V3 in its third column. So it's got three columns. 

And V1 -- I don't know, that looks like about two one to me. V2  looks  like  it might be 
one two. V3 looks like it might be maybe two, maybe two and a half, minus one. 

OK. Those are my three vectors, and  I put them in the columns of A. 

Now that matrix A is two by three. 

It fits this pattern, that where we know we've got extra variables, we know we have 
some free variables, we know that there's some combination -- and let me instead of 
x-s,  let me ca ll them c1, c2, and c3 -- that gives the zero vector. 

Sorry that my little bit of art got  in the way. 

Do you see the point? When I have a matrix, I'm interested in whether its columns 
are dependent or independent. The columns are dependent if there is something in 
the null space. The columns are dependent because this, this thing in the null space 
says that c1 of that plus c2 of that p lus c3 of this is zero. So  in other words, I can go 
out some V1, out some more V2, back on V3, and end up zero. OK. 

So let -- here I've g ive the general, abstract definition, but let me repeat that 
definition -- this is like repeat -- let me call them Vs now. 

V1 up to Vn are the columns of a matrix A. 

In other words, this is telling me that if I'm in m dimensional space, like two 
dimensional space in the example, I can answer the dependence- independence 
question directly by putting those vectors in the columns of a matrix. They are 
independent if the null space of A, of A, is what? If I have a bunch of columns in a 
matrix, I'm looking at their combinations, but that's just A times the vector of c-s. 
And these columns w ill be independent if the null space of A is the zero vector. 

They are dependent if there's something else in there. 

If there's something else in the null space, if A times c gives the zero vector for some 
non-zero vector c in the null space. Then they're dependent, because that's telling 
me a comb ination of the columns gives the zero column. I think you're with be, 
because we've seen, like, lecture after lecture, we're looking at the comb inations of 
the columns and asking, do we get zero or don't we? And now we're giving the 
officia l name, dependent if we do, independent  if we don't. 

So I could express this in other words now. 

I could say the rank -- what's the rank in this independent case? The rank r of the, of 
the matrix, in the case of independent columns,  is? So the columns are independent. 

So how many pivot columns have I got. 

All n. All the columns would be pivot columns, because free columns are telling me 
that they're a combination of earlier columns. So this would be the case where the 
rank is n. This would be the case where the rank is sma ller than n. So in this case 
the rank is n and the null space of A is only the zero vector. 

And no free variab les. No free variables. 

And this is the case yes free variab les. 

If you'll allow me to stretch the English language that far. 

That's the case where we have, a combination that g ives the zero column. I'm often 
interested in the case when my vectors are popped into a matrix. 

So the, the definition over there of independence d idn't talk about any matrix. The 
vectors didn't have to be vectors in N d imensional space. And I want to give you 
some examples of vectors that aren't what you think of immed iately as vectors. But 
most of the time, this is -- the vectors we think of are columns. 

And we can put them in a matrix. 

And then independence or dependence comes back to the null space. OK. 

So that's the idea of independence. 

Can I just, yeah, let me go on to spanning a space. What does it mean for a bunch of 
vectors to span a space? Well, actua lly, we've seen it a lready. You remember, if we 
had a columns in a matrix, we took a ll their combinations and that gave us the 
column space. 

Those vectors that we started with span that column space. 

So spanning a space means -- so let me move that important stuff right up. OK. 

So vectors -- let me call them, say, V1 up to -- call you some d ifferent letter, say Vl -
- span a space, a subspace, or just a vector space I could say, span a space means, 
means the space consists of all combinations of those vectors. That's exactly what 
we did with the column space. So now I could say in shorthand the columns of a 
matrix span the column space. 

So you remember it's a bunch of vectors that have this property that they span a 
space, and actually if I give you a bunch of vectors and say -- OK, let S be the space 
that they span, in other words let S contain all their combinations, that space S w ill 
be the smallest space w ith those vectors in it, right? Because any space w ith those 
vectors in it must have a ll the comb inations of those vectors in it. 

And if I stop there, then I've got the smallest space, and that's the space that they 
span. 

OK. So I'm just -- rather than, need ing to say, take a ll linear combinations and put 
them in a space, I'm compressing that into the word span. Stra ightforward. OK. So if 
I think of a, of the column space of a matrix. 

I've got their -- so I start with the columns. 

I take all their comb inations. That g ives me the columns space. They span the 
column space. 

Now are they independent? Maybe yes, maybe no. 

It depends on the particular columns that went  into that matrix. But obviously I'm 
highly interested in a set of vectors that spans a space and is independent. That's, 
that means like I've got the right number of vectors. If I didn't have a ll of them, I 
wouldn't have my whole space. If I had more than that, they probably wouldn't --
they wouldn't be independent. 

So, like, basis -- and that's the word that's coming -- is just right. So here let me put 
what that word means. A basis for a vector space is, is a, is a sequence of vectors --
sha ll I call them V1, V2, up to let me say Vd now, I'll stop w ith that letters -- that 
has two properties. 

I've got enough vectors and not too many. 

It's a natura l idea of a basis. So a basis is a bunch of vectors in the space and it's a 
so it's a sequence of vectors with two properties, with two properties. 

One, they are independent. And two -- you know what's coming? -- they span the 
space. 

OK. Let me take -- so time for examp les, of course. So I'm asking you now to put 
definition one, the definition of independence, together with definition two, and let's 
look at examp les, because this is -- this combination means the set I've -- of vectors 
I have is just right, and the -- so that this idea of a basis will be central. I'll a lways 
be asking you now for a basis. Whenever I look at a subspace, if I ask you for -- if 
you give me a basis for that subspace, you've told me what it is. You've told me 
everything I need to know about that subspace. 

Those -- I take their combinations and I know that I need a ll the combinations. OK. 

Examples. OK, so examp les of a basis. 

Let me start w ith two d imensiona l space. Suppose the space -- say example. 

The space is, oh, let's make it R^3. Rea l three d imensional space. G ive me one

basis.


One basis  is? So I want some vectors, because if I ask you for a basis, I'm asking

you  for vectors, a  little list of vectors.


And it should be just right. So what would be a basis for three dimensional space?

Well, the first basis that comes to mind, why don't we write that down.


The first basis that comes to mind is this vector, this vector, and this vector.


OK. That's one basis.


Not the only basis, that's going to be my point.


But let's just see -- yes,  that's a basis.


Are, are those vectors independent? So that's the like the x, y, z axes, so if those are

not independent, we're  in troub le. Certainly, they are.


Take a combination c1 of this vector p lus c2 of this vector p lus c3 of that vector and

try to make it give the zero vector.


What are the c-s? If c1 of that plus c2 of that p lus c3 of that gives me 0 0 0, then

the c-s are a ll -- 0, right. So that's the test for independence. In the language of

matrices, which was under that board, I could make those the columns of a matrix.

Well, it would be the identity matrix. Then I would ask, what's the null space of the

identity matrix? And you would say it's only the zero vector.


And I would say, fine, then the columns are independent. The only thing -- the 
identity times a vector giving zero, the only vector that does that is zero. OK. 

Now that's not the only basis. Far from it.


Tell me another basis, a second basis, another basis. So, g ive me -- well, I'll just

start it out. One one two.


Two two  five. Suppose I stopped there. Has that little bunch of vectors got the

properties that I'm asking for in a basis for R^3? We're looking  for a basis for R^3.


Are they independent, those two column vectors? Yes. Do they span R^3? No. Our

feeling is no.


Our feeling is no. Our feeling is that there're some vectors in R3 that are not

combinations of those.


OK. So suppose I add in -- I need another vector then, because these two don't span

the space. OK.


Now it would be foolish for me to put in three three seven, right, as the third vector. 
That would be a goof. 

Because that, if I put in three three seven, those vectors would be dependent, right? 
If I put in three three seven, it would be the sum of those two, it would lie in the 
same plane as those. 

It wouldn't be independent. My attempt to create a basis would be dead. But if I take 
-- so what vector can I take? I can take any vector that's not in that plane. Let me 
try -- I hope that 3 3 8 would do  it. At least it's not the sum of those two vectors. 
But I believe that's a basis. 

And what's the test then,  for that to be a basis? Because I just p icked those 
numbers, and if I had p icked, 5 7 -14 how would we know do we have a basis or 
don't we? You would put them in the columns of a matrix, and you would do 
elimination, row  reduction -- and you would see do you get any free variables or are 
all the columns pivot columns. Well now actually we have a square -- the matrix 
would be three by three. 

So, what's the test on the matrix then? The matrix -- so in this case, when my space 
is R^3 and I have three vectors, my matrix is square and what I asking about that 
matrix in order for those columns to be a basis? So in this -- for R^n, if I have -- n 
vectors give a basis if the n by n matrix w ith those columns, w ith those columns, is 
what? What's the requirement on that matrix? Invertib le, right, right. The matrix 
should be invertible. For a square matrix, that's the, that's the perfect answer. 

Is invertible. So that's when, that's when the space is the whole space R^n. 

Let me, let me be sure you're with me here. 

Let me remove that. Are those two vectors a basis for any space at a ll? Is there a 
vector space that those really are a basis for, those, that pa ir of vectors, this guy 
and this 1, 1 1 2 and 2 2 5? Is there a space for which that's a basis? Sure. They're 
independent, so they satisfy the first requirement, so what space shall I take for 
them to be a basis of? What spaces w ill they be a basis for? The one they span. Their 
combinations. 

It's a p lane, right? It'll be a plane inside R^3. So if I take this vector 1 1 2, say it 
goes there, and this vector 2 2 5, say it goes there, those are a basis for -- because 
they span a p lane. And  they're a basis for the p lane, because they're independent. 

If I stick in some third guy, like 3 3 7, which is in the p lane -- suppose I put in, try to 
put in 3 3 7, then the three vectors would still span the p lane, but they wouldn't be a 
basis anymore because they're not independent anymore. OK. 

So, we're looking at the question of -- aga in, the case w ith independent columns is 
the case where the column vectors span the column space. 

They're independent, so they're a basis for the column space. OK. 

So now there's one bit of intuition. 

Let me go back to a ll of R^n. So I -- where I put 3 3 8. 

OK. The first message is that the basis  is not unique, right. There's zillions of bases. 
I take any invertib le three by three matrix, its columns are a basis for R^3. The 

column space is R^3, and if those, if that matrix is invertib le, those columns are 
independent, I've got a basis for R^3. 

So there're many, many bases. 

But there is something in common  for a ll those bases. 

There's something that this basis shares with that basis and every other basis for 
R^3. And what's that? Well, you saw it coming, because when I stopped here and 
asked if that was a basis for R^3, you sa id no. 

And I know that you sa id no because you knew  there weren't enough vectors there. 
And the great fact is that there're many, many bases, but -- let me put in somebody 
else, just for variety. 

There are many, many bases, but they a ll have the same number of vectors. If we're 
talking about the space R^3, then that number of vectors is three. 

If we're talking about the space R^n,  then that number of vectors is n. If we're 
talking about some other space, the column space of some matrix, or the null space 
of some matrix, or some other space that we haven't even thought of, then that still 
is true that every basis -- that there're lots of bases but every basis has the same 
number of vectors. Let me write that great fact down. Every basis -- we're given a 
space. G iven a space. 

R^3 or R^n or some other column space of a matrix or the null space of a matrix or 
some other vector space. Then the great fact is that every basis for this, for the 
space has the same number of vectors. 

If one basis has six vectors, then every other basis has six vectors. So that number 
six is telling me like it's telling me how big is the space. 

It's telling me how many vectors do I have to have to have a basis. And of course 
we're seeing  it this way. That number six, if we had seven vectors, then we've got 
too many. 

If we have five vectors we haven't got enough. 

Sixes are like just right for whatever space that  is. 

And what do we ca ll that number? That number is -- now I'm ready for the last 
definition today. 

It's the dimension of that space. 

So every basis for a space has the same number of vectors in it. Not the same 
vectors, a ll sorts of bases -- but the same number of vectors is always the same, and 
that number is the d imension. This is definitiona l. 

This number is the d imension of the space. 

OK. OK. 

Let's do some examples. Because now we've got definitions. Let me repeat the four 
things, the four words that have now got defined. 

Independence, that  looks at combinations not being zero. Spanning, that looks at a ll 
the combinations. Basis, that's the one that combines independence and spanning. 

And now we've got the idea of the d imension of a space. 

It's the number of vectors in any basis, because all bases have the same number. 
OK. 

Let's take examples. Suppose I take, my space is -- examples now -- space  is the, 
say, the column space of this matrix. 

Let me write down a matrix. 1 1 1, 2 1 2, and I'll -- just to make it clear, I'll take the 
sum there, 3 2 3, and let me take the sum of all -- oh, let me put in one -- yeah, I'll 
put in one one one aga in. 

OK. So that's four vectors. 

OK, do they span the column space of that matrix? Let me repeat, do they span the 
column space of that matrix? Yes. 

By definition, that's what the column space -- where it comes from. Are they a basis 
for the column space? Are they  independent? No, they're not independent. There's 
something in that null space. Maybe we can -- so let's  look at the null space of the 
matrix. Tell me a vector that's in the null space of that matrix. So I'm looking for 
some vector that combines those columns and produces the zero column. 

Or in other words, I'm looking for solutions to A X equa ls zero. So  tell me a vector in 
the null space. Maybe -- well, this was, this column was that one plus that one, so 
maybe if I have one of those and minus one of those that would be a vector in the 
null space. 

So, you've a lready told me now, are those vectors  independent, the answer is --
those column vectors, the answer is -- no. 

Right? They're not independent. 

Because -- you knew they weren't independent. Anyway, minus one of this minus 
one of this p lus one of this zero of that is the zero vector. OK. 

OK, so  they're not independent. They span, but they're not independent. Tell me a 
basis for that column space. What's a basis for the column space? These are all the 
questions that the homework asks,  the quizzes ask, the final exam will ask. Find a 
basis for the column space of this matrix. OK. 

Now there's many answers, but give me the most natural answer. Columns one and 
two. 

Columns one and two. That's the natura l answer. 

Those are the pivot columns, because, I mean, we s- we beg in systematically. We 
look at the first column, it's OK. We can put that in the basis. 

We look at the second column, it's OK. 

We can put that in the basis. The third column we can't put in the basis. The fourth 
column we can't, aga in. So the rank of the matrix is -- what's the rank of our matrix? 
Two. 

Two. And, and now that rank is also -- we a lso have another word. We, we have a 
great theorem here. The rank of A, that rank r, is the number of pivot columns and 
it's a lso -- well, so now please use my new word. 

This, it's the number two, of course, two  is the rank of my matrix, it's the number of 
pivot columns, those pivot columns form a basis, of course, so what's two? It's the 
dimension. 

The rank of A, the number of pivot columns, is the dimension of the column space. 
Of course, you say. It had to be. 

Right. But just watch, look for one moment at the, the language, the way the English 
words get involved here. 

I take the rank of a matrix, the rank of a matrix. 

It's a number of columns and it's the dimension of -- not the dimension of the 
matrix, that's what I want to say. 

It's the dimension of a space, a subspace, the column space. 

Do you see, I don't take the dimension of A. 

That's not what I want. I'm looking  for the dimension of the column space of A. If 
you use those words right, it shows you've got the idea right. 

Similarly here. I don't talk about the rank of a subspace. It's a matrix that has a 
rank. 

I talk about the rank of a matrix. 

And the beauty is that these definitions just merge so that the rank of a matrix is the 
dimension of  its column space. And in this example it's two. And then the further 
question is, what's a basis? And the first two columns are a basis. Tell me another 
basis. Another basis for the columns space. 

You see I just keep hammering away. 

I apolog ize, but it's, I have to be sure you have the idea of basis. Tell me another 
basis for the column space. Well, you could take columns one and three. That would 
be a basis for the column space. Or columns two and three would be a basis. Or 
columns two and four. 

Or tell me another basis that's not made out of those columns at all? So -- I guess 
I'm giving you infinitely many possib ilities, so I can't expect a unanimous answer 
here. I'll tell you -- but let's look at another basis, though. 

I'll just -- because it's only one out of z illions, I'm going to put it down and I'm going

to erase  it.


Another basis for the column space would be -- let's see.


I'll put in some things that are not there.


Say, oh well, just to make it -- my  life easy, 2 2 2. That's in the column space.


And, that was sort of obvious. Let me take the sum of those, say 6 4 6. Or the sum

of all of the columns, 7 5 7, why not.


That's in the column space. Those are independent and I've got the number right,

I've got two.


Actually, this is a key point. If you know the d imension of the space you're working

with, and we know that this column -- we know  that the dimension, DIM, the

dimension of the column space is two. If you know the d imension, then -- and we

have a couple of vectors that are  independent,  they'll automatically be a basis.


If we've got the number of vectors right, two vectors in this case, then if they're

independent, they can't help but span the space.


Because if they d idn't span the space, there'd be a  third guy to help span the space,

but it couldn't be independent.


So, it just has to be independent if we've got the numbers right. And they span.


OK. Very good.


So you got the dimension of a space.


So this was another basis that I just  invented.


OK. Now, now I get to ask about the null space. What's the d imension of the null

space? So we, we got a great fact there, the dimension of the column space  is the

rank.


Now I want to ask you about the null space. That's the other part of the  lecture, and

it'll go on to the next lecture. OK. So we know the dimension of the column space is

two, the rank. What about the null space? This is a vector in the null space.


Are there other vectors in the null space? Yes or no? Yes.


So this isn't a basis because it's doesn't span, right? There's more  in the null space

than we've got so  far. I need another vector at least.


So tell me another vector in the null space.


Well, the natural choice, the choice you natura lly think of is I'm going on to the

fourth column, I'm letting that free variable be a one, and that free variab le be a

zero, and I'm asking is that fourth column a combination of my pivot columns? Yes,

it is.


And it's -- that w ill do. So what I've written there are actua lly the two special

solutions, right? I took the two free variables, free and free.


I gave them the values 1 0 or 0 1.


I figured out the rest. So do you see, let me just say it in words. This vector, these

vectors in the null space are telling me, they're telling me the combinations of the

columns that give zero. They're telling me in what way the, the columns are

dependent. That's what the null space  is doing. Have I got enough now? And what's

the null space now? We have to think about the null space. These are two vectors in

the null space. They're independent. Are they a basis for the null space? What's the

dimension of the null space? You see that those questions just keep coming up all

the time. Are they a basis for the null space? You can tell me the answer even

though we haven't written out a proof of that.


Can you? Yes or no? Do these two specia l solutions form a basis for the null space?

In other words, does the null space consist of all comb inations of those two guys?

Yes or no? Yes. Yes. The null space is two d imensional. The null space, the dimension

of the null space, is the number of free variables. So the d imension of the null space

is the number of free variables.


And at the last second, give me the formula.


This is then the key formula that we know.


How many free variab les are there in terms of R , the rank, m -- the number of rows,

n, the number of columns? What do we get? We have n columns, r of them are p ivot

columns, so n-r is the number of free columns, free variables.


And now it's the d imension of the null space.


OK. That's great. That's the key spaces, their bases, and their d imensions. Thanks.
