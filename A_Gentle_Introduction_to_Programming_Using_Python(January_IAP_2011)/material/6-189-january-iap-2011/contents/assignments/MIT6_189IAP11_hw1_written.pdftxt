Name & Recitation  Section:

Due Wednesday,  Jan  5  at  2:10  PM  in  34-101.  Please  print  out  your  code  ﬁles  (homework  1.py,  rps.py, 
loops.py,  and  any  code  you  wrote  for  optional  problems),  staple  them  to  the  back  of  these  exercises,  and  turn 
them  in  at  the  beginning  of Wednesday’s  lecture. 

Exercise  1.9  –  Variable  Names 

The  Python  interpreter  has  strict  rules  for  variable  names.  Which  of  the  following  are  legal  Python  names?  If  the 
name  is  not  legal,  state  the  reason. 

1.  and 

2.  and 

3.  var 

4.  var1 

5.  1var 

6.  my-name 

7.  your  name 

8.  COLOR

Exercise  1.10  –  Types


It  is  important  that  we  know  the  type  of  the  values  stored  in  a  variable  so  that  we  can  use  the  correct  operators 
(as  we  have  already  seen!).  Python  automatically  infers  the  type  from  the  value  you  assign  to  the  variable.  Write 
down  the  type  of  the  values  stored  in  each  of  the  variables  below.  Pay  special  attention  to  punctuation:  values  are 
not  always  the  type  they  seem! 

1.  a  =  False 

2.  b  =  3.7 

3.  c  =  ’Alex’ 

4.  d = 7 

5.  e  =  ’True’ 

6.  f  =  17 

7.  g  =  ’17’ 

8.  h  =  True 

9.  i  =  ’3.14159’ 

To  verify  your  answers,  you  can  use  the  interactive  Python  shell,  but  ﬁrst  try  to  do  the  exercise  without  help. 

>>>  x  =  100 
>>>  type(x) 
<type  ’int’> 
>>>

Exercise  1.11  –  Natural  Language  Processing 

Consider  the  following  sentence: 
Alice  saw  the  boy  on  the  hill  with  the  telescope. 

1.  Draw  a  sketch  of  what’s  described  in  this  sentence. 

2.  Draw  a  diﬀerent  sketch  that  could  also  be  described  by  this  sentence. 

3.  Write  the  sentence  in  two  diﬀerent  ways,  that  clariﬁes  the  meaning  of  each  of  your  sketches,  next  to  your 
above  sketches  (hint:  rewrite  the  sentence  using  extra  words,  commas,  etc). 

4.  The  ambiguity  illustrated  by  this  sentence  is  known  as  “prepositional  phrase  attachment.”  Think  about  this 
as you  continue  to  learn how  to program,  and  consider how programming  languages  are designed  to  avoid  the 
ambiguity  illustrated  by  this  example! 

Exercise  1.12  –  Boolean  operators 

Boolean  operators  can  seem  tricky  at  ﬁrst,  and  it  takes  practice  to  evaluate  them  correctly.  Write  the  value  (True 
or  False)  produced  by  each  expession  below,  using  the  assigned  values  of  the  variables  a,  b,  and  c.  Try  to  do  this 
without  using  your  interpreter,  but  you  should  check  yourself  when  you  think  you’ve  got  it.  Hint:  Work  from  the 
inside  out,  starting  with  the  inner-most  expressions,  like  in  arithmetic. 

a  =  False 
b  =  True 
c  =  False 

1.  b  and  c 

2.  b  or  c 

3.  not  a  and  b 

4.  (a  and  b)  or  not  c 

3 

5.  not  b  and  not  (a  or  c) 

Exercise  1.13  –  Conditionals 

The  purpose  of  this  exercise  is  to  understand  conditionals.  Tiberius  is  looking  for  his  dream  job,  but  has  some 
restrictions.  He  loves  California  and  would  take  a  job  there  if  it  paid  over  40,000  a  year.  He  hates  Massachusetts 
and  demands  at  least  100,000  to  work  there.  Any  other  place  he’s  content  to  work  for  60,000  a  year,  unless  he  can 
work  in  space  in  which  case  he  would  work  for  free.  The  following  code  shows  his  basic  strategy  for  evaluating  a 
job  oﬀer. 

pay  =  _____ 
location  =  _____ 

if  location  ==  "U.S.S.  Enterprise":" 
print  "So  long,  suckers!  I’ll  take  it!" 
elif  location  ==  "Massachusetts": 
if  pay  <  100000: 
print  "No  way" 
else: 
print  "I’ll  take  it!" 
elif  location  ==  "California"  and  pay  >  40000: 
print  "I’ll  take  it!" 
elif  pay  >  60000: 
print  "I’ll  take  it!" 
else: 
print  "No  thanks,  I  can  find  something  better." 

For  each  of  the  following  job  oﬀers,  write  down  the  output  that  would  be  generated.  Do  this  without  running  the 
code.  It  is  an  important  skill  to  be  able  to  understand  what  a  piece  of  code  does  without  running  it. 

1.	 location  =  "Massachusetts"

pay  =  50000


2.	 location  =  "Iowa"

pay  =  50000


3.	 location  =  "California"

pay  =  50000


4.	 location  =  "U.S.S.  Enterprise"

pay  =  1


5.	 location  =  "California"

pay  =  25000

Exercise  1.14  –  Understanding  loops 

For  each  of  the  following  fragments  of  code,  write  what  the  output  would  be.  Again,  do  this  without  running  the 
code  (although  feel  free  to  check  yourself  when  you’re  done). 

1.	 num  =  10 
while	 num  >  3:

print  num

num  =  num  - 1


2.	 divisor  =  2 
for	 i  in  range(0,  10,  2): 
print  i/divisor 

3.	 num  =  10 
while  True: 
if  num  <  7: 
break 
print  num 
num  -=  1 

4.	 count  =  0 
for	 letter  in  ’Snow!’: 
print  ’Letter  #’,  count,  ’is’,  letter 
count  +=  1

Exercise  1.15  –  Buggy  loop  (aka  Find  The  Bug!) 

Consider  the  following  program  that  Ben  Bitdiddle  handed  in  to  the  course  staﬀ  (again,  try  to  do  this  exercise 
without  running  the  code  in  IDLE!): 

n  =  10 
i  =  10 

while  i  >  0: 
print  i 
if  i  %  2  ==  0: 
i = i /  2 
else: 
i = i + 1 

What  do  you  think  this  code  is  doing?  Without  comments  it  is  hard  to  guess  what  Ben’s  intention  was  (*cough* 
this  is why  the  staﬀ  loves  to  look  at  commented  code!!),  so  read  through  it  and make  a  sensible  guess  as  to what  it 
is  doing.  There’s  a  lot  of  mistakes  in  the  code  so  your  guess  is  as  good  as  ours! 

1.  Draw  a  table  that  shows  the  value  of  the  variables  n  and  i  during  the  execution  of  the  program.  Your  table 
should  contain  two  columns  (one  for  each  variable)  and  one  row  for  each  iteration.  For  each  row  in  the  table, 
write  down  the  values  of  the  variables  as  they  would  be  at  the  line  containing  the  print  statement. 

2.  Ben  made  a  lot  of  mistakes.  State  what  you  think  Ben  was  trying  to  do  and  suggest  one  or  more  ways  he 
could ﬁx his code (there’s a few good answers for this depending on what you think the code should be doing).
