What  to  turn  in 

Turn  in  a  printout  of  your  code  exercises,  stapled  to  your  answers  to  the written  exercises,  at  2 PM  on Wednesday, 
January  5th. 

Exercise  1.0  –  Installing  Python 

Follow  the  instructions  on  installing Python  and  IDLE  on your  own  computer  on  the Materials page  of  the  course 
website,  in  the  Handouts  section.  Be  sure  to  install  Python  2.6.x.  Ask  an  LA  for  help  if  you  run  into  any 
trouble.  Before  continuing,  play  around with  the Python  shell  a  bit  and  explore  how  you  can  use  it  as  a  calculator. 

Exercise  1.1  –  Hello,  world! 

Recall  that  a  program  is  just  a  set  of  instructions  for  the  computer  to  execute.  Let’s  start  with  a  basic  command: 

print  x:  Prints  the  value  of  the  expression  x,  followed  by  a  new  line. 

Create a new program called hello  world.py.  You will use this ﬁle to write your very ﬁrst  ‘Hello, world!’  program, 
as  well  as  your  answers  for  the  rest  of  the  exercises  for  today.  How  to  create  a  program  ﬁle: 

1 

1.  Open  a  new  window  by  choosing  New  Window  from  the  File  menu. 

2.  Save  the ﬁle as hello  world.py.  Do NOT  skip  the  ‘.py’ portion of  the ﬁle name  - otherwise,  you will  lose out 
on  syntax  highlighting! 

3.  Start  every  program  with  a  bank  of  comments,  with  a  comment  line  for  your  name,  your  recitation  section, 
the  name  of  your  ﬁle,  and  today’s  date.  Recall  that  a  comment  line  begins  with  a  ‘#’  (pound)  symbol. 

You  can now write your very own Hello, world!  program.  This  is  the ﬁrst program  that most programmers write  in 
a  new  programming  language.  In  Python,  Hello  world!  is  a  very  simple  program  to  write.  Do  this  now...  it  should 
be  only  be  one  line! 

When  you  are  done,  save  your  work  and  run  it.  Your  code  should  look  similar  to  this: 

2 

To  run  your  program,  chose  Run  Module  from  the  Run  menu  (or  just  hit  F5  on Windows/Linux,  or  fn-F5  on  a 
Mac).  When  you  run  the  code,  your  shell  should  look  similar  to  this: 

When  you  run  your  code,  it  ﬁrst  prints  the  line  >>>  =====  RESTART  =====,  then  runs  your  code  underneath  that 
line. 

Exercise  1.2  –  Printing 

From  the  course  website,  download  the  homework  1.py  template.  Remember  to  put  your  name  and  section  at  the 
top.  If  you  don’t  we’ll  be  highly  grumpy. 

Write  a  program  using  print  that,  when  run,  prints  out  a  tic-tac-toe  board.  Remember  to  save  your  program 
regularly,  to  keep  from  losing  your  work!  The  purpose  of  this  exercise  is  to  make  sure  you  understand  how  to 
write  programs  using  your  computing  environment; many  students  in  introductory  courses  experience  trouble with 
assignments  not  because  they  have  trouble  with  the material,  but  because  of  some  weird  environment  quirk.

Exercise  1.3  –  Variables 

Recall  that  variables  are  containers  for  storing  information.  For  example, 

Program  Text: 

a  =  ‘‘Hello,  world!’’ 
print  a 

Output: 

Hello,  world! 

The  =  sign  is  an  assignment  operator  which  tells  the  interpreter  to  assign  the  value  ‘‘Hello,  world!’’  to  the 
variable  a. 

Program  Text: 

a  =  ‘‘Hello,  world!’’ 
a  =  ‘‘and  goodbye...’’ 
print  a 

Output: 

and  goodbye... 

Taking  this  second  example,  the  value  of  a  after  executing  the  ﬁrst  line  above  is  ‘‘Hello,  world!’’.  But,  after 
executing  the  second  line,  the  value  of  a  changes  to  ‘‘and  goodbye...’’.  Since  we  ask  the  program  to  print  out 
a  only  after  the  second  assignment  statement,  that  is  the  value  that  gets  printed.  If  you  wanted  to  save  the  values 
of  both  strings,  you  should  change  the  second  variable  to  another  valid  variable  name,  such  as  b. 

Variables  are  useful  because  they  can  cut  down  on  the  amount  of  code  you  have  to write.  In  homework  1.py, write 
a  program  that  prints  out  the  tic-tac-toe  board  from  exercise  1.2,  but  which  uses  variables  to  cut  down  on  the 
amount  of  typing  you  have  to  do.  Hint  - how  many  diﬀerent  variables  should  you  need? 

Exercise  1.4  –  Operators/Order  of  Operation 

Python  has  the  ability  to  be  used  as  a  cheap,  5-dollar  calculator.  In  particular,  it  supports  basic  mathematical 
operators  +,  -,  *,  /  as  well  as  the  power  operator  (**)  and  the  modulus  operator  (%).

Program  Text: 

x = 5 + 7 
print  x 
y  =  x  +  10 
print  y 

Output: 

12 
22 

Note  that we  can  use  variables  in  the  deﬁnition  of  other  variables!  Mathematical  operators  only work  on  numbers­
ints  or  ﬂoats.  Statements  such  as  ’Hi’  +  5  or  ’5’  +  7  will  not  work. 

Part  I:  Input  the  following  sets  of  equations,  and  note  the  diﬀerence  between  int  arithmetic  and  ﬂoat  arithmetic. 
You  can  do  this  just  in  your  interpreter  (you  don’t  need  to  turn  anything  in  for  this  part),  but  pay  attention  to  the 
output!

Part  II: In homework  1.py,  transcribe the  following equations  into Python (without simplifying!), preserving order 
of  operation  with  parenthesis  as  needed.  Save  each  as  the  value  of  a  variable,  and  then  print  the  variable.

5.  6	 mod  4  - If  you  aren’t  familiar with modular  arithmetic,  it  is  pretty  straightforward- the modulus  operator, 
in  the  expression  x  mod  y ,  gives  the  remainder  when  x  is  divided  by  y .  Try  a  couple  modular  expressions 
until  you  get  the  hang  of  it. 

Part  III:  In  homework  1.py,  use  order  of  operation  mathematics  to  create  two  equations  that  look  the  same  (ie, 
have  the  same  numbers)  but  evaluate  to  diﬀerent  values  (due  to  parenthesization).  Save  each  as  the  value  of  a 
variable,  then  print  the  variables. 

Exercise  1.5  –  User  input 

Do  this  exercise  in  homework  1.py.  In  this  exercise,  we  will  ask  the  user  for  his/her  ﬁrst  and  last  name,  and 
date  of  birth,  and  print  them  out  formatted.  Recall  that  you  can  get  input  from  the  user  using  the  command 
raw  input(‘‘text’’),  as  shown  in  lecture. 

5 

Note:  There are  two  functions  to get user  input.  The ﬁrst, raw  input,  turns whatever  the user  inputs  into a  string 
automatically.  The  second,  input,  preserves  type.  So,  if  the  user  inputs  an  int,  or  a  ﬂoat,  you  will  get  an  int  or 
a  ﬂoat  (rather  than  a  string).  Be  careful  though- you  still  want  to  use  raw  input  if  you  want  a  string  back,  or 
otherwise the user will have to put quotes around their answer.  Use raw  input here - it’s good for string processing, 
like  this  problem.  input  will  come  in  handy  when  using  user  input  to  compute math  - like  in  Exercise  1.8. 

Here  is  an  example  of  what  this  program  should  do: 

Output: 

Enter  your  first  name:  Chuck 
Enter  your  last  name:  Norris 
Enter  your  date  of  birth: 
Month?  March 
Day?  10 
Year?  1940 
Chuck  Norris  was  born  on  March  10,  1940. 

To  print  a  string  and  a  number  in  one  line,  you  just  need  to  separate  the  arguments  with  a  comma  (this  works  for 
any  two  types  within  a  print  statement).  The  comma  adds  a  space  between  the  two  arguments.  For  example,  the 
lines: 

mo  =  ’October’ 
day  =  ’20’ 
year  =  ’1977’ 
print  mo,  day,  year 

will  have  the  output 

October  20  1977 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPTIONAL:  Now,  for  something  completely  diﬀerent...  a  discussion  on  how  to  print  strings,  most  prettily... 

Note  that  none  of  the  commas  are  in  this  output!  To  do  that  you  want  something  like  this: 

print  mo,  day+’,’,  year. 

The  +  sign  concatenates  two  strings,  but  can  only  be  used  on  two  strings.  Using  it  on  a  number  and  a  string  will 
cause  an  error  (because  it  is  ambiguous  as  to  what  you  want  the  program  to  do!) 

That’s  why  it’s  a  great  idea  to  use  raw  input  for  this  problem;  if  you  use  input  you’d  have  to  convert  the  int  to  a 
string.  We’ll  cover  this  more  in-depth  on  Thursday,  when  we  get  to  strings,  but  you  may  want  to  play  with  string 
concatenation  operations  now  to  get  everything  to  look  its  prettiest. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At  this  point, we  suggest  completing written  exercises  1.9  - 1.11  to  cement  your  understanding  of Monday’s  topics. 
Exercises  1.6-1.8  and  1.12-1.15  cover  Tuesday’s  topics.

Exercise  1.6  –  New  Operators 

Open  up  IDLE  and  play  around  with  the  new  operators  showed  today  in  class.  Make  sure  that  you  understand 
how  to  use  them  and  what  they  are  used  for!  The  operators  ==,  !=,  <,  >,  <=,  >=  are  called  relation  operators. 
They  work  on  all  types,  not  just  numbers,  and  return  a  Boolean  (True/False)  value.  Remember,  if  you  are  using 
Booleans,  to  capitalize  True  and  False!  Here’s  an  example  shell  session;  try  other  examples  you  can  think  of. 

>>>  5  >=  7 
False 
>>>  ’abc’  !=  ’def’ 
True 
>>>  x  =  ’abc’ 
>>>  x  ==  ’abc’ 
True 

This  next  example  is  strange!  Try  to  understand  what’s  going  on  here,  and  ask  if  you’re  confused. 

>>>  a  =  True 
>>>  b  =  (5  <  7) 
>>>  a  ==  b 
True 

Next,  the  operators  +=,  -=,  *=,  /=  change  the  value  of  a  stored  variable  in  a  quicker  way.  In  the  following 
example,  we  add  6  to  a  variable  in  two  diﬀerent  ways;  note  that  we  get  the  same  result!  Try  using  all  of  these 
operators  in  your  interpreter  window  before moving  on. 

>>>  x  =  5 
>>>  x  =  x  +  6 
>>>  print  x 
11 
>>>  y  =  5 
>>>  y  +=  6 
>>>  print  y 
11 

We  strongly  suggest  you  ﬁnish  al l  the  written  exercises  now,  before  continuing  on  with  the  next  code  problem.

Exercise  1.7  –  Rock,  Paper,  Scissors 

In  this  exercise,  you  are  going  to  practice  using  conditionals  (if,  elif,  else).  You will write  a  small  program  that will 
determine  the  result  of  a  rock,  paper,  scissors  game,  given Player  1  and Player  2’s  choices.  Your  program will  print 
out  the  result.  Here  are  the  rules  of  the  game: 

Paper
beats rock

Scissors
beats paper

Rock
beats scissors

1.  First  create  a  truth  table  for  all  the  possible  choices  for  player  1  and  2,  and  the  outcome  of  the  game.  This 
will  help  you  ﬁgure  out  how  to  code  the  game!

Player  1 
Rock

Player  2

2.  Create  a  new  ﬁle	 rps.py  that  will  generate  the  outcome  of  the  rock,  scissors,  paper  game.  The  program 
should  ask  the  user  for  input  and  display  the  answer  as  follows: 

Player  1?  rock

Player  2?  scissors

Player  1  wins.


The  only  valid  inputs  are  rock,  paper,  and  scissors.  If  the  user  enters  anything  else,  your  program  should 
output  “This  is  not  a  valid  ob ject  selection”.  Use  the  truth  table  you  created  to  help  with  creating  the 
conditions  for  your  if  statement(s).  Read  on  to  the  next  page  before  starting... 

8 

Note  If  you  have  a  long  condition  in  your  if  statement,  and  you  want  to  split  it  into  multiple  lines,  you  can 
either  enclose  the  entire  expression  in  parenthesis,  e.g. 

if	 (player1  ==  ’rock’  and

player2  ==  ’scissors’):

print  ’Player  1  wins.’


Or,  you  can use  the backslash  symbol  to  indicate  to Python  that  the next  line  is  still part  of  the previous  line 
of  code,  e.g. 

if	 player1  ==  ’rock’  and\

player2  ==  ’scissors’:

print  ’Player  1  wins.’


Use  whichever  form  you  feel  comfortable  using.  When  you  are  done  coding  and  testing!,  print  a  copy  of  the 
ﬁle  and  turn  it  in.  Make  sure  your  name  and  section  number  is  in  the  comment  section  of  your  program. 

Exercise  1.8  –  For  &  While  Loops 

Create  a  new  ﬁle  called  loops.py  and  use  it  for  all  parts  of  this  exercise.  Remember  the  diﬀerence  between  input 
and  raw  input?  If  not,  look  at  Exercise  1.5  again. 

Be  sure  to  test  your  code  for  each  part  before moving  on  to  the  next  part. 

1.  Using  a  for  loop,  write  a  program  that  prints  out  the  decimal  equivalents  of  1/2, 1/3, 1/4, . . . , 1/10. 

2.  Write a program using a while loop that asks the user for a number, and prints a countdown from that number 
to  zero.  What  should  your  program  do  if  the  user  inputs  a  negative  number?  As  a  programmer,  you  should 
always  consider  “edge  conditions”  like  these  when  you  program!  (Another  way  to  put  it- always  assume  the 
users  of  your  program  will  be  trying  to  ﬁnd  a  way  to  break  it!  If  you  don’t  include  a  condition  that  catches 
negative  numbers,  what  will  your  program  do?) 

3.  Write  a  program  using  a  for  loop  that  calculates  exponentials.  Your  program  should  ask  the  user  for  a  base 
base  and  an  exponent  exp,  and  calculate  baseexp . 

4.  Write  a  program  using  a while  loop  that  asks  the  user  to  enter  a  number  that  is  divisible  by  2.  Give  the  user 
a witty message  if  they  enter  something  that  is not divisible by  2- and make  them  enter  a  new  number.  Don’t 
let  them  stop  until  they  enter  an  even  number!  Print  a  congratulatory  message  when  they  *ﬁnally*  get  it 
right. 

When  you  are  done,  print  a  copy  of  the  ﬁle  and  turn  it  in.  Make  sure  your  name  and  section  number  is  in  the 
comment  section  of  your  program.

Exercise  OPT.1  –  Zeller’s  Algorithm 

OPTIONAL!- Some  problem  sets  will  have  optional  exercises  at  the  end.  Feel  free  to  work  on  these  problems 
if  you  have  time  at  the  end  of  the  assignment,  but  you  certainly  don’t  have  to  do  them.  However,  you  will  get 
excellent  practice  in  Python,  and  we  will  give  you  feedback  on  any  optional  work  you  turn  in. 

Zeller’s  algorithm  computes  the  day  of  the  week  on  which  a  given  date  will  fall  (or  fell).  In  this  exercise,  you  will 
write  a  program  to  run  Zeller’s  algorithm  on  a  speciﬁc  date.  You  will  need  to  create  a  new  ﬁle  for  this  program, 
zellers.py.  The  program  should  use  the  algorithm  outlined  below  to  compute  the  day  of  the  week  on  which  the 
user’s  birthday  fell  in  the  year  you  were  born  and  print  the  result  to  the  screen. 

Start  with  the  program  in  Exercise  1.5,  but  ask  for  the  month  as  a  number  between  1-12  where  March  is  1  and 
February  is  12.  If  born  in  Jan  or  Feb,  enter  previous  year  (see  the  notes  below).  In  the  end,  print  out  the  name  of 
the  user  and  on  what  they  of  the  week  they  were  born. 

Zeller’s  algorithm  is  deﬁned  as  follows: 

Let  A,  B,  C,  D  denote  integer  variables  that  have  the  following  values: 

A  =  the  month  of  the  year,  with  March  having  the  value  1,  April  the

value  2,  .  .  .,  December  the  value  10,  and  January  and  February  being

counted  as  months  11  and  12  of  the  preceding  year  (in  which

case,subtract  1  from  C)

B  =  the  day  of  the  month  (1,  2,  3,  .  .  .  ,  30,  31)

C  =  the  year  of  the  century  (e.g.  C  =  89  for  the  year  1989)

D  =  the  century  (e.g.  D  =  19  for  the  year  1989)


Note:  if  the month  is  January  or February,  then  the  preceding  year  is  used  for  computation.  This  is  because  there 
was  a  period  in  history  when March  1st,  not  January  1st,  was  the  beginning  of  the  year. 

Let W, X, Y, Z, R also denote integer variables.  Compute their values in the following order using integer arithmetic: 

W  =  (13*A  - 1)  /  5 
X = C / 4 
Y = D / 4 
Z  =  W  +  X  +  Y  +  B  +  C  - 2*D 
R  =  the  remainder  when  Z  is  divided  by  7 

The  value  of  R  is  the  day  of  the  week,  where  0  represents  Sunday,  1  is  Monday,  . 
If 
.,  6  is  Saturday. 
. 
the  computed  value  of  R  is  a  negative  number,  add  7  to  get  a  non  negative  number  between  0  and  6  (you 
don’t  need  to  do  this  in  the  code).  Print  out  R.  You  can  check  to  be  sure  your  code  is  working  by  looking  at 
http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/. 

Run  some  test  cases- try  today’s  date,  your  birth  date,  and  whatever  else  interests  you! 

Feel  free  to  submit  your  zellers.py  code  if  you  wish,  we’ll  take  a  look  at  it  if  you  do.

Exercise  OPT.2  –  Secret  Messages 

OPTIONAL!  This  exercise  is  tricky!  Be  sure  to  ask  the  LAs  for  help  if  you  need  them! 

The  goal  of  this  exercise  is  to  write  a  cyclic  cipher  to  encrypt  messages.  This  type  of  cipher  was  used  by  Julius 
Caesar  to  communicate  with  his  generals.  It  is  very  simple  to  generate  but  it  can  actually  be  easily  broken  and 
does  not  provide  the  security  one  would  hope  for. 

The  key  idea behind  the Caesar  cipher  is  to  replace  each  letter by  a  letter  some ﬁxed number  of positions down  the 
alphabet.  For  example,  if  we  want  to  create  a  cipher  shifting  by  3,  you  will  get  the  following  mapping: 

Plain: 
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
Cipher:  DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC 

To  be  able  to  generate  the  cipher  above, we  need  to  understand  a  little  bit  about  how  text  is  represented  inside  the 
computer.  Each  character  has  a  numerical  value  and  one  of  the  standard  encodings  is  ASCII  (American  Standard 
Code  for  Information  Interchange).  It  is  a  mapping  between  the  numerical  value  and  the  character  graphic.  For 
example,  the ASCII  value  of  ’A’  is  65  and  the ASCII  value  of  ’a’  is  97.  To  convert between  the ASCII  code  and  the 
character  value  in  Python,  you  can  use  the  following  code: 

letter  =  ’a’ 

#  converts  a  letter  to  ascii  code 
ascii_code  =  ord(letter) 

#  converts  ascii  code  to  a  letter 
letter_res  =  chr(ascii_code) 

print  ascii_code,  letter_res 

Start  small.  Do  not  try  to  implement  the  entire  program  at  once.  Break  the  program  into  parts  as  follows: 

1.  Create  a  ﬁle  called  cipher.py.  Start  your  program  by  asking  the  user  for  a  phrase  to  encode  and  the  shift 
value.  Then  begin  the  structure  of  your  program  by  entering  in  this  loop  (we’ll  build  on  it more  in  a  bit): 

encoded_phrase  =  ’’ 

for  c  in  phrase:

encoded_phrase  =  encoded_phrase  +  c


What  does  this  loop  do?  Make  sure  you  understand  what  the  code  does  before  moving  on! 

2.  Now  modify  the  program  above  to  replace  all  the  alphabetic  characters  with  ’x’.  For  example: 

Enter  sentence  to  encrypt:  Mayday!  Mayday!

Enter  shift  value:  4

The  encoded  phrase  is:  Xxxxxx!  Xxxxxx!


We  are  going  to  apply  the  cipher  only  to  the  alphabetic  characters  and  we  will  ignore  the  others. 

11 

3.  Now  modify  your  code,  so  that  it  produces  the  encoded  string  using  the  cyclic  cipher  with  the  shift  value 
entered  by  the  user.  Let’s  see  how  one  might  do  a  cyclic  shift.  Let’s  say  we  have  the  sequence: 

012345 

If  we  use  a  shift  value  of  4  and  just  shift  all  the  numbers,  the  result  will  be:

We want  the  values  of  the  numbers  to  remain  between  0  and  5.  To  do  this we will  use  the modulus  operator. 
The  expression  x%y  will  return  a  number  in  the  range  0  to  y-1  inclusive,  e.g.  4%6  =  4,  6%6  =  0,  7%6  =1. 
Thus  the  result  of  the  operation  will  be:

Hint:  Note  that  the  ASCII  value  of  ’A’  is  65  and  ’a’  is  97,  not  0.  So  you  will  have  to  think  how  to  use 
the  modulus  operator  to  achieve  the  desired  result.  Apply  the  cipher  separately  to  the  upper  and  lower  case 
letters. 
Here  is  what  you  program  should  output: 

Enter  sentence  to  encrypt:  Mayday!  Mayday!

Enter  shift  value:  4

The  encoded  phrase  is:  Qechec!  Qechec!


When you  are done,  print  a  copy  of  the ﬁle  and  turn  it  in.  Make  sure  your name  and  section number  is  in  the 
comment  section  of  your  program.
