6.189: Getting Started with Python and Idle

Getting Started: Python and IDLE 

Introduction

This handout will cover how to set up Python and introduce you to IDLE, the Python development environment we will 
be using throughout this course. 

Setting up Python

On Athena* / Linux

Python should be set up correctly on the Linux athena* machines. Type 'idle' at the command prompt to ensure that 
everything is working correctly. This should start up the Python development environment IDLE. 

On your own machine

If you are working on your own machine, you will probably need to install Python. We will be using the standard 
Python software, available here. You should download and install version 2.6.x, NOT 2.7.x or 3.x All MIT Course 6 
classes currently use a version of Python 2.6. 

Windows: 
Go to the website and download the windows MSI installer for either x86 or x86-64, depending on which version of 
Windows you are running. 

Mac OS X: 
Download and install the Mac Installer disk image from the site. 

Other Linux: 
Check which version of Python you have by running  
python -V  
at a terminal. If you have a newer version of Python already installed - eg Python 2.7.x or 3.1.x, you can set Python 
2.6 as the default by following the instructions listed here. Otherwise, you should be able to do one of the following 
options: 

sudo apt-get install python2.6

if you don't already have Python 2.6 installed; if you do, run 

Athena* is MIT's UNIX-based computing environment. OCW does not provide access to it.

f
ompressed tarballs. If you're having problems, please ask an LA for assistance. 
c

arning: On the Python homepage, the latest version available for download is actually 3.0. Do not install this! This

ersion is not backwards compatible with the code that you'll be writing in this course (for example, you have to type 
v
rint("test") instead of print "test"). Instead, be sure to download the version listed above.

DLE is the standard Python development environment Its name is an acronym of "Integrated DeveLopment

nvironment". It works well on both Unix and Windows platforms. 

t has a Python shell window, which gives you access to the Python interactive mode. It also has a file editor that lets

hen you start up IDLE, a window with an interactive Python shell will pop up: 

6.189: Getting Started with Python and Idle

You can type Python code directly into this shell, at the '>>>' prompt. Whenever you enter a complete code fragment, 
it will be executed. For instance, typing: 

 

>>> print "hello 
world" 

 

and pressing ENTER, will cause the following to be displayed: 

hello 
world 

 

Try typing an underscore ( _ ). Can you see it? On some operating systems, the bottoms of hanging letters such as 'g' 
or 'y', as well as underscorces, cannot be seen in IDLE. If this is the case for you, go to Options -> Configure IDLE, and 
change the size of the default font to 9 or 11. This will fix the problem!  
 
IDLE can also be used as a calculator: 

>>> 4+4 
8 
>>> 8**3 
512 

 

Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulo (%) and power (**) operators are built into the 
Python language. This means you can use them right away. If you want to use a square root in your calculation, you 

6.189: Getting Started with Python and Idle

can either raise something to the power of 0.5 or you can import the math module. Do not worry about what it means 
right now, we will cover this later during the course. Below are two examples of square root calculation: 

>>> 16**0.5 
4.0 
>>> import math 
>>> math.sqrt(16) 
4.0 

 

The math module allows you to do a number of useful operations: 

>>> math.log(16, 2) 
4.0 
>>> math.cos( 0 ) 
1.0 

 

Note that you only need to execute the import command once after you start IDLE; however you will need to execute 
it agin if you restart the shell, as restarting resets everything back to how it was when you opened IDLE. Don't worry 
too much about this right now; we'll cover it more in depth soon! 

Exercise

(this is just for practice, solutions will not be graded or collected in class) 
Use IDLE to calculate: 

1.  6+4*10
2.  (6+4)*10 (Compare this to #1, and note that Python uses parentheses just like you would in normal math to 
determine order of operations!)
3.  23.0 to the 5th power
4.  Positive root of the following equation: 
34*x^2 + 68*x - 510  
Recall: 
a*x^2 + b*x + c 
x1 = ( - b + sqrt ( b*b - 4*a*c ) ) / ( 2*a)
