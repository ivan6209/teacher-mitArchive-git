1  Search  Algorithms  (16  points) 

1.1  Games 
The  standard  alpha-beta  algorithm  performs  a  depth-ﬁrst  exploration  (to  a  pre-speciﬁed  depth)  of 
the  game  tree. 

1.  Can  alpha-beta  be  generalized  to  do  a  breadth-ﬁrst  exploration  of  the  game  tree  and  still 
get  the  optimal  answer?  Explain  how  or  why  not.  If  it  can  be  generalized,  indicate  any 
advantages  or  disadvantages  of  using  breadth-ﬁrst  search  in  this  application. 
No.  The  alpha-beta  algorithm  is  an  optimization  on  min-max.  Min-max  inher-
ently needs  to  look  at  the game-tree nodes below  the  current node  (down  to  some 
pre-determined  depth)  in  order  to  assign  a  value  to  that  node.  A  breadth-ﬁrst 
version  of  min-max  does  not  make  much  sense.  Thinking  about  alpha-beta  in-
stead  of  min-max  only  makes  it  worse,  since  the  whole  point  of  alpha-beta  is  to 
use  min-max  values  from  one  of  the  earlier  (left-most)  sub-trees  to  decide  that 
we  do  not  need  to  explore  some  later  (right-most)  subtrees. 
Some  answers  suggested  that  min-max  inherently  needs  to  go  all  the  way  down 
to  the  leaves  of  the  game  tree,  where  the  outcome  of  the  game  is  known.  This 
is  not  true.  Typically  one  picks  some  depth  of  look-ahead  depth  and  searches  to 
that  depth,  using  the  static  evaluator  to  compute  a  score  for  the  board  position 
at  that  depth. 

2.  Can alpha-beta be generalized to do a progressive-deepening exploration of the game tree and 
still  get  the  optimal  answer?  Explain  how  or  why  not.  If  it  can  be  generalized,  indicate  any 
advantages  or  disadvantages  of  using  progressive-deepening  search  in  this  application. 
Yes.  Progressive-deepening  involves  repeated  depth-ﬁrst  searches  to  increasing 
depths.  This  can  be  done  trivially  with  min-max  and  alpha-beta  as  well,  which 
also  involve  picking  a  maximum  depth  of  lookahead  in  the  tree.  PD  does  waste 
some  work,  but  as  we  saw  in  the  notes,  the  extra  work  is  a  small  fraction  of  the 
work  that  you  would  do  anyways,  especially  when  the  branching  factor  is  high, 
as  it  is  in  game  trees.  The  advantage  is  that  in  timed  situations  you  guarantee 
that  you  always  have  a  reasonable  move  available.

1.2  Algorithms 
1.  You  are  faced  with  a  path  search  problem  with  a  very  large  branching  factor,  but  where  the 
answers  always  involve  a  relative  short  sequence  of  actions  (whose  exact  length  is  unknown). 
All  the actions have  the  same  cost.  What  search algorithm would you use  to ﬁnd  the optimal 
answer?  Indicate  under  what  conditions,  if  any,  a  visited  or  expanded  list  would  be  a  good 
idea. 
Progressive  deepening  (PD),  with  no  visited  or  expanded  list  would  probably  be 
the  best  choice.  All  the  costs  are  the  same,  so  breadth-ﬁrst  (BF)  and  PD  both 
guarantee  ﬁnding  the  shortest  path  in  that  situation,  without  the  overhead  of 
uniform-cost  search.  Since  the  branching  factor  is  high,  space  will  be  an  issue, 
which  is  why  we  prefer  PD  over  BF.  If  we  were  to  use  a  visited  list  with  PD, 
the  space  cost  would  be  the  same  as  BF  and  it  would  not  make  sense  to  pay  the 
additional  run-time  cost  of  PD  (repeated  exploration  of  parts  of  the  tree)  if  we 
give  up  the  space  advantage. 

2.  You  are  faced  with  a  path  search  problem  with  a  very  large  branching  factor,  but  where  the 
answers  always  involve  a  relative  short  sequence  of  actions  (whose  exact  length  is  unknown). 
These  actions,  however,  have  widely  varying  costs.  What  search  algorithm  would  you  use  to 
ﬁnd  the  optimal  answer?  Indicate  under  what  conditions,  if  any,  a  visited  or  expanded  list 
would  be  a  good  idea. 
Since we have variable  link costs, we should use Uniform Cost search to guarantee 
the  optimal  answer.  The  fact  that  the  costs  are  highly  variable  is  good,  since  we 
expect  that  we  might  be  able  to  avoid  exploring  sub-trees  with  high  cost.  Note 
that we don’t necessarily have a useful heuristic and  so A* may not be applicable. 
Using an expanded  list would make  sense  if the  search space  involves  lots of  loops, 
which  would  lead  us  to  re-visit  the  same  state  many  times.  However,  since  we 
know  that  there’s  a  relatively  short  path  to  the  goal,  it  might  not  be  worth  the 
extra  space.

2  Constraints  (16  points) 

Consider  assigning  colors  to  a  checkerboard  so  that  squares  that  are  adjacent  vertically  or horizon-
tally  do  not  have  the  same  color.  We  know  that  this  can  be  done with  only  two  colors,  say  red  (R) 
and  black  (B). We  will  limit  our  discussion  to  ﬁve  squares  on  a  3x3  board,  numbered  as  follows: 

1 | 2 | 3 
---------
4 | 5 | 
---------
|
| 

3 = {R, B }

Let’s  look  at  the  CSP  formulation  of  this  problem.  Let  the  squares  be  the  variables  and  the 
colors  be  the  values.  All  the  variables  have  domains  {  R,  B  }. 
1.  If  we  run  full  constraint  propagation  on  the  initial  state,  what  are  the  resulting  domains  of 
the  variables? 
None  of  the  variable  domains  change: 
1 = {R, B } 
2 = {R, B} 
4 = {R, B } 
5 = {R, B} 
2.  Say,  instead,  the  initial  domain  of  variable  5  is  restricted  to  {  B  },  with  the  other  domains 
as  before.  If  we  now  run  full  constraint  propagation,  what  are  the  resulting  domains  of  the 
variables? 
2 = {R} 
1 = {B} 
3 = {B}
4 = {R} 
5 = {B} 
3.  If  in  the  initial  state  (all  variables  have  domains  {  R,  B  }),  we  assign  variable  1  to  R  and  do 
forward  checking,  what  are  the  resulting  domains  of  the  other  variables? 
Forward  checking  is  deﬁned  as  a  single  iteration  of  constraint  propagation  only 
on  those  edges  that  terminate  at  the  variable  whose  value  was  just  set,  and  that 
do  not  originate  from  variables  which  have  already  been  set.  Therefore,  after  we 
set  1 =  R,  forward  checking  aﬀects  the  domains  of  variables  2  and  4  since  they 
are  adjacent  to  variable  1  (and  have  not  yet  been  assigned). 
2 = {B} 
1 = {R} 
3 = {R, B }
5 = {R, B } 
4 = {B} 

Forward  checking  only  does  one  step  of  propagation,  only  to  the  immediate  neighbors  of  the 
assigned  variable.

4. Assume that during backtracking we ﬁrst attempt assigning variables to R and then to B.
Assume, also, that we examine the variables in numerical order, starting with 1. Also, let
the domain of variable 5 be { B }, the other domains are { R, B }. In the following tree,
which shows the space of assignments to the 5 variables we care about, indicate how pure
backtracking (BT) would proceed by placing a check mark next to any assignment that would
be attempted during the search and crossing out the nodes where a constraint test would fail.
Leave unmarked those nodes that would never be explored.

5. If we use backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC) in this same situation, give a list of all
the assignments attempted, in sequence. Use the notation variable = color for assignments,
for example, 1=R.
We must keep track of the variable domains as we search since forward checking
modiﬁes these domains based on the current assignment, and we will need to
restore the domain of earlier search nodes if we have to backtrack to them. We
fail at a node if (1) the current assignments violate some constraint, or (2) if
forward checking after the present assignment causes the domain of some variable
to become empty. The following lists (in order from left to right) each attempted
assignments and the resulting variable domains after forward checking.

1 = R 2 = B 1 = B 2 = R 3 = B 4 = R 5 = B

FAIL

Note that when we fail at 2 = B , since there are no further values to try in the

4

domain  of  variable  2,  we  backtrack  to  the  assignment  of  variable  1.  When  this 
happens,  we  restore  the  domains  from  before  variable  1  was  assigned,  i.e.  the 
ones  listed  above  under  “None”. 

6.  If  we  use  backtracking  with  forward  checking  (BT-FC)  but  with  dynamic  variable  ordering, 
using  the  most-constrained-variable  strategy,  give  a  list  of  all  the  variable  assignments  at-
tempted,  in  sequence.  If  there  is  a  tie  between  variables,  use  the  lowest-numbered  one  ﬁrst. 
Use  the  notation  variable  =  color  for  assignments,  for  example,  1=R. 
Use  of  the  most-constrained-variable  strategy  entails  assigning  the  variable  ﬁrst 
whose  domain  is  smallest.  This  ordering  is  not  only  performed  at  the  start  of  the 
search.  Rather,  it  is  updated  after  each  variable  is  assigned  and  forward  checking 
modiﬁes  the  domains  of  unassigned  variables.  For  this  problem,  variable  5  has 
the  smallest  domain  initially.  After  assigning  variable  5,  the  domains  of  variable 
2  and  4  become  smaller  than  those  of  variables  3  and  5.  Since  variable  2  has  the 
lowest  index,  it  is  assigned  next.  And  so  on,  as  shown  below: 

5 = B  2 = R  1 = B  3 = B  4 = R

3  Constraint  satisfaction  (24  points) 

You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope.  We have m scientists who have each 
submitted a  list of n  telescope observations  they would  like  to make.  An observation  is  speciﬁed by 
a  target,  a  telescope  instrument,  and a  time  slot.  Each  scientist  is working on a diﬀerent pro ject  so 
the  targets  in  each  scientist’s  observations  are  diﬀerent  from  those  of  other  scientists.  There  are  k 
total  time  slots,  and  the  telescope  has  three  instruments,  but  all must  be  aimed  at  the  same  target 
at  the  same  time. 
The  greedy  scientists  cannot  all  be  satisﬁed,  so  we  will  try  to  ﬁnd  a  schedule  that  satisﬁes  the 
following  constraints: 

C1.	 Exactly  two  observations  from  each  scientist’s  list will be made  (the  choice  of  the  two will be 
part  of  the  solution). 

C2.	 At  most  one  observation  per  instrument  per  time  slot  is  scheduled. 

C3.	 The  observations  scheduled  for  a  single  time  slot must  have  the  same  target. 

Note  that  for  some  set  of  requested  observations,  there  may  not  be  any  consistent  schedule,  but

that’s  ﬁne.

Consider  the  following  three  formulations  of  the  problem. 


A.  The  variables  are  the  3k  instrument/time  slots. 

B.  The  variables  are  the m  scientists. 

C.  The  variables  are  the mn  scientists’  requests. 

For  each  formulation,  specify 

1.  The  value  domain  for  the  variables. 

2.  The  size  of  the  domain  for  the  variables  (in  terms  of  k , m, and  n). 

3.  Which  of  the  constraints  are  necessarily  satisﬁed  because  of  the  formulation. 

4.  Whether  the  constraints  can be  speciﬁed as binary  constraints  in  this  formulation.  If  they  can, 
explain  how.  If  not,  provide  a  counterexample.

Formulation  A:  The  variables  are  the  3k  instrument/time  slots. 
1.  Domain:  for  each  instrument/time  slot,  the  set  of  observations  requesting  that  in-
strument  and  time  slot  and  the  value  “empty” 
2.  Size  of  domain:  at  most  m*n+1  per  variable 
3.  Satisﬁed constraints:  C2,  since each variable  (instrument/time) gets at most one value, 
an  observation. 
4.  Binary  constraints?: 

•	 C1  is  not  a  binary  constraint  in  this  formulation.  It  requires  checking  all  the 
variable  assignments  at  once  to  make  sure  that  exactly  two  observations  from 
each  scientist’s  list  are  made. 
•	 C3  is  a  binary  constraint  in  this  formulation.  Place  a  constraint  between  the  3 
variables  with  the  same  time  slot  and  require  that  the  targets  of  the  assigned 
observation  be  equal  if  they  are  both  non-empty. 
Formulation  B:  The  variables  are  the m  scientists. 
1.  Domain:  for each scientist,  the set of all pairs of observations that scientist requested. 
�	 � 
n
,  approximately  n2/2.
2.  Size  of  domain: 
2 
3.  Satisﬁed  constraints:  C1,  since  we  will  guarantee  that  exactly  two  of  the  scientist’s 
observations  are  scheduled. 
4.  Binary  constraints?: 

•	 C2  is  a  binary  constraint  in  this  formulation.  Place  a  constraint  between  every 
pair of variables and require that the  instrument/time slot requests don’t conﬂict. 
•	 C3  is  a  binary  constraint  in  this  formulation.  Place  a  constraint  between  every 
pair  of  variables  and  require  that  the  targets  for  observations with  the  same  time 
slot  don’t  conﬂict. 
Formulation  C:  The  variables  are  the mn  scientists’  requests. 
1.  Domain:  {Granted,  Rejected}
2.  Size  of  domain:  2 
3.  Satisﬁed  constraints:  None 
4.  Binary  constraints?: 

•	 C1  is  not  a  binary  constraint  in  this  formulation.  It  requires  checking  all  the 
variable  assignments  of  Granted  observations  at  once  to  make  sure  that  exactly 
two  observations  from  each  scientist’s  list  are  granted. 
•	 C2  is  a  binary  constraint  in  this  formulation.  Place  a  constraint  between  every 
pair  of  variables  and  require  that  the  instrument/time  slot  requests  don’t  conﬂict 
between  any  two  Granted  requests. 
•	 C3  is  a  binary  constraint  in  this  formulation.  Place  a  constraint  between  every 
pair  of  variables  and  require  that  the  targets  of  the  Granted  observations  with 
the  same  time  slot  don’t  conﬂict.

4  Search  Problem  formulation  (23  points) 

Consider  a Mars  rover  that has  to drive  around  the  surface,  collect  rock  samples,  and  return  to  the 
lander.  We  want  to  construct  a  plan  for  its  exploration. 
•	 It  has  batteries.  The  batteries  can  be  charged  by  stopping  and  unfurling  the  solar  collectors 
(pretend  it’s  always  daylight).  One  hour  of  solar  collection  results  in  one  unit  of  battery 
charge.  The  batteries  can  hold  a  total  of  10  units  of  charge. 
•	 It can drive.  It has a map at 10-meter resolution  indicating how many units of battery charge 
and  how  much  time  (in  hours)  will  be  required  to  reach  a  suitable  rock  in  each  square. 
•	 It  can  pick  up  a  rock.  This  requires  one  unit  of  battery  charge.  The  robot  has  a  map  at 
10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected 
weight  of  rocks  in  that  location.  Assume  only  one  type  of  rock  and  one  size  can  be  found  in 
each  square. 

The  ob jective  for  the  rover  is  to  get  one  of  each  of  10  types  of  rocks,  within  three  days,  while 
minimizing  a  combination  of  their  total weight  and  the  distance  traveled.  You  are  given  a  tradeoﬀ 
parameter  α  that  converts  units  of weight  to  units  of  distance.  The  rover  starts  at  the  lander with 
a  full  battery  and must  return  to  the  lander. 
Here  is  a  list  of  variables  that might  be  used  to  describe  the  rover’s  world: 
•	 types  of  rocks  already  collected 
•	 current  rover  location  (square  on  map) 
•	 current  lander  location  (square  on  map) 
•	 weight  of  rocks  at  current  location  (square  on  map) 
•	 cost  to  traverse  the  current  location  (square  on  map) 
•	 time  since  last  charged 
•	 time  since  departure  from  lander 
•	 current  day 
•	 current  battery  charge  level 
•	 total  battery  capacity 
•	 distance  to  lander 
•	 total  weight  of  currently  collected  rocks 

8 

1.  Use  a  set  of  the  variables  above  to  describe  the  rover’s  state.	 Do  not  include  extraneous 
information. 
•	 types  of  rocks  already  collected 
•	 current  rover  location  (square  on  map) 
•	 time  since  departure  from  lander 
•	 current  battery  charge  level 
•	 total  weight  of  currently  collected  rocks  (optional,  depending  on  your  choice 
of  cost  function) 

2.  Specify  the  goal  test. 
•	 All  types  of  rocks  have  been  collected 
•	 rover  at  lander  location 
•	 time  since  departure  less  than  3  days 

3.  Specify the actions.  Indicate how they modify the state and any preconditions for being used. 

charge  :  precondition:  none;  eﬀects:  increases  battery  voltage  by  1  unit,  increases 
time-since-departure  by  1  hour 
move  :  precondition:  enough  battery  voltage  to  cross  square;  eﬀects:  decreases 
battery  voltage  by  amount  speciﬁed  in  map;  increases  time  by  amount  spec-
iﬁed  in  map;  changes  rover  location 
pick-up-rock  :  precondition:  enough  battery  voltage;  eﬀects:  decreases  battery 
voltage  by  1  unit;  changes  types  of  rocks  already  collected 

4.  Specify  a  function  that  determines  the  cost  of  each  action. 

charge  : 0

move  :  10  meters

pick-up-rock  :  α  *  weight-of-rocks-at-current-location

5.  This  can be  treated as a path  search problem.  We would  like  to ﬁnd a heuristic.  Say whether 
each  of  these possible heuristics would be useful  in ﬁnding  the  optimal path  or,  if not, what’s 
wrong  with  them.  Let  l  be  the  number  of  rocks  already  collected. 
H1:  The  sum  of  the  distances  (in  the map)  from  the  rover  to  the  10 − l  closest  locations  for 
the  missing  types  of  rocks. 
This  heuristic  is  inadmissible. 
H2:  The length of the shortest tour through the 10 − l closest locations for the missing types 
of  rocks. 
This  heuristic  would  take  an  impractical  amount  of  time  to  compute;  and 
while  more  reasonable  than  H1  is  also  inadmissible. 
H3:  The  distance  back  to  the  lander. 
This  heuristic  is  admissible,  but  very  weak.

5  Search  traces  (21  points) 

Consider the graph shown in the ﬁgure below.  We can search it with a variety of diﬀerent algorithms, 
resulting  in  diﬀerent  search  trees.  Each  of  the  trees  (labeled  G1  though  G7)  was  generated  by 
searching  this  graph,  but  with  a  diﬀerent  algorithm.  Assume  that  children  of  a  node  are  visited  in 
alphabetical  order.  Each  tree  shows  all  the  nodes  that  have  been  visited.  Numbers  next  to  nodes 
indicate  the  relevant  “score”  used  by  the  algorithm  for  those  nodes. 
For  each  tree,  indicate  whether  it  was  generated  with 

1.  Depth  ﬁrst  search 

2.  Breadth  ﬁrst  search 

3.  Uniform  cost  search 

4.  A*  search 

5.  Best-ﬁrst  (greedy)  search 

In  all  cases  a  strict  expanded  list  was  used.  Furthermore,  if  you  choose  an  algorithm  that  uses  a 
heuristic  function,  say  whether  we  used 
H1: heuristic  1  =  {h(A) = 3, h(B ) = 6, h(C ) = 4, h(D) = 3} 
H2: heuristic  2  =  {h(A) = 3, h(B ) = 3, h(C ) = 0, h(D) = 2} 
Also,  for  all  algorithms,  say  whether  the  result  was  an  optimal  path  (measured  by  sum  of  link 
costs),  and  if  not,  why  not.  Be  speciﬁc. 
Write  your  answers  in  the  space  provided  below  (not  on  the  ﬁgure). 

11


G1: 1. Algorithm:  Breadth  First  Search 
2.  Heuristic  (if  any):  None 
3.  Did it ﬁnd least-cost path?  If not, why?  No.  Breadth  ﬁrst  search  is  only  guaranteed 
to  ﬁnd  a  path  with  the  shortest  number  of  links;  it  does  not  consider  link  cost  at 
all. 

G2: 1. Algorithm:  Best  First  Search 
2.  Heuristic  (if  any):  H1 
3.  Did  it  ﬁnd  least-cost  path?  If  not,  why? 
No.  Best  ﬁrst  search  is  not  guaranteed  to  ﬁnd  an  optimal  path.  It  takes  the  ﬁrst 
path  to  goal  it  ﬁnds. 

G3: 1. Algorithm:  A* 
2.  Heuristic  (if  any):  H1 
3.  Did it ﬁnd least-cost path?  If not, why?  No.  A* is only guaranteed to ﬁnd an optimal 
path  when  the  heuristic  is  admissible  (or  consistent  with  a  strict  expanded  list). 
H1  is  neither:  the  heuristic  value  for  C  is  not  an  underestimate  of  the  optimal 
cost  to  goal. 

G4: 1. Algorithm:  Best  First  Search 
2.  Heuristic  (if  any):  H2 
3.  Did  it  ﬁnd  least-cost  path?  If  not,  why?  Yes.  Though  best  ﬁrst  search  is  not  guar-
anteed  to  ﬁnd  an  optimal  path,  in  this  case  it  did. 

G5: 1. Algorithm:  Depth  First  Search 
2.  Heuristic  (if  any):  None 
3.  Did  it  ﬁnd  least-cost  path?  If  not,  why?  No.  Depth  ﬁrst  search  is  an  any-path 
search;  it  does  not  consider  link  cost  at  all. 

G6: 1. Algorithm:  A* 
2.  Heuristic  (if  any):  H2 

12 

3.  Did  it  ﬁnd  least-cost  path?  If  not,  why?  Yes.  A*  is  guaranteed  to  ﬁnd  an  optimal 
path  when  the  heuristic  is  admissible  (or  consistent  with  a  strict  expanded  list). 
H2  is  admissible  but  not  consistent,  since  the  link  from  D  to  C  decreases  the 
heuristic  cost  by  2,  which  is  greater  than  the  link  cost  of  1.  Still,  the  optimal 
path  was  found. 

G7: 1. Algorithm:  Uniform  Cost  Search 
2.  Heuristic  (if  any):  None 
3.  Did  it  ﬁnd  least-cost  path?  If  not,  why?  Yes.  Uniform  Cost  is  guaranteed  to  ﬁnd  a 
shortest  path.
