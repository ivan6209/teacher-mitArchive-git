Unit 1: Supply  and  demand 
•	 Lecture  2:  Supply  and  Demand 

I. Supply  and  demand  diagrams:  demand  shows  willingness  of  consumers  to  buy  the  good; 
supply  shows  willingness  of  producers  to  sell;  intersection  is market  equilibrium. 
II. Supply  and  demand  curves  can  shift  when  there  are  shocks  to  the  ability  of  producers  to 
supply;  shocks  in  consumer  tastes;  shocks  to  the  price  of  substitute  goods. 
III. Interventions  in  market  can  lead  to  disequilibrium:  for  example,  imposing  a  minimum 
wage  means  that  more  people  will  want  to  work  than  employers  want  to  hire  at  the 
minimum  wage.  This  creates  unemployment. 

IV. The  cost  of  these  interventions  is  found  in  reduced  eﬃciency  (trades  that  are  not  made); 
there may  be  beneﬁts  in  greater  equity.

	 Lecture  3:  Applying  supply  and  demand 
I. Perfectly  inelastic demand  is characteristic of a good with no  substitutes;  perfectly elastic 
demand  is  a  good  with  perfect  substitutes. 

δQ 
II. Price  elasticity  of  demand  is  deﬁned  � =  Q 
δP  .
P 
III. Perfectly  inelastic  demand  is  � = 0,  perfectly  elastic  demand  is  � = −∞. 
IV. The  elasticity  aﬀects  consumers’  response  to  a  shift  in  price:  if  the  elasticity  is  between  0 
and  -1,  then  ﬁrms  can  raise  revenues  by  raising  the  price  (since  consumers  will  still  buy 
the  good  in  signiﬁcant  quantities);  if  � < −1,  then  raising  the  price  results  in  a  decline  in 
ﬁrm  revenue. 

V. Accurately  estimating  an  elasticity  requires  a  shift  along  the  supply  curve  (e.g.,  a  tax  on 
suppliers). 

Unit 2: Consumer Theory
•	   Lecture 4: Preferences
 
 
I. Introduction  to  preferences  and  utility 
II. 	 We impose three assumptions about consumer preferences:  preferences are complete, tran­
sitive  and  non-satiated. 

and  utility

III. 	 These  yield  four  assumptions  about  utility  curves:  consumers  prefer  higher  indiﬀerence 
curves,  they  are  downward-sloping,  they  never  cross  and  there  is  one  indiﬀerence  curve 
through  every  consumption  bundle.

IV. Utility  function  is a  function  that  transfers bundles of goods  into a  scale of utils;  however, 
it  provides  only  an  ordinal  ranking,  not  a  cardinal  one. 

V. A  general  assumption  employed  is  diminishing  marginal  utility:  consumers  receive  less 
utility  from  each  unit  of  a  good  they  consume. 
VI. M RS  =  M UX  is  the  ratio  of  marginal  utilities;  diminishing  as  you  move  along  the  indif­
M YY 
ference  curve. 

•	 Lecture  5:  Budget  constraints  and  constrained  choice 
I. Budget  constraint  over  two  goods  X  and  Y  is  deﬁned  Y  = ppP  + pmM . 
II. Slope of the budget constraint is deﬁned as marginal rate of transformation:  rate at which 
you  can  transform  one  good  into  the  other  in  the marketplace. 

III. Shifts  in  price  and  income  alter  the  position  and  slope  of  the  budget  constraint. 
IV. The  optimal  bundle  that  a  consumer  can  choose  is  deﬁned  by  the  point  of  tangency 
− py 
between  the  indiﬀerence curve and  the budget  line:  M RS  = − M Ux  = 
px  = M RT .  This
M Uy 
is  equivalent  to  equating  the marginal  cost  and  beneﬁt  of  consuming  each  good. 

V. The above  equation deﬁnes an  interior  solution  (in which  the  consumer  consumes  some of 
each  good);  if  indiﬀerence  curves  are  ﬂat,  there  can  also  be  corner  solutions  in  which  the 
consumer  only  consumes  one  good. 

•	 Lecture  6:  Deriving  demand  curves 
I. We  can  use  the  constrained  optimization  problem  to  derive  the  demand  curve. 
ΔQ

II. This  also  allows  us  to  deﬁne  the  income  elasticity  of  demand:  γ  =  Q 
Δ  Y .

Y 
III. For  most  goods,  the  income  elasticity  is  positive  (normal  goods),  but  some  goods  may 
show  a  consumption  decline  when  income  increases  (inferior  goods). 

IV. An  increase  in  price,  on  the  other  hand,  has  two  eﬀects:  it makes  the  consumer  relatively 
poorer  (income  eﬀect)  and  it  also  makes  this  speciﬁc  good  less  attractive  relative  to  al­
ternatives  (substitution  eﬀect).  The  substitution  eﬀect  can  be  interpreted  as  the  shift  in 
goods  consumed  from  the  original  point  to  the  optimal  point  for  a  budget  constraint  that 
has  the  new  slope,  but  is  tangent  to  the  old  indiﬀerence  curve. 

V. Substitution  eﬀect  is  always  negative,  but  income  eﬀect  can  be  positive. 
VI. Accordingly, the overall eﬀect of a price increase on consumption of a good can be negative 
(for  a  normal  good)  or  positive,  if  the  good  is  inferior  and  the  income  eﬀect  is  larger  than 
the  substitution  eﬀect. 

VII. A  good  with  a  positive  own-price  elasticity  is  known  as  a  Giﬀen  good.

•	 Lecture  7:  Income  /  substitution  eﬀects  and  labor  supply 
I. 	 Income  and  substitution  eﬀects  can  be  used  to  analyze  labor  supply:  leisure  (time  not 
spent  working)  is  a  consumption  good,  and  the  price  of  that  good  is  the  wage,  since  that 
is  the  opportunity  cost  of  time  not  spent  working. 

II. 	 When  the  wage  rate  increases,  this  also  has  both  an  income  eﬀect  and  a  substitution 
eﬀect. 

–	 Income  eﬀect:  each worker  is  now  richer,  and may want  to work  less  (consume more 
leisure). 
–	 Substitution  eﬀect:  returns  to  working  are  higher,  each  worker  may  want  to  work 
more. 
–	 If  the  income  eﬀect  more  than  oﬀsets  the  substitution  eﬀect,  labor  supply  may  go 
down  when  income  increases.
