Unit 5: Market Power
1  Lecture  17:  Oligopoly  Continued  (Chapter  12) 

I.  Cournot Math 
•	 Cournot:  All  ﬁrms  set  quantities  at  the  same  time 
•	 Calculate  residual  demand  for  a  given  ﬁrm  and  solve  its  proﬁt  maximization  problem  to  ﬁnd  its 
best  response  function  to  other  ﬁrms’  output  decisions. 
•	 Solution  is  a  set  of  quantities  (one  for  each  ﬁrm)  that  solves  this  system  of  equations. 
II.  Cooperative  Equilibrium  - Cartels 
•	 Firms  can  form  a  cartel  and  behave  like  a  single  monopolist,  maximizing  total  industry  proﬁts. 
•	 Cartels  are  unusual  because  they  are  fundamentally  unstable  (incentive  to  “cheat”  and  raise  own 
production)  and  because  they  are  illegal  (antitrust  laws). 

III.  Comparing  Equilibria 
•	 In  terms  of  welfare,  usually  Perfect  Competition  >  Oligopoly  > Monopoly 
•	 Quantity  as  an  indicator  of  social  welfare 
•	 DWL  in  welfare  analysis  comes  from  trades  that  aren’t made 
IV.  Many  Firms 
•	 In  Cournot,  as  number  of  ﬁrms → ∞,  Cournot  equilibrium  approaches  competitive  equilibrium 
•	 As  number  of  ﬁrms → 1,  approaches  monopoly 
•	 Markup  over  competitive  price  depends  on  number  of  ﬁrms  and  elasticity  of  demand: 
p − M C 
1 
= − 
p 
n� 

V.  Price  Competition 
•	 Bertrand:  ﬁrms  set  prices  (instead  of  quantities)  at  the  same  time 
•	 Two  ﬁrms may  be  enough  to  remove market  power  (i.e.  restore  competitive  outcome)  if  products 
are  identical 
•	 Recall  proof  from  class  that  identical  Bertrand  duopolists  drive  price  down  to marginal  cost 
•	 Also  recall  the  Stackelberg model where  one  ﬁrm  set  their  quantity  before  the  other  ﬁrm.  In  this 
case,  the  best  response  function  for  the  Stackelberg  leader  takes  into  account  the  fact  that  the 
follower  will  respond  to  the  leader’s  output  decision. 
Unit 6: Topics in Intermediate Microeconomics
2  Lecture  18:  Factor  Markets  (Chapter  15) 

I.  Competitive  Factor Markets 
•	 In  SR  and  in  LR,  demand  for  labor  will  be  its  marginal  revenue  product

· 
M RPL  = M R  M PL


where  MR  is  marginal  revenue  from  additional  unit  of  output  (M R  =  p  if  competitive  output 
market).  These  will  diﬀer  in  LR  and  in  SR  because  M PL  in  LR  will  take  into  account  optimal 
capital  adjustments.

• 

LR  labor  demand  more  elastic  than  SR 

II.  Monopsony 
•	 Monopsony:  single  buyer  in  input  market 
•	 Barriers  to  exit  (from  factor  market)  create  monopsony 
•	 Competitive  ﬁrms  consider  price  of  inputs,  but monopsonist  looks  at  marginal  expenditure. 
d[p(q) · q ] 
dT E (q)
dq 
dq 
•	 Takes  “poisoning  eﬀect”  on  inframarginal  untis  into  account 
•	 Increase  input  usage  if ME<MRP,  decrease  if ME>MRP. 
•	 Price  comes  from  supply  function 
•	 Monopsonists  underhire  at  lower  wages  relative  to  perfect  competition 

M E (q) = 

= 

III.  Application:  Minimum Wage 
•	 Higher minimum  wages  can  restore  competitive  outcome  in  a  monopsonistic market 

3  Lecture  19:  International  Trade 

I.  What  is  International  Trade? 
•	 trade  deﬁcit  =  imports-exports 

II.  Comparative  Advantage  and  Gains  from  Trade 
•	 Diﬀerences  in  opportunity  costs  lead  to  comparative  advantage  in  diﬀerent  goods 
•	 When  countries  have  diﬀerent  comparative  advantages  in  production  of  diﬀerent  goods,  there  are 
potential  gains  from  trade  through  specialization 

III.  Welfare  Implications  from  International  Trade 
•	 In competitive model, opening to trade  increases total welfare but usually at the expense of either 
consumers  or  producers 
•	 Practice  welfare  comparisons  using  the  usual  graphs  for  imports  and  exports 

IV.  Trade  Policy 
•	 Eﬀects  of  tariﬀs  and  quotas 

4  Lecture  20:  Uncertainty  (Chapter  17,  sections  1-3) 

I.  Decision-Making  Under  Uncertainty 
•	 Expected  utility:  probability-weighted  average  of  utility 
·	
· 
EU  = P r(Lose)  U (Lose) + P r(Win)  U (Win)
•	 Diﬀerent  than  utility  of  expected  value,  since  utility  functions  usually  concave  (diminishing  MU 
of  income) 

II.  Extensions 
•	 Concave  utility  (decreasing MU  income) →  risk  averse 

2 

•	 Linear  utility  (constant MU  income) →  risk  neutral 
•	 Convex  utility  (increasing MU  income →  risk  loving 
III.  Applications 
•	 Insurance:  risk  averse people will pay money  to  turn  a  gamble  into  a  certain payoﬀ  since  they  get 
higher  utility  from  certain  income  than  from  a  gamble  with  the  same  expected  value 
•	 Maximum  amount  they’re  willing  to  pay  for  this  is  their  “risk  premium” 
•	 Lottery  behavior  is  a  puzzle  – maybe  risk  averse  at  low  incomes  and  risk  loving  at  high  incomes

Lectures 21 and 22:  Capital Supply and Capital Markets (Chap­
ter  16) 

Lecture  21  - Capital  Markets 

I.  Capital  and  Intertemporal  Choice 
•	 Supply  of  capital  from  household  decisions  about  how  much  to  save  –  increasing  in  interest 
rate 
•	 Demand  for  capital  comes  from  ﬁrms  with  potentially  productive  investments  to make 
•	 Intertemporal  choice  graph  over  consumption  in  period  one  (C1  on  x-axis)  and  in  period  2 
(C2  on  y-axis).  Slope  of  the  BC  is  −(1 + r) 
•	 When  r  changes,  eﬀect  on  savings  depends  on  relative  size  of  IE  and  SE 
II.  Present  Value 
•	 Need  to  translate  all  future  dollars  into  today’s  terms 
•	 For  a  single  payment  of  FV  in  year  t: 

F V 
P V  = 
(1 + r)t 
•	 Value  of  a  perpetuity  –  constant  payment  of  f  every  period  forever: 
P V  = f /r 

•	 Importance  of  compunding 
•

Real  interest  rate  r  is  the  one  we  care  about  –  the  nominal  interest  rate  i  minus  inﬂation  π
r = i − π


Lecture  22  - Capital  Markets  II 

I.  Choices  Over  Time 
•	 Choose  option  with  highest  present  value  when  choosing  between  pro jects  or  investments 
II.  Investment  Decisions 
•	 Net  Present  Value  (NPV)  =  PV  of  revenues  - PV  of  costs 
•	 Rule:  Invest  if  NPV  greater  than  zero 
�	
� 
•	 if  revenues  Rt  in  each  period  and  costs  Ct ,  NPV  of  investment  is: 
Rt  − Ct 
R2  − C2  + . . . + 
R1  − C1  + 
N P V  = (R0  − C0 ) + 
(1 + i)1 
(1 + i)2 
(1 + i)t 
•  NPV  decreasing  in  interest  rate  for  pro jects  with  up-front  costs  and  future  payoﬀs 
III.  Increasing  Savings 
•	 Savings  important  for  economic  growth 
•	 Government  encourages  savings  using  tax  subsidies  to  retirement  savings

6  Lecture  23:  Equity  and  Eﬃciency  (Chapter  10) 

I.  Equity  and  Eﬃciency 

II.  Choosing  the  Socially  Optimal  Allocation 
•	 Social welfare  function  (SWF)  can  be  though  of  as  a  utility  function  for  society  taking  individual 
utilities  as  inputs


• 

• 

Utilitarian  SWF 

Rawlsian  SWF


SW F  = f (U1 , U2 , . . .)


SW F  = U1  + U2  + . . . 


SW F  = min(U1 , U2 , . . .) 

III.  Inequality  in  the  US  and  Around  the World 
•	 See  class  handouts  on  inequality,  poverty  line,  poverty  rates  over  time 
IV.  Sources  of  Leakage 
•	 Recall  transfer  program  discussed  in  class  –  leads  to  decrease  in  labor  supply  especially  among 
those  who  qualify  or  are  originally  near  the  cutoﬀ  to  receive  the  subsidy. 
•	 Distortionary  taxation  leads  to  DWL  –  this  is  the  cost  of  redistribution 

7  Lecture  24:  Taxation  and  Redistribution 

I.  Taxation  in  the  U.S. 

1.  Income  tax  (progressive, main  tax  in  the  U.S.) 
2.  Payroll  tax  (ﬂat) 
3.  Consumption  tax  (regressive,  paid  on  spending  rather  than  earnings) 
4.  Property  tax  (tax  on  wealth) 
5.  Corporate  tax  (tax  on  businesses,  small  share  of  total  tax  revenue) 

II.  What  Should We  Tax? 
•	 European  countries  raise  most  revenue  through  VAT  on  consumption 
•	 Consumption  taxes  encourage  savings  but  not  progressive 
•	 Excise  taxes  usually  on  “sin  goods”  (goods  with  negative  externalities  in  consumption) 
III.  What  is  the  Right  Tax  Rate?

· 
•	
Tax  revenues  = base  t

•	 As  tax  rate  rises,  base  shrinks


d(base)

d(tax  revenue) 
· 
= base + t 
dt 
dt 	
•	 Laﬀer  curve →  tax  revenue  initially  rising,  then  falling with  tax  rate  (depends  on  elasticity of  tax 
base) 

IV.  Low  Income  Programs  in  the  U.S. 
•	 Importance  of  targeting  assistance  programs 
•	 Earned  Income  Tax  Credit  (EITC)  is  a  wage  subsidy  program  that  balances  targeting  and  eﬃ­
ciency
