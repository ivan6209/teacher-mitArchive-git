Introduction to HCED: Hippocratic Oath Assignment 
 

 
The Hippocratic Oath has provided a foundation for ethical medical practice for 
centuries. Planning practice, which is concerned with revitalizing (or healing) 
communities rather than individuals, has developed no parallel code of ethics. Read the 
modern Hippocratic Oath (below) and develop a similar oath for the planning profession.  
 
 
Hippocratic Oath -- Modern Version 
 
I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant: 
 
I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such 
knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow. 
 
I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures which are required, avoiding those twin traps of 
overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism. 
 
I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and 
understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug. 
 
I will not be ashamed to say "I know not," nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another 
are needed for a patient's recovery. 
 
I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may 
know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all 
thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with 
great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God. 
 
I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness 
may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if 
I am to care adequately for the sick. 
 
I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure. 
 
I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, 
those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm. 
 
If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection 
thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience 
the joy of healing those who seek my help.
