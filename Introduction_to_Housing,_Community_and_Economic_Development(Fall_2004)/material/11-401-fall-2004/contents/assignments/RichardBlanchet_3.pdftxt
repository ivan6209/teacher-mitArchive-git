Introduction   

 

Historically the role of planners has focused on producing land use/development plans, housing 

development, and in some limited cases, economic development (as related to job creation).  However, 

planners  should  undertake  a  more  holistic  and  global  role,  to  include  not  only  the  historical  roles  of 

planners  but  also  to  promote  community  organization,  including  housing  and  economic  development, 

health  care,  and  education.    These  last  two  tasks  have  historically  been  ignored  by  the  planning 

profession.    However,  all  three  of  these  activities  are  integral  to  each  other  and  need  to  be  addressed 

together  by  the  planning  profession  if  the  goal  is  to  improve  the  viability,  vitality,  and  well-being  of 

low-income communities.         

 

Government agencies  (federal, state and  local) see  these aspects of community development as 

separate  entities  that  do  not  intersect  each  other  (hence  the  numerous  government  agencies  for 

employment,  housing,  health  care,  and  education).    Budgeted  funds  for  any  of  these  aspects  of 

community  development  fall  under  an  alphabet  soup  of  government  that  essentially  do  not  interact 

with each other  (i.e.,  the  right hand does not know what  the  left hand  is doing).   Government agencies 

fund  their  own  programs  without  consideration  of  the  economies  of  scale  that  can  be  achieved  if  the 

agencies  coordinated  with  each  other.    The  limited  social  program  funding  for  inner-city  low  income 

communities,  already  under  attack  by  the  present  federal  administration,  is  misdirected  through  the 

myriad of programs and often squandered within the bureaucratic machine.  

 

The  funding  that  does  get  granted  is  used  for  housing  (and  to  a more  limited  extent,  economic 

development).    These  investments  produce  quick  and  visible  changes.      But  the  focus  on  housing 

development does not respond to community needs and priorities.   

 

Health Care and Educational Needs 

 

One  of  those  needs  and  priorities  is  health  care  in  low  income  neighborhoods.    For  example, 

there is now one physician for every 95 people in Boston (Meyers 1993).  However, this statistic is not 

RichardBlanchet_3

reflected  in  Boston's  inner-city  neighborhoods.  Blacks  and  Latinos  now  comprise  some  35%  of  the 

population  who  mostly  reside  in  Roxbury,  Dorchester,  and  Mattapan.    The  health  problems  faced  by 

these  people  are  staggering.  The  infant  mortality  for  black  babies  is  roughly  triple  the  rate  for  white 

infants;  19  in  every  1,000  black  babies  born  each  year  die  before  their  first  birthday  (Meyers,  1993).  

Black  men  between  the  ages  of  45  and  64  have  a  13%  higher  mortality  rate  from  heart  disease  than 

white  men  in  that  age  range,  and  a  36%  higher  mortality  rate  from  all  cancers  (Meyers,  1993).    The 

communities  of  Roxbury  and  Mattapan  are  the  least  well-served  by  organized  medicine;  there  is  one 

doctor  for every 6,500 people.    In  fact, only a handful of primary care physicians now work  in  solo or 

group  medical  practices  in  these  communities.    Residents  of  Roxbury,  Dorchester,  and  Mattapan 

typically  receive  health  care  either  from  one  of  the  12  community  health  centers  scattered  throughout 

these  neighborhoods,  or  from  the  emergency  or  ambulatory  care  departments  of Boston City Hospital 

and Carney Hospital  (Meyers,  1993).   The  12  community  health  centers  provide  the  primary,  in  some 

instances  the  only, medical  care  to  residents  in  these  communities.    In  1992,  these  health  centers  saw 

about  82,000  patients  (Meyers,  1993).  Although  these  health  centers  receive  a  major  portion  of  their 

funding  through  federal  sources  under  Section  330  of  the  Public  Health  Service  Act,  the  funding  has 

been seriously inadequate for the demand or cut in the last twelve years.   

 

Another  need  and  priority  overlooked  in  low-income  communities  is  education  at  all  levels, 

including  pre-school,  elementary  and  secondary  school.   Most  children  do  not  encounter  school  until 

age  5,  unless  they  happen  to  be  in  an  unusually  rigorous  preschool  program  (Traub,  2000).  Anyone 

who has ever  reared a child knows how  immense, and  lasting,  the effects of  those  first  five years. Nor 

is  school quite as all- encompassing as  it  seems: academic work  typically  takes up only  about half  the 

time  that  children  spend  in  school.  And  whom  you  hang  out  with,  both  during  and  after  school,  can 

matter more  than what  happens  in  the  classroom.   Children who  grew  up  in  a world without  books  or 

even stimulating games, whose natural curiosity is regularly squashed, who are isolated from the world 

RichardBlanchet_3

beyond  their  neighborhood,  will  not  be  capable  of  meeting  the  demands  of  tomorrow’s  job  market.  

Less  than  half  of  ninth  graders  entering  high  school  in  large  urban  city  systems  typically  graduate  in 

four  years  (Anyon,  1997).    The  large  percentage  of  students  needing  special  services  or  programs 

strain  city  school  budgets,  in  some  cases  accounting  for  25%  of  school  expenses  (Anyon,  1997).  

Despite  the  greater  need,  79%  of  large  city  schools  are  funded  at  a  lower  rate  than  the  suburban 

schools.    Nationally,  advantaged  suburban  schools  spend  as  much  as  ten  times  that  spend  by  poor 

urban  schools  (Anyon,  1997).    Inner  city  schools  can  be  typically  described  as  old  school  buildings, 

many  dating  from  the  late  19th  and  early  20th  century.    These  building  have  not  been well maintained 

over  the  years.    Classrooms  have  few  instructional  supplies  and  little  equipment  and  students  tend  to 

have  less  access  to  science  and math programs. For  example,  the Roxbury neighborhood  is  short over 

1,000  elementary  school  seats  annually  and  none  of  the  new  school  assignment  plans  under 

consideration  would  resolve  this  or  other  classroom  seat  shortages  in  several  neighborhoods  (Arroyo, 

2004).   However, poor  immigrants  tend  to  settle  in  these neighborhoods,  already  taxing  an  inadequate 

education system.      

 

In  summary,  the  decoupling  of  housing  and  economic  development  from  health  care  and 

education  and  general  inadequate  funding  for  low-income  and  poor  communities  contributes  to  the 

perpetual  cycle  of  poor  health  (including  lower  birth  rate,  lower  survival  rate),  low  socioeconomic 

status,  low  self-esteem,  increased  violence  (including  increased  rate  of  criminal  convictions), 

decreased security, increased mental and/or behavioral problems, and increased incidence of suicide.   

 

One  of  the  results  associated  with  the  laisser-faire  attitude  of  governments  is  the  number  of 

incarcerated  convicts  in  US  federal,  state,  and  local  jails.    Currently,  the  US  holds  the  dubious 

distinction  of  having  the  greatest  percentage  of  it  population  behind  bars.    By  the  end  of  2003,  there 

were  2,085,620  prisoners  held  in  federal  or  state  prisons  or  in  local  jails  --  an  increase  of  2.6%  from 

year-end 2002 (USDOJ, 2004).  There were an estimated 482 prison inmates per 100,000 US residents

-- up from 411 at yearend 1995.  At year-end 2003, there were 3,405 black male prisoners per 100,000 

black males  in prison,  compared  to 1,231 Hispanic male  inmates per 100,000 Hispanic males  and 465 

white male  inmates per 100,000 white males  (USDOJ, 2004).      In  fiscal 2001 Federal, State, and  local 

governments spent over $167 billion  for police protection, corrections and  judicial and  legal activities, 

a 7% increase over 2000.  The cost of housing all these inmates, assuming $30,000 per inmate per year 

(housing can range between $20,000  to $60,000), represents approximately $63 billion.   In addition,  if 

we  assume  lost  taxation  revenue  for  each  inmate  conservatively  earning  $30,000  per  year  at  a  20% 

income  tax  rate,  the  federal  and  state  also  lost  an  additional  $12.5  billion.    Coupled  with  the  lost 

economic  benefits  derived  from  day-today  spending,  which  can  be  conservatively  estimated  to  be 

another $12 to $15 billion, the federal and state governments are incurring approximately $90 billion in 

lost-opportunity  revenue.    Steven  Barnett,  a  professor  of  economics  at  Rutgers,  has  estimated  that  it 

would  cost  $25  to  $30  billion  to  offer  an  enriched  pre-school  program  to  every  poverty-level  child  in 

the  country.    Considering  the  costs  for  federal,  state  and  local  police  protection,  judicial  and  legal 

activities,  housing  inmates,  and  lost  opportunity  revenue,  this  is  a  small  price  to  pay  for  our  future 

generation.   

Health and Educational Planning Process in Low-Income Communities 

 

As  presented  in  the  above  discussion,  the  communities  of  Roxbury, Dorchester,  and Mattapan 

have  their  share  of  problems.    Newly  arriving  immigrants,  who  tend  to  be  poor,  more  often  than  not 

will  settle  in  one  of  these  three  neighborhoods.    These  three  neighborhoods  are  home  to  a  variety  of 

ethnic  groups,  including  African-Americans,  Cape  Verdeans,  Caribbeans,  Italians,  Jews,  South 

Americans,  Southeast  Asians,  and  Irish.    Without  a  doubt,  these  three  neighborhoods  contain  a  high 

concentration of  urban poor  for Boston.   Some of  the more well-known  urban  redevelopment  projects 

are  located  in  these  communities,  including  Franklin  Field.    Although  community  development 

corporations  are  present  in  these  communities  providing  much  needed  services,  the  tasks  at  hand  is 

RichardBlanchet_3

daunting.    As  stated  earlier,  the  success  of  these  community  development  corporations  is  measured 

mainly in the number of housing units made available and to some extent economic development (e.g., 

job  training,  local  small  business  development).    Because  the  community  development  corporations’ 

resources are stretched thin in providing their services, health care and education has gotten little to no 

consideration in these communities.        

 

I propose the following planning process to help address the pressing issue of health care and 

education in low-income communities.   

•  Establish schools in these communities with a walking radius of no more than ½ to ¾ miles.  If 
a  school  is  already  present,  it  should  be  renovated  (inside  and  out)  to  improve  the  physical 
integrity  of  the  structure,  improve  attractiveness,  and  provide  green  space  in  the  school  yard.  
The  classrooms  need  to  be  stocked  with  materials  (books,  computers)  and  supplies  of 
equivalent  quality  as  found  in  suburban  schools  (i.e.,  not  hand-me  downs).    The  renovation  of 
the  school  should  also  include  a  library  that  is  also  well  stocked  with  reading  materials,  and 
computer  terminals  to search  the  internet.   A well equipped cafeteria should also be planned  to 
provide breakfast and lunch to the students to meet their daily dietary requirements.  If a school 
is  not  located  within  the  walking  guideline  mentioned  above,  a  new  school  needs  to  be 
constructed.    Amenities  in  the  new  schools  need  to  be  on  par  with  the  suburban  schools.  
Furthermore,  when  planning  for  schools,  the  city  should  use  readily-available  U.S.  census 
numbers  to  plan  for  future  demographic  trends  and  build  school  capacity  in  proximity  to 
growing student populations (Aroyo, 2004).   
•  By  establishing  schools  that  are  better  equipped  to  teach  the  much  needed  curriculum,  these 
schools  can  then  attract  better  trained  and  motivated  teaching  and  counseling  staff.    Students 
then benefit from these role models.      
•  Health care centers and day care centers  should also be established within  the  school buildings 
to  take  advantage  of  economies  of  scale  (decreased  rent  for  medical  and  day  care  centers, 
source  of  revenue  for  the  school).    Not  only  do  the  health  and  day  care  centers  benefit 
economically,  the  children  and  parents  also  benefit  from  much  improved  health  care  as  it  is 
located in close proximity to their home and within school grounds.

In  order  to  facilitate  education  for  adults,  the  schools  can  also  be  used  for  adult  education 
and/or  job  training  programs.    If  the  adult  is  a  single  parent  with  children,  they  can  avail 
themselves of the day care center for their children. 
In  order  to  improve  the  education,  parents  should  be  encourage  to  take  an  active  role  in  their 
children school activities by volunteering in after school programs, mentoring, provide security 
for the children.   
•  Funding  for  these  programs  can  come  from  the  existing  government  programs,  but  more 
importantly from the redistribution of funds allocated to the suburban schools.  The discrepancy 
in funding between suburban schools and inner city schools needs to be addressed by allocating 
more funds  to  the  inner city schools.   Although not  immediately measurable,  these measures  in 
health  care  and  education  will  have  a  long  term  impact  for  future  generations  by,  hopefully, 
reversing  the  trend  of  incarceration  in  US  jails.    This  fact  alone  can  save  billions  of  dollars 
associated  with  police  protection,  judicial  and  legal  activities,  and  housing  inmates.    In 
addition, community health centers have established patient populations as well as an historical 
presence, clout, and  trust within  their communities.   For  this  reason,  financial support  for  these 
centers should be both strengthened and stabilized.   
•  Finally,  to  increase  the number of primary care providers  in  inner-cities,  it will be  important  to 
make private medical practice in underserved areas more attractive for younger physicians with 
large  educational  debt  (Meyers,  1993).   One  possibility would  be  educational  loan  forgiveness 
to  support  decisions  to  practice  in  areas  where  care  is  desperately  needed.  In  addition,  third-
party  insurers  can  help  by  facilitating  receipt  of  payments  for  medical  services.  Finally, 
reimbursement  rates  for  all  practicing  physicians  should  be  equalized  within  a  given 
community,  since  all  physicians  within  that  community  are  seeing  the  same  volume  and 
complex  mixture  of  patients,  and  are  being  held  (legally  and  ethically)  to  a  "community 
standard" of medical practice. 

 

 

These  are  only  a  few  ideas  to  integrate  health  care  and  education  into  housing  and  community 

development  in  low-income  communities.    It  is  imperative  that  all  these  aspects  of  community 

development be address concurrently as  they cannot be  separated one  from each other.   Good housing 

initiative  is  a  great  start  for  low-income  communities,  but  without  the  prospect  of  a  better  education

(for  a  more  fulfilling  life),  and  health  care  to  address  the  increased  stress  and  associated  health 

problems often face by people in low-income communities, the initiative falls flat.
