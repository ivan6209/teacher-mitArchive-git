Problem Set 6: Word Game II 
Handed out: Thursday, October 9th, 2008. 
DUE: 11:59pm Thursday October 16th, 2008 

Introduction 

In this problem set you will write a program that will play the 6.00 word game all by itself. It is an 
extension to Problem Set 5, in which you wrote a word game that a human could play. 

Workload 
Please let us know how long you spend on each problem. We want to be careful not to overload you by 
giving out problems that take longer than we anticipated. 

Collaboration 
You may work with other students. However, each student should write up and hand in his or her 
assignment separately. Be sure to indicate with whom you have worked. For further details, please 
review the collaboration policy as stated in the syllabus. 

Problem #1: How long? 

You have a friend who consistently beats you when playing the word game because she takes forever 
to play. You decide to change the rules of the game to fix her wagon. Points are awarded as before, 
except the points awarded for a word are divided by the amount of time taken to find the word. Points 
for a word should be displayed to two decimal places. 

First, make a copy of your ps5.py and call it ps6.py

(Make sure the word list, words.txt, is also in the same directory.)


Modify the play_hand function so that your game looks something like this (note the lines in

bold):

Current Hand:  a c i h m m z

Enter word, or a . to indicate that you are finished: him 

It took 6.47 seconds to provide an answer.
him earned 1.24 points. Total: 1.24 points 

Current Hand:  a c m z

Enter word, or a . to indicate that you are finished: cam 

It took 3.25 seconds to provide an answer.
cam earned 2.15 points. Total: 3.39 points 

Current Hand:  z

Enter word, or a . to indicate that you are finished: .

Total score: 3.39 points.


Note: What happens when someone enters a word extremely fast? Because time is calculated in 
discrete chunks with some minimum value, it is possible to enter a word so fast that the total 
time taken rounds to zero seconds and a zero divide error occurs. If this happens, decide what 
you think  is a reasonable thing to do, and do it. Be sure to document your change. 

Hint: The following code will tell you how long it takes to enter your name: 
import time

start_time = time.time()


name = raw_input('What is your name?: ')

end_time = time.time() 

total_time = end_time - start_time

print 'It took %0.2f to enter your name' % total_time 


Problem #2: Time Limit 

You still find it boring to watch your friend think for long periods of time while playing the 6.00 word 
game. You decide to add a "chess clock" to the game. This limits the total amount of time, in seconds, 
that a player can spend to play a hand. 

Modify your game so the output looks something like the following. Your program should prompt 
for a time limit and stop counting score for any words entered after the time has run out. In 
addition, print the time remaining (if it is >=0) after each input. 

You should time the user input for both valid and invalid words and include them in the time 
total. Also, you should time only the user input, and not the processing done by the computer. 
Enter time limit, in seconds, for players: 8

Current Hand:  a c i h m m z

Enter word, or a . to indicate that you are finished: him 

It took 6.47 seconds to provide an answer. 

You have 1.53 seconds remaining.

him earned 1.24 points. Total: 1.24 points 

Current Hand:  a c m z

Enter word, or a . to indicate that you are finished: cam 

It took 3.25 seconds to provide an answer. 

Total time exceeds 8 seconds. You scored 1.24 points.


Problem #3: Computer Player 

You've spent so much time working on 6.00 that, unfortunately, you don't actually have any friends 
left to play the word game with you. So, nerd that you have become, you decide to implement support 
for computer players. 
Instead of having the user enter words, we will replace the call to raw_input (inside play_hand) with 
a call to the following function: 
def pick_best_word(hand, points_dict):
"""
 Return the highest scoring word from points_dict that can be made with the
given hand.
 Return '.' if no words can be made with the given hand.
""" 
...implement me!... 

(Some of you may object to the name of this function. The highest scoring single word may not be the 
best in terms of maximizing the total value that can be extracted from a hand. We will talk about this 
issue later in the term.) 

As the first step of this problem, write the following pre-processing function: 
def get_words_to_points(word_list):
"""
 Return a dict that maps every word in word_list to its point value. 

 """


Think about how many times this function needs to be called -- should it be called once per game, 
once per hand, or once per turn within a single hand? For this implementation, you should create 
a global variable points_dict to store the resulting dictionary. 
Next, change the implementation of is_valid_word to take as an argument the representation 
you created above rather than the word_list itself. Remember that the choice of representation 
can have a big impact on performance. This modification will improve the complexity of 
is_valid_word from O(len(word_list)) to O(1). 
Finally, write pick_best_word. (There's no need to be overly clever or worry about optimizing it a 
lot; write a straightforward implementation that you can easily debug.) Modify play_hand to call 
it. 

It wouldn't be fair  to give the computer player  the same time that is allowed to human players. 
Use the following function to set the time limit for your computer. Notice that it is intended to 
deal with the fact that some computers are faster than others by timing some basic operations. 
Test your  implementation using k=1 and other values. 
import time 
def get_time_limit(points_dict, k):
"""
 Return the time limit for the computer player as a function of the
multiplier k.
 points_dict should be the same dictionary that is created by
get_words_to_points.
"""
 start_time = time.time()
# Do some computation. The only purpose of the computation is so we can
# figure out how long your computer takes to perform a known task.
for word in points_dict:
get_frequency_dict(word)
get_word_score(word, HAND_SIZE)
end_time = time.time()
return (end_time - start_time) * k 
Again, think of how often this function should be called. Define a global variable time_limit to 
store the result of this function. 

Update on 13 Oct: Changed the function signature to avoid confusion between word_dict and 
points_dict. Note that points_dict is the one that should be passed to both get_time_limit
and pick_best_word. 

Problem #4: Even Faster Computer Player 
Now implement a faster computer player called pick_best_word_faster(hand, rearrange_dict). It 
should be based on  the following approach described below. (This is a good example of what 
pseudocode should look like). 

First, do this pre-processing before the game begins: 
Let d = {}
For every word w in the word list:
Let d[(string containing the letters of w in sorted order)] = w 

After the above pre-processing step, you have a dict where, for any set of letters, you can determine if 

there is some acceptable word that is a rearrangement of those letters. You should put the 
pre-processing code into a separate function called get_word_rearrangements, analagous to 
get_words_to_points. 

As in Problem 3, decide where this function should be called based on how many times it needs to run. 
Store the returned value in a global variable rearrange_dict. 

Now, given a hand, here's how to use that dict to find a word that can be made from that hand: 
To find some word that can be made out of the letters in HAND:
 For each subset S of the letters of HAND:
 Let w = (string containing the letters of S in sorted order)
If w in d: return d[w] 

N.B.: These are actually sub-multisets, not subsets. In a formal definition, sets cannot contain 
repeated elements, while multisets, like groups of letters within a hand, can. 

Create pick_best_word_faster based on  the pseudocode above. Modify it to return not just any 
valid word (as described above) but the highest-scoring word that can be made out of the 
letters in hand. 
Then modify your play_hand so that it calls pick_best_word_faster rather than 
pick_best_word. 

Update on 13 Oct: Changed the function signature to avoid confusion between word_dict and 
rearrange_dict. Note that rearrange_dict is the one that should be passed to 
pick_best_word_faster. 

Problem #5: Algorithm Analysis 

Characterize the time complexity of your implementation (in terms of the size of word_list and 
the number of letters in a hand) of both pick_best_word and pick_best_word_faster. 
Please put your response in comments at the end of ps6.py, like so: 
## Problem 5 ## 
# your response here.
# as many lines as you want. 

Handin Procedure 

1. Save 
All your code should be in a single file called ps6.py. This file should include complete and tested 
implementations of get_words_to_points, get_word_rearrangements, pick_best_word, and 
pick_best_word_faster. In your final ps6.py submission, the functions play_game and play_hand
should play the 6.00 word game using your choice of pick_best_word or pick_best_word_faster. 

2. Time and collaboration info 
At the start of the file, in a comment, write down the number of hours (roughly) you spent on this 
problem set, and the names of whomever you collaborated with. For example: 

# Problem Set 6
