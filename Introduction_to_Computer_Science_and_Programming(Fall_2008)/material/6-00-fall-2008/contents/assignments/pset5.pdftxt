Problem Set 5: Wordgames 
Handed out: Thursday, October 2, 2008 
Due: 11:59pm, Thursday October 9, 2008 

Introduction 

As children, we loved wordgames like Ghost. So, like any good parent or teacher, we'll now force you 
to do the things that interested us when we were younger. In this problem set, you'll implement two 
wordgames: first, we'll help you through implementing the 6.00 wordgame, and then you'll 
implement Ghost on your own. 

Don't be intimidated by the length of this problem set. It's a lot of reading, but it is very doable. 

Let's begin by describing the 6.00 wordgame: This game  is a lot like Scrabble or Text Twist, if you've 
played those. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. 
Each valid word receives a score, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word. 

The rules of the game are as follows: 

Dealing 

Scoring 

A player is dealt a hand of n letters chosen at random (assume n=7 for now). 
The player arranges the hand into a set of words using each letter at most once. 
Some letters may remain unused (these won't be scored). 

The score for the hand is the sum of the score for the words. 
The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the word, plus 50 points if all n 
letters are used on the first go. 
Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E 
is worth 1, and so on. We have defined the dictionary 
SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES 

that maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.

For example, 'weed' would be worth 8 points (4+1+1+2=8), as long as the hand actually

has 1  'w', 2  'e's, and 1 'd'.

As another example, if n=7 and you get 'waybill' on the first go, it would be worth 65

points (4+1+4+3+1+1+1=15, +50 for the 'bingo' bonus of using all seven letters).


Workload 
Please let us know how long you spend on each problem. We want to be careful not to overload you by 
giving out problems that take longer than we anticipated. 

Collaboration 
You may work with other students. However, each student should hand in the assignment separately. 
Also, be sure to indicate with whom you have worked. This is the collaboration policy for all the 
problem sets in this course. 

Getting Started 

1. Download and save 

ps5.py: the skeleton you'll fill in for Problems 1-5 
test_ps5.py: Unit tests for some of your code (more on this later) 
ps5_ghost.py: the skeleton you'll fill in for Problem 6 
words.txt: the list of valid words (all words acceptable in North American Scrabble up to 10 
letters long) 

Make sure to put all of the files in the same directory! 

2. Run the code 
Run ps5.py, without making any modifications to it, in order to ensure that everything is set up 
correctly. The code we have given you loads a list of valid words from a file and then calls the 
play_game function. You will implement the functions it needs in order to work. 

If everything is okay, after a small delay, you should see the following printed out: 
Loading word list from file...
83667 words loaded. 
play_game not implemented.
play_hand not implemented. 
If you see an IOError instead (e.g., No such file or directory), you should change the value of the 
WORDLIST_FILENAME constant (defined near the top of the file) to the complete pathname for the file 
words.txt (This will vary based on where you saved the file). 

3. Provided code 
The file ps5.py has a number of already implemented functions you can use while writing up your 
solution. You can ignore the code between the following comments, though you should read and 
understand everything else: 
# -----------------------------------
# Helper code
# (you don't need to understand this helper code) 

. . . 
# (end of helper code)
# -----------------------------------

4. Unit testing 

This problem set is structured so that you will write a number of modular functions and then glue them 
together to form the complete word playing game. Instead of waiting until  the entire game is ready, 
you should test each function you write, individually, before moving on. This approach is known as unit 
testing, and it will help you debug your code. 

We have provided several test functions to get you started. As you make progress on the problem set, 
run test_ps5.py as you go. 
If your code passes the unit tests you will see a SUCCESS message; otherwise you will see a FAILURE 
message. These tests aren't exhaustive. You may want to test your code in other ways too. 
If you run test_ps5.py using the provided ps5.py skeleton, you should see that all the tests fail. 

These are the provided test functions: 
test_get_word_score()
Test the get_word_score() implementation. 
test_update_hand()
Test the update_hand() implementation. 
test_is_valid_word()
Test the is_valid_word() implementation. 

I. Word scores 

The first step is to implement some code that allows us to calculate the score for a single word. 

Problem #1 

The function get_word_score should accept a string of lowercase letters as input (a word) and 
return the integer score for that word, using the game's scoring rules. 
Fill in the code for get_word_score in ps5.py: 
def get_word_score(word, n):
 """

 Returns the score for a word. Assumes the word is a 

 valid word.

 The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters
in the word, plus 50 points if all n letters are used on
the first go.
 Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is
worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on.
 word: string (lowercase letters)
n: integer (maximum hand size; i.e., hand size required for additional
points)

returns: int >= 0

 """
 # TO DO ... 
You may assume that the input word is always either a string of lowercase letters, or the empty 
string "". You will want to use the SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES dictionary defined at the top of 
ps5.py. You should not change its value. 
Do not assume that there are always 7 letters in a hand! The parameter n is the number of 
letters required for a bonus score (the maximum number of letters in the hand). 

Testing: 
If this function is implemented properly, and you run test_ps5.py, you should see that the 
test_get_word_score() tests pass. Also test your implementation of get_word_score, using 
some reasonable English words. 

HINT: To iterate through all the characters in a string, try something like this loop, which prints each 
letter in word: 
for letter in word:

 print letter


II. Dealing with hands 

Representing hands 

A hand is the set of letters held by a player during the game. The player is initially dealt a set of 
random letters. For example, the player could start out with the following hand: 
a, q, l, m, u, i, l 

A straightforward way to represent a hand in Python is as a list: 
hand = ['a', 'q', 'l', 'm', 'u', 'i', 'l'] 

However, we'll represent the hand in a different way, because it simplifies the code we'll need in the 
update_hand and is_valid_word functions. (In general, there are many ways to represent, in code, 
various concepts -- some are better suited to certain operations than others). 

In our program, a hand will be represented as a dictionary: the keys are (lowercase) letters and the 
values are the number of times the particular letter is repeated in that hand. For example, the above 
hand would be represented as: 
hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1} 
Notice how the repeated letter 'l' is represented. 
Notice that with a dictionary representation, the usual way to access a value is hand['a'], where 'a' 
is the key we want to find. However, this only works if the key is in the dictionary; otherwise, we get 
an error. To avoid this, we can call hand.get('a',0). This is the "safe" way to access a value if we are 
not sure the key is in the dictionary. It returns the value found if the key is in the dictionary, and 0 
otherwise. 

Converting words into dictionary representation 
One useful function we've defined for you is get_frequency_dict, defined near the top of ps5.py. 
When given a string of letters as an input, it returns a dictionary where the keys are letters and the 
values are the number of times that letter is represented in the input string. For example: 
>> get_frequency_dict("hello")
{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1} 

As you can see, this is the same kind of dictionary we use to represent hands. 

Displaying a hand 

Given a hand represented as a dictionary, we want to display it in a user-friendly way. 

We have provided the implementation for this in the the display_hand function. Make sure you 
read through this carefully and understand what it does and how it works. 
def display_hand(hand):
 """

 Displays the letters currently in the hand.

 For example:
display_hand({'a':1, 'x':2, 'l':3, 'e':1})
Should print out something like:
a x x l l l e
 The order of the letters is unimportant.
 hand: dictionary (string -> int)
""" 
for letter in hand.keys():
for j in range(hand[letter]):
print letter, # the comma ensures everything in the for loop prints on
the same line 
print # this just prints an empty line 

Generating a random hand 

The hand a player is dealt is a set of letters chosen at random. We now need a function that generates 
this random hand. We have to be careful when randomly picking a hand. We need to ensure that there 
are enough VOWELS in the hand to allow the player to spell some words. 
In our implementation, we use the randrange function from the random module to generate random 
numbers. Note that we import random at the top of ps5.py, and use the syntax random.randrange()
to call randrange from inside module random. Make sure you read through our implementation of 
deal_hand carefully, and understand what it does and how it works. 
import random
def deal_hand(n):
 """

 Returns a random hand containing n lowercase letters.

At least n/3 of the letters in the hand should be VOWELS. 

 Hands are represented as dictionaries. The keys are 

letters and the values are the number of times the 

 particular letter is repeated in that hand.

 n: int >= 0

 returns: dictionary (string -> int)

""" 
hand={}

num_vowels = n / 3

for i in range(num_vowels):

x = VOWELS[random.randrange(0,len(VOWELS))]

hand[x] = hand.get(x, 0) + 1

for i in range(num_vowels, n):
x = CONSONANTS[random.randrange(0,len(CONSANANTS))]
hand[x] = hand.get(x, 0) + 1 
return hand 
Notice the access of values using hand.get(x,0) because we do not know if the key x is in the 
dictionary, as discussed in the Representing hands section. 

Removing letters from a hand 

The player starts with a hand, a set of letters. As the player spells out words, letters from this set are 
used up. For example, the player could start out with the following hand: 
a, q, l, m, u, i, l 
The player could choose to spell the word quail. This would leave the following letters in the player's 
hand: 
l, m 

You will now write a function that takes a hand and a word as inputs, uses letters from that hand to 
spell the word, and returns the remaining letters in the hand. 

For example: 
>> hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1} 

>> display_hand(hand)

a q l l m u i

>> hand = update_hand(hand, 'quail') 

>> hand

{'l': 1, 'm': 1}

>> display_hand(hand)

l m


(NOTE: alternatively, in the above example, after the call to update_hand the value of hand could be 
the dictionary {'a':0, 'q':0, 'l':1, 'm':1, 'u':0, 'i':0}. The exact value depends on your 
implementation; but the output of display_hand() should be the same in either case.) 

Problem #2 
Implement the update_hand function. Make sure this function has no side effects; i.e., it cannot 
mutate the hand passed in. 
def update_hand(hand, word):
 """
 Assumes that 'hand' has all the letters in word.

 In other words, assumes that however many times

a letter appears in 'word', 'hand' has at least as 

many instances of that letter in it.

 Updates the hand: uses up the letters in the given word

and returns the new hand, without those letters in it.

 Has no side effects: does not modify hand.
 word: string

hand: dictionary (string -> int)

returns: dictionary (string -> int) 

"""
# TO DO ... 
Testing: 
Make sure the test_update_hand() tests pass. You may also want to test your implementation of 
update_hand with some reasonable inputs. 

III. Valid words 

At this point, we have written code to generate a random hand and display that hand to the user. We 
can also ask the user for a word (Python's raw_input) and score the word (using your 
get_word_score). However, at this point we have not written any code to verify that a word given by 
a player obeys the rules of the game. 

A valid word is: in the word list; and it is composed entirely of letters from the current hand. 

Problem #3 
Implement the is_valid_word function. 
def is_valid_word(word, hand, word_list):
 """

 Returns True if word is in the word_list and is entirely 

composed of letters in the hand. Otherwise, returns False.

Does not mutate hand or word_list.

 word: string

hand: dictionary (string -> int)

word_list: list of strings

"""
# TO DO ... 
Testing: 
Make sure the test_is_valid_word tests pass. In particular, you may want to test your 

implementation by calling it multiple times on the same hand — what should the correct behavior 
be? 

IV. Playing a hand 

We are now ready to begin writing the code that interacts with the player. 

Problem #4 
Implement the play_hand function. This function allows the user to play out a single hand. 
def play_hand(hand, word_list):
 """
 Allows the user to play the given hand, as follows:
 * The hand is displayed.
 * The user may input a word. Alternatively, the user may end the
game by entering a period (.).
 * An invalid word is rejected, and a message is displayed asking
the user to choose another word.
 * When a valid word is entered, it uses up letters from the hand.
 * After every valid word: the score for that word and the total
score so far are displayed, the remaining letters in the hand
are displayed, and the user is asked to input another word.
 * The sum of the word scores is displayed when the hand finishes.
 * The hand finishes when there are no more unused letters.
 The user may choose to end the hand at any time by inputting
a single period (the string '.') instead of a word.
 * The final score is displayed.
 hand: dictionary (string -> int)
word_list: list of strings
""" 
# TO DO ... 

Testing: 
Try out your  implementation as if you were playing the game. 

Note: Do not assume that there will always be 7 letters in a hand! The global variable HAND_SIZE 
represents this value. 
Here is some example output of play_hand (your output may differ, depending on what messages you 
print out): 
Current Hand:  a c i h m m z 
Enter word, or a . to indicate that you are finished: him
him earned 8 points. Total: 8 points
Current Hand:  a c m z 
Enter word, or a . to indicate that you are finished: cam
cam earned 7 points. Total: 15 points
Current Hand:  z 
Enter word, or a . to indicate that you are finished: .
Total score: 15 points. 

Update on 7 Oct: Here is an additional set of output for the case of a missed word: 
Current Hand:  a s t t w f o 
Enter word, or a . to indicate that you are finished: tow
tow earned 6 points. Total: 6 points
Current Hand:  a s t f 
Enter word, or a . to indicate that you are finished: tasf
Invalid word, please try again.
Current Hand:  a s t f 
Enter word, or a . to indicate that you are finished: fast
fast earned 7 points. Total: 13 points
Total score: 13 points. 

V. Playing a game 

A game consists of playing multiple hands. We need to implement one final function to complete our 
word-game program. 

Problem #5 
Uncomment the code that implements the play_game function. You should remove the code that 
is currently uncommented in the play_game body. Read through and make sure you understand 
what this code does and how it works. 

There is no coding for this question — the only "work" you have to do here is actually just 
uncommenting some lines and deleting some other lines of code. 
For the game, you should use the HAND_SIZE constant to determine the number of cards in a 
hand. If you like, you can try out different values for HAND_SIZE with your program. 
def play_game(word_list):
 """

 Allow the user to play an arbitrary number of hands.

 * Asks the user to input 'n' or 'r' or 'e'.
 * If the user inputs 'n', let the user play a new (random) hand.
When done playing the hand, ask the 'n' or 'e' question again.
 * If the user inputs 'r', let the user play the last hand again.
 * If the user inputs 'e', exit the game.
 * If the user inputs anything else, ask them again. 

"""
# TO DO ... 
Testing: 
Try out this implementation as if you were playing the game. 

VI. Ghost: A Different Wordgame 

Ghost is an inanely popular two-player wordgame. Our goal in this problem is to implement an 
interactive Python program that allows two humans to play a game of Ghost against each other. For 
those of you who are unfamiliar with the rules, you may read all about it here at Wikipedia. For this 
problem set, please follow the following rules. 

Rules of Ghost 

Players form a word by alternating turns saying a letter, which is added on to the end of the word 
fragment. There are two ways to lose Ghost: 

Forming a word longer than 3 letters ("PEA" is ok, but "PEAR" is not).

Creating a fragment (of any size) which cannot become a word by adding more letters (for

example, "QZ").


Winning Ghost is simply not losing! So, for example, game play proceeds like this: 

Player 1 says a letter. For example, 'P'.

Player 2 says a letter. For example, 'E'.

Player 1 says a letter. For example, 'A'. Player 1 has formed the word PEA, but that's okay 

because it is not longer than 3 letters.

Player 2 says a letter. For example, 'F'.

Player 1 says a letter. Player 1 must say 'O', because only one word starts with PEAF. If Player 1

says any other letter, for example 'A', he or she loses, because no word begins with PEAFA.

Player 2 says a letter, which must be 'W'.

Player 1 says a letter, which must be 'L'. Player 1 loses, because PEAFOWL is a word.


Problem #6 
Implement a function, ghost(), that will start up an interactive Ghost game between two human 
players. 

Getting Started 

Download and save ps5_ghost.py into the same directory as your work for this problem set. This file 
will provide you with the function to load the word list. 

Make sure your file runs properly before editing. You should get the following output when running the 
unmodified version of ps5_ghost.py. 
Loading word list from file...
83667 words loaded. 

You will want to do all of your coding for this problem within this file as well because you will be 
writing a program that depends on each function you write. 

Requirements 

Here are the requirements for your game: 

The game must be  interactive: At each step, it should say who the current player is and what

the current word fragment is.

The player should be asked to input a letter, and the program should make sure that it the input

is valid (one alphabetic character only, but it may be uppercase or lowercase).

The  letter should be added to the word fragment and the updated word fragment should be 

displayed.

The game should end if the current player has formed a word (longer than 3 characters) or no

words can be formed.

Make sure all of your code is within functions: either the main ghost() function, or another function 
that you create. 
Hint: To determine if a character is alphabetic, you can see if it is in the ascii_letters string (which 
is part of the string module that is imported). 
>> 'a' in string.ascii_letters 

True 
>> 'F' in string.ascii_letters
True 
>> '2' in string.ascii_letters
False 

Update on 7 Oct: Make sure your function accepts both lowercase and uppercase characters. 
When printing, convert to all uppercase or all lowercase characters (your choice). You may find 
the functions string.upper() and string.lower() useful — more information is available in the 
Python documentation. 

The output of an example game may look like this: 
Welcome to Ghost!

Player 1 goes first.

Current word fragment: ''

Player 1 says letter: P

Current word fragment: 'P'

Player 2's turn.

Player 2 says letter: Y

Current word fragment: 'PY'

Player 1's turn.

Player 1 says letter: T

Current word fragment: 'PYT'

Player 2's turn.

Player 2 says letter: H

Current word fragment: 'PYTH'

Player 1's turn.

Player 1 says letter: O

Current word fragment: 'PYTHO' 

Player 2's turn.

Player 2 says letter: N

Current word fragment: 'PYTHON'

Player 2 loses because 'PYTHON' is a word! 

Player 1 wins! 


Here's another example, where a player loses after making an illegal word fragment. 
Welcome to Ghost!

Player 1 goes first.

Current word fragment: ''

Player 1 says letter: P

Current word fragment: 'P'

Player 2's turn.

Player 2 says letter: Y

Current word fragment: 'PY'

Player 1's turn.

Player 1 says letter: N

Current word fragment: 'PYN'

Player 1 loses because no word begins with 'PYN'!

Player 2 wins! 


Do not be intimidated by this problem! It's actually easier  than it looks. Make sure you break down the 
problem into logical subtasks. What functions will you need to have in order for this game to work? 

This completes the problem set!
