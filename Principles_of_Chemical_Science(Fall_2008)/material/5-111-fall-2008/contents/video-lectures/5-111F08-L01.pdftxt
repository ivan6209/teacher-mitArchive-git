PROFESSOR: Welcome to 5.111, and today what we're going to do is introduce you 
to the course and the people teaching the course. And we're also going to let you 
know that you were going to be part of the great web exercise that is OCW, 
OpenCourseWare.  
 
So, this course is being videotaped this year, and this is the announcement that I 
have to make. So, the videotape is in the back, and if you want to come up front and 
participate in the class, you know that you'll be videotaped -- if you want to hide 
your face or whatever, you can do that but please pay attention to the lectures 
anyway. So, this course will be available on the OCW site in the future, I'm not sure 
exactly what that date is going to be.  
 
So, today we're going to introduce the chemistry topics, which we will cover in 
5.111, and give you general information, practical information about the course 
number of points you need, when the exams are, that kind of thing, policies, and 
introduce you to the teaching staff. I am, again, Professor Cathy Drennan, and I'm 
one of the lecturers in this course.  
 
So, because this is MIT, we're going to start to quiz. OK, not a quiz for points or 
anything, don't freak out, but I do want you to tell me who these people are. So, 
what about this person? That's me -- this is my college yearbook photo. OK, what 
about this person over here?  
 
STUDENT: You?  
 
PROFESSOR: It's not me again. Not Elizabeth Taylor. It is Lisa Kudrow, known as 
Phoebe on "Friends." So, we both went to college at the same time, we went to the 
same college. Does anybody know what college that was?  
 
STUDENT: Vassar.  
 
PROFESSOR: Vassar College, very good. And we graduated the same year -- now no 
one has to say what year that was, even if you know, but we did graduate the same 
year. All right. So, given what you know about us, what do you think Lisa went to 
college to study?  
 
STUDENT: Computer?  
 
PROFESSOR: Computers? No.  
 

STUDENT: Theatre?  
 
PROFESSOR: Theatre? Surprisingly, no.  
 
STUDENT: Nuclear Engineering?  
 
PROFESSOR: Nuclear Engineering at Vassar, no for a variety of reasons. Any other 
guesses?  
 
STUDENT: English?  
 
PROFESSOR: English, no. Biology -- I heard it. Biology. What do you think I went to 
college to study?  
 
STUDENT: Theatre.  
 
PROFESSOR: Theatre, correct! And/or I hadn't made up my mind exactly -- 
biopsychology or drama. So, biopsychology was what they called sort of brain and 
cognitive sciences in those days. So, those were the two things I was thinking about. 
What do you think Lisa ended up majoring in college?  
 
STUDENT: Biopsychology.  
 
PROFESSOR: Not biopsychology.  
 
STUDENT: Biology.  
 
PROFESSOR: Biology, yes. What do you think I majored in college? This should be a 
bit easier.  
 
STUDENT: Chemistry.  
 
PROFESSOR: Chemistry, And, of course, our professions, actress and chemistry 
professor. So, let me ask what happened here? My understanding about Lisa Kudrow 
is that she came from a Hollywood family. She went to college and said here's my 
opportunity to study the thing that I find most interesting, and that was biology, and 
then she went back and participated in the family business, which was of course the 
acting profession.  
 
For me, what happened? Well, I have to say, I did not like chemistry in high school, 
so I did not think about going to college to study chemistry. So, why did I not like 
chemistry in high school? I think it was because of images such as this one. You 
spend a lot of time talking about the transition between alchemy and modern 
chemistry. I wasn't very interested in that kind of thing, and there's nothing in these 
photographs that really appealed to me personally. I mean, Avogadro -- I'm fond of 
his number, and he is, in fact, an interesting, if not frightening looking man -- this 
just didn't connect with me.  
 
But then I got to college and they said, "Well, if you're thinking about anything bio -- 
biopsychology, biology -- you have to take chemistry." And I said to my advisor, 
"No, no. I have taken chemistry in high school, and I can assure you that chemistry 
has no relevance whatsoever to the life sciences." And they said, "Well, I'm sorry 
you feel that way, it's incorrect, and you have to take it anyway."  

 
So, I, like some of you in this room, took freshman chemistry, because we had to, 
not because we wanted to. And I, like hopefully some of you in this room, discovered 
that chemistry was actually a lot of fun, and that the chemistry I got in college was 
pretty much nothing like the chemistry I had seen in high school.  
 
So, let me introduce you to some of the topics we are going to be covering in 
chemistry this semester. So, there's more detail on your syllabus -- a detail of what 
we'll cover every day, but these are the kind of basic things that were covering, and 
you don't need to write this down, you'll become familiar with it as the semester 
goes on. We start out with some really basic principles. So, up here, atomic theory, 
periodic table, bonding, structures and molecules. And there will be a little bit of 
history in there, but this is mostly modern chemistry and represents the basic 
properties of matter, and it's basic properties of all matter, including living matter, 
which was what really interested me, that connection between chemistry and 
biology.  
 
So, then we go to thermodynamics and chemical equilibrium, and this is really about 
chemical reactions -- weather a reaction will go, will it be spontaneous, if there an 
equilibrium, what direction will the reaction be shifted in. And then, of course, not 
just whether the reaction will occur but, how fast it occurs is really important.  
 
So, that's kinetics -- how fast a reaction will go, and from the perspective of 
someone who's a biochemist, I'm interested in kinetics and enzyme kinetics, and 
thinking about molecules that catalyze reactions in the body. And then, there's acid 
base equilibrium, and also oxidation reduction reactions, and what is true is that 
most reactions that occur are either catalyzed by either some kind of acid base 
catalysis or involve some kind of oxidation reduction reaction, and so, this sort of 
represents a lot of the basic way reactions go -- now, whether that's a reaction in 
your body or a reaction in a test tube -- it doesn't matter, a lot of the same 
principles are involved.  
 
And then, we also cover transition metals, which is something that you often don't 
see in high school. And transition metals, those all medals in the middle of your 
periodic table, have some really unique properties, which are exploited again in 
reactions that occur in your body, and also are utilized in industry, for example, so 
we'll talk about some of those unique properties. And if we put all of that together, 
we get the real fundamentals that you need to go on and study -- any kind of 
curriculum that involves chemistry.  
 
So, these are all the fundamentals that are involved in chemistry that relate to 
physical chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, biological chemistry, and 
are a solid foundation for studying any kind of life science. So, I congratulate you of 
being here in this class, this is really good solid foundation for whatever you go on to 
do, here at MIT.  
 
So, normally at this point, we do actually start class with a little bit of history from 
alchemy to modern chemistry, but I decided to skip that this year. If you are 
interested in that, it's never required on any test, it never has been, but if you're 
interested in that there is an OCW lecture, which you can listen to that's an excellent 
lecture by Professor Sylvia Ceyer on that. But today instead, I thought I would give 
you some examples of modern chemistry -- why people now need to know 
chemistry, what they're doing with chemistry, what is chemistry research here at 

MIT, and how does it utilize these basic principles, which we'll be talking about in the 
course.  
 
So, I'll start with my colleague, Professor Joanne Stubbe. She studies molecules, in 
particular she studies biological molecules. And, so one of the things she's very 
interested in is how this anti-cancer drug, gemcitabine, works in the body. So, it 
inhibits an enzyme, and she's interested in knowing how that really works. So, 
enzymes are made up of amino acids, you have long chains of amino acids that form 
together into a protein molecules, protein molecules in your body often act as 
enzymes, catalyzing reactions.  
 
So, she is interested in how this molecule, gemcitabine, inhibits an enzyme. So, to 
do those studies, she needs to know a lot of the stuff on this list. Of course, she 
needs to know the basic principles, but she's also talking about it an enzyme, so she 
needs to know about enzyme catalysis. She needs to know this enzyme works by 
both acid base chemistry, and oxidation reduction. It has two irons that are involved 
in doing the chemistry, so it includes transition metals.  
 
She thinks about how things bind, how the natural reactants binds, how the inhibitor 
binds, and so she needs to know what happens to the chemical equilibrium, she 
needs to know about the thermodynamics of those binding events, and, of course, 
everything, all the basic principles, are required here. So, to do this biochemistry 
research, she needs to know all of these things, and she has really made tremendous 
progress in understanding how gemcitabine works, and it is not so toxic, so it's a 
really good thing to have in chemotherapy.  
 
So, in addition to studying molecules, chemists often want to make molecules, such 
as Tim Jamison, who's an organic chemist. So, you will hear, probably, hopefully, in 
this presidential debate about the environment and about why saving the 
environment is important. And one of the things you often hear about in this 
discussion is about our oceans and about rainforests, and part of the reason why 
people want to protect those areas is because you find a lot of natural products in 
those regions.  
 
So, a natural product is something that is made by nature, and often natural 
products, whether it comes from a plant or a marine organism have some really 
good, useful properties. And so, one particular compound has anti-tumor properties. 
So, again, along this line of cancer research.  
 
So, Tim Jamison's lab figured out how to make this thing. And often that's really 
important, because you can't get enough of the organism that naturally makes it, to 
be able to grind that organism up and have enough that you can actually use as a 
medicine. So, you have to make more of it, because nature doesn't make enough. 
So, it's very important to figure out how to do that.  
 
So, in doing that, Tim Jamison's lab needs a lot of these things. So, he needs a lot of 
knowledge of bonding, he wants to form bonds in making this. He needs to know 
about the structures of the molecules, because if the structure is wrong it's not going 
to work. And often, if you want to make a lot of it, you have to think about the 
thermodynamics of the system, how fast the reactions will go and kinetics, and then 
whether they'll go, the thermodynamics, and sometimes then you need to adjust the 
reactions, maybe use a transition metal to make it go better. So, these are all the 

things that Tim Jamison needs to know to do organic chemistry. So, you'll be 
learning in this class a great preparation for 512, which is organic chemistry.  
 
In addition to studying molecules and making molecules, some chemists want to 
detect molecules, and a chemist who likes to detect molecules is Tim Swager. So, 
Tim Swager's lab has designed sensors that detect vapors, and so they will detect 
TNT, for example. And so, he has put this chemistry to use in this robotic arm and 
they call it Fido, because often dogs are the creatures that have to go out and detect 
these things, and it's not a great job if you're a dog to be sent out to see whether 
there was an explosive and discover yes, there was, a little bit too late. So, this is a 
much nicer way to detect chemicals with this robotic arm, and here's a picture of it in 
use in Iraq. So, in doing this, if you go down to kind of a basic principles that Tim 
needed to know about, oxidation reduction was really key in developing this 
technology, so we'll talk about that.  
 
So, my final example is from Alan Davidson's lab, and Alan is an inorganic chemist -- 
he loved those transition metals and they're unique properties, and he designed this 
compound, it's called Cardiolite, and it's used in heart imaging. So, many people 
have relatives they know of that have had to have their heart imaged -- heart 
disease is a major problem in the United States, and there's a good chance that they 
had Cardiolite given to them to help in that imaging process. So, this again, takes 
advantage of those great unique properties of transition metals, which we'll talk 
about in this course.  
 
So, again, all together, this is the basis for modern chemistry, and examples I just 
gave you, are some of the things that modern chemists are working on -- some of 
the issues that our country faces and our world faces, and how chemistry is involved 
in that. So, not only will you have the fundamental knowledge to go on and take 
more courses in chemistry, you will also have the fundamental knowledge to go on 
and do undergraduate research here, and here are some of the 5.111 undergraduate 
researchers that have come through my lab, in particular, from this class. So, it's a 
really nice solid foundation.  
 
So, I want to encourage you to set some of your likes and dislikes from high school 
aside when you come to MIT, because at MIT you often see disciplines taught and 
emphasize a very different fashion than what you've seen before. And you may 
discover that the thing you came here to study is not the thing that you really want 
to study after all.  
 
One other thing that I'll say to you is that I said these words at one point, it's true, I 
said, when I was in high school, I said, "I hate chemistry." And now, I do chemistry 
every day and will for the rest my life. I love chemistry now. Be very careful what 
you say. Have any of you made that statement about hating a subject? Tell me later 
what it is you're going to be doing for the rest of your life.  
 
So, at MIT things are very different, and keep an open mind, explore new areas -- 
take advantage of being at this amazing place for science and technology and you 
may surprise yourself in what you really enjoy learning about.  
 
So, that's a little bit about the chemistry that we're going to cover in this class, and 
now I'm going to talk a little bit about some of the policies and procedures. But first I 
need to introduce my co-instructor for this class, and let me just put up her picture, 
you'll see her in a minute. So, Dr. Beth Vogel Taylor.  

 
So, all chemistry courses are team taught, so you have a different lecturer for the 
first half than the second half, and Dr. Taylor will be doing most of the first half 
lectures, and I'll be doing most of the second half lectures. So, Dr. Taylor will take 
you from atomic theory through thermodynamics, and I'll start up with chemical 
equilibrium, talk to about kinetics, acid base, oxidation reduction and transition 
metals. So, you will have both of us as lecturers in this class. Now, in the past, 
sometimes students have found this whole thing a little frustrating, that they just get 
used to one lecture style, and then all of a sudden there's another lecture style, and 
that can be true. I mean sometimes the styles of the two professors couldn't be 
more different -- think McCain/Palin, odd couples. Sometimes they're more similar, 
and when I first, about a year and a half ago, got to know Dr. Taylor, we sort of 
realized that we had very similar styles, and we got very excited about the idea that 
we could teach together, so that there would be much more continuity throughout 
the semester.  
 
And so, Dr. Taylor had been teaching the first half of the material in the Spring, and 
I had been teaching the second half of the material in the Fall, and we thought 
wouldn't it be great if we got together and taught in the Fall. So, this was actually, 
for a variety of reasons, a very complicated thing to request and do, and so we 
started a campaign and campaigned for a year and a half that we should be allowed 
to do this course together, and finally just a few weeks ago in August -- we really 
didn't know up until almost when this course started -- that permission was granted. 
So, I have to say, I am very excited now to introduce you to Dr. Taylor, who I would 
be teaching with this semester -- limited engagement -- who will tell you about some 
of the course policies.  
 
PROFESSOR: Okay, so before we get to some of these course policies, I think I'll tell 
you a little bit about my path to chemistry as well. Professor Drennan explained that 
not everyone that ends up as a chemist started off that way on their first class 
freshman year, for example, in chemistry. And in fact, if you talk to a lot of chemists, 
if you talk to some of the graduate students, maybe your TA, you'll find that that 
phrase, "I hate chemistry," has maybe been uttered by more than one us at some 
point in our lives before we realized, and once it happens you don't go back, that 
actually you love chemistry and it's hard to even remember a point where you didn't 
see all of these connections that it provided for you.  
 
To give a little background of where I was, sitting where maybe you are today on the 
first day of chemistry, when I left high school, I had no interest in chemistry 
whatsoever. And I have only one strong memory from high school chemistry, and 
that memory is shown right here, and that is the common ions. Did you guys have to 
learn the common ions? Does anyone have that in their brain somewhere for ready 
use? I don't, in fact, so it's actually okay if you don't know all your common ions, if 
you missed that part. This is the strongest memory I have, and I remembered a) 
that I didn't learn them, and that was really bad because it kept coming up, but the 
other thing I remember is that I had no idea why they were important. I didn't really 
understand what any of these molecules were. I certainly didn't understand how they 
even connected really to chemical reactions, much less other disciplines that I was 
interested in. I couldn't have told you, for example, if we look at a phosphate group, 
that that's going to be incredibly important in DNA, that it's also an incredibly 
important group when you're dealing with proteins and whether you're turning the 
function of a protein on or off.  
 

So really, I just had no context for the chemistry. So, when I started in college, that 
wasn't even an option for me and I was interested in a lot of things, chemistry not 
being one. But one that I was very interested in was biology, and the reason was we 
did a lot of cool labs in high school, I loved doing the dissections -- it was very 
interesting to me to think about how different organs worked, how the heart could be 
a pump, how the lungs worked. And then when we got to more of a cellular level, it 
was even more interesting to see that we could actually understand how our body 
worked as low of a level as thinking about cells.  
 
And so, that was a clear major for me to pick -- I actually also was considering 
English and ended up being a minor in English. But, I think what most of you, 
actually having come to MIT, have probably realized is sometimes it's nice to major 
in a science, because you can't just pick up a reaction and do it in your kitchen on 
the weekend, where as you can sometimes join a book group and do that. So, it's 
kind of nice to major in the thing that you're going to get to have the opportunity to 
do for the rest of your life.  
 
So, I actually also started pre-med. Is anyone else pre-med here? Okay, so a pretty 
good showing. So maybe you can relate to some of the reasons I wanted to be 
pretty pre-med -- part of it was the interest in the science and the biology. Also, I 
wanted to help people -- it seemed like a really clear way that I could have a career 
that was challenging and involved in science, but also helping others. So, it seemed 
like a good start for me, pre-med/bio, and I signed up for my bio class -- I found 
out, as Professor Drennan did, that I had to take chemistry as well. I wasn't as 
upset, I was sort of a neutral chemistry person at this point, but I thought it was 
pretty smart to get it over with on the first semester, so that's what I did. And my 
plan was going along fine until something happened, and what happened was that 
chemistry was just way more interesting than I anticipated.  
 
So, my perfect pre-med/bio plan was getting a little shaken right from the start, and 
the reason that it was getting taken was because I would learn this new principal in 
chemistry and because I was taking bio with the same time, I could see the 
connections. And at one point I realized, "Oh, my gosh, chemistry is just biology, it's 
just looking at one level deeper." So actually, all of my interest in biology was 
quickly transferred to saying, "Wow, now I can think about things on the molecular 
level." And one of the molecules that caught my attention first, and I can't remember 
if this was freshman or sophomore year in high school, was the first time I actually 
took meaning in looking at a chemical structure, and that was with the structure of 
penicillin here, and I know that all of you are familiar with penicillin, whether or not 
you know the structure or not, but the most important part of this structure is the 
four-membered ring here, the beta-lactam, and this was the first time I thought I 
could actually understand how a molecule worked because I knew something about 
chemistry.  
 
So, for example with penicillin what it does is it inhibits an enzyme that builds the 
cell wall in bacteria, the bacterial cell wall, and if I thought about what I'd learned in 
chemistry -- some of you know this from high school, some of you will be very 
familiar with this soon, is that this carbon here, for example, is bonded to three 
things. Does anyone know what angle those would like to be at? 120. They want to 
get as far away from each other possible, the ideal angle is 120. But what we have 
here is a four-membered ring, so what angle does that have to be, that bond? 90 
degrees. So, we have a problem here if we're thinking about keeping things at the 
lowest energy, so there's a lot of ring strain in the system. And I was incredibly 

excited that I could look at that and realize it and say "Wow, that's why it's so 
reactive, that's why it's such a good medication," because when it comes into contact 
with these bacterial cell wall building enzyme, the enzyme can actually react with 
this four-membered ring and open up the ring and relieve that ring strain. So, now 
the angles can open up all the way to 120 if it wants to, and there's no way it's going 
to form that ring again, right, because it's not going to back to those 90 degree 
angles, if it can help it. So now, the enzyme is locked up with the penicillin molecule, 
no more bacterial cell wall being built, and the penicillin has effectively killed the 
bacteria.  
 
So, that, for me, was kind of the first connection that what went, "Woah, wait a 
second, I want to be thinking about these molecules all the way down to the level of 
individual atoms." So, at this point, kept the pre-med, just switched the major to 
chemistry.  
 
The next problem came up when I went and took organic chemistry. So, if you're 
dead set on staying with bio, maybe, I guess you have to take organic, so this might 
happen to you, just to warn you. We started looking at all sorts of other kinds of 
molecules that became very interesting to me. I especially love thinking about 
vitamins and drugs, because I do have that interest in medicine and human health. 
These are actually all examples that we'll talk about in freshman chemistry at some 
point, as an example of a connection between a chemical principle we learn, and 
what we can know about how it functions.  
 
But what happened here was I thought "Oh, my gosh, now I could actually, using my 
chemical knowledge, think about synthesizing these molecules, or maybe coming up 
with new ways to synthesize them better or synthesize different molecules. And the 
real clincher was when I started doing some undergraduate research. Any potential 
UROPs out there -- anyone planning to do a research at some point? Excellent. Okay. 
So, just to be warned, you might fall in love with the subject you do your UROP in.  
 
This is one of our summer students from this past summer, who is also premed. 
She's continuing to be pre-med, which is fantastic. That didn't happen to me -- once 
I got into the lab, I didn't want to leave. So, I thought, "You know what, I think I'll 
change the medical school plans and now I'm going to go all the way -- chemistry 
major, chemistry grad school." And the reason I was able to do that and keep with 
what my original intentions were was to have a career that was the fulfilling, in 
terms of helping people and being engaged in science, is all of a sudden I realized, 
as chemists, we can think about better ways to build molecules that are important 
for making medications.  
 
Another thing we can do is we can use our chemistry to understand biological 
systems, so we can help illucinate pathways, maybe, that are implicated in disease. 
So, the combination of these two things had made my decision and I ended up 
coming here for graduate school, actually, and working in Professor Imperiali's lab 
doing bio-organic chemistry, which means that I synthesize molecules, which I 
loved, and used them to study biological systems.  
 
So, really I'm pretty happy with what I've gotten to do, and I just want to say we're 
not trying to convert all of them you pre-med people, by any means. My roommate 
for many years was going to medical school as I was going to graduate school, and 
we found we had so many interesting conversations about chemistry -- her from the 

context of practicing and using medications and talking about how they worked on a 
molecular level, and me talking about my research.
