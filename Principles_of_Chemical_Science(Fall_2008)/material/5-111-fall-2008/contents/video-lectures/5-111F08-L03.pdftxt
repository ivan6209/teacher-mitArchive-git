PROFESSOR: And this is a question based on where we left off on Wednesday -- we 
were talking about Coulomb's force law to describe the interaction between two 
particles, and good job, most of you got this correct. 

So, what we're looking at here is the force when we have two charged particles, one 
positive, one negative -- here, the nucleus and an electron. So, I know this is a 
simple example and I can see everyone pretty much got it right, and probably those 
that didn't actually made some sort of clicker error is my guess. 

But I wanted to use this to point out that in this class in general, any time you see 
an equation to explain a certain phenomenon, such as here looking at force, it's a 
good idea to check yourself by first plugging it into the actual equation, so you can 
plug in infinity and this equation here, and what you would see is, of course, the 
force, if you just solve the math problem goes to zero. 

But you can also look at it qualitatively, so, if you think about the force between the 
electron and the proton, you could just qualitatively think about what's happening. If 
they're close together there's a certain force -- they're attracted because they have 
opposite charges, but as that gets further and further away, that force is going to get 
smaller and smaller, and eventually the force is going to approach zero. 

So, it's a good kind of mental check as we go through this course to remember every 
time there's an equation, usually there's a very good reason for that equation, and 
you can go ahead and just use your qualitative knowledge, you don't have to just 
always stick with the math to check and justify your answers. So, we can get started 
with today's lecture notes. 

And, as I mentioned, we left off and as we started back here to describe the atom 
and how the atom holds together the nucleus and the electron using classical 
mechanics. And today we'll finish that discussion, and, of course, point out actually 
the failure of classical mechanics to appropriately describe what's going on in an 
atom. 

So, then we'll get to turn to a new kind of mechanics or quantum mechanics, which 
will in fact be able to describe what's happening on this very, very small size scale --
so on the atomic size scale on the order of nanometers or angstroms, very small 
particles. And the reason that quantum mechanics is going to work where classical 
mechanics fails is that classical mechanics did not take into account the fact that 
matter has both wave-like and particle-like properties, and light has both wave-like 
and particle-like properties. 

So, we'll take a little bit of a step back after we introduce quantum mechanics, and 
talk about light as a wave, and the characteristic of waves, and then light as a 
particle. And one example of this is in the photoelectric effect. 

So, we just talked about the force law to describe the interaction between a proton 
and an electron. You told me that when the distance went to infinity, the force went 
to zero. What happens instead when the distance goes to zero? What happens to the 
force? 

Yeah. So, the force actually goes to infinity, and specifically it goes to negative 
infinity. Infinity is the force when we're thinking about it and our brains, negative 
infinity is when we actually plug it into the equation here, and the reason is the 
convention that the negative sign is just telling us the direction that the force is 
coming together instead of pushing apart. So, we can use Coulomb's force law to 
think about the force between these two particles -- and it does that, it tells us the 
force is a function of that distance. But what it does not tell us, which if we're trying 
to describe an atom we really want to know, is what happens to the distance as time 
passes? So, r is a function of time. 

But luckily for us, there's a classical equation of motion that will, in fact, describe 
how the electron and nucleus change position or change their radius as a function of 
time. So, that's -- does anyone know which classical law of motion that would be? 

Yup, so it's going to be Newton's second law, force equals mass times acceleration --
those of you that are quick page-turners, have a little one-up on answering that. And 
that tells us force as a function of acceleration, we want to know it though as a 
function of radius, so we can just take the first derivative and get ourselves to 
velocity. So, force is equal to mass times dv  /dt. 

But, of course, we want to go all the way to distance, so we take the second 
derivative and we have this equation for force here. And what we can do in order to 
bring the two equations together, is to plug in the Coulomb force law right here. So, 
now we have our Coulomb force law all plugged in here, and we have this differential 
equation that we could solve, if we wanted to figure out what the force was at 
different times t, or at different positions of r. 

So, all you will have the opportunity to solve differential equations in your math 
courses here. We won't do it in this chemistry course. In later chemistry courses, 
you'll also get to solve differential equations. But instead in this chemistry course, I 
will just tell you the solutions to differential equations. And what we can do is we can 
start with some initial value of r, and here I write r being ten angstroms. That's a 
good approximation when we're talking about atoms, because that's about the size 
of and atom. So, let's say we start off at the distance being ten angstroms. We can 
plug that into this differential equation that we'll have and solve it, and what we find 
out is that r actually goes to zero at a time that's equal to 10 to the negative 10 
seconds. 

So, let's think qualitatively for a second about what that means or what the real 
meaning of that is. What that is telling us is that according to Newtonian mechanics 
and Coulomb's force law, is that the electron should actually plummet into the 
nucleus in 0.1 nanoseconds. 

So, we have a little bit of a problem here. And the problem that we have is that what 
we're figuring out mathematically is not exactly matching up with what we're 
observing experimentally. And, in fact, it's often kind of difficult to experimentally 
test your mathematical predictions -- a lot of people spend many, many years 
testing one single mathematical prediction. But, I think all of us right now can 
probably test this prediction right here, and we're observing that, in fact, all of us 
and all the atoms we can see are not immediately collapsing in less than a 
nanosecond. 

So, just, if you can take what I'm saying for a moment right now that in fact this 
should collapse in this very small time frame, we have to see that there's a problem 
with one of these two things, either the Coulomb force law or Newtonian mechanics. 
So, what do you guys think is probably the issue here? 

So, it's Newtonian mechanics, and the reason for this is because Newtonian 
mechanics does not work on this very, very small size scale. As we said, Newtonian 
mechanics does work in most cases, it does work when we're discussing things that 
we can see, it does work even on things that are too small to measure. But once we 
got to the atomic size scale, what happens is we need to be taking into account the 
fact that matter has these wave-like properties, and we'll learn more about that 
later, but essentially classical mechanics does not take that into account at all. So, 
we need a new kind of mechanics, which is quantum mechanics, which will 
accurately explain the behavior of molecules on this small scale. 

So, as I mentioned, the real key to quantum mechanics is that it's treating matter 
not just like it's a particle, which is what we were just doing, but also like it's a wave, 
and it treats light that way, too. The second important point to quantum mechanics 
is that it actually considers the fact that light consists of these discrete packets or 
particle-like pieces of energy, which are called photons. And if you think about what's 
actually happening here, this second point that light consists of photons is actually 
the same thing as saying that light shows particle-like properties, but that's such an 
important point that I put it separately, and we'll cover that separately as we go 
along. 

So, we now have this new way of thinking about how a nucleus and an electron can 
hang together, and this is quantum mechanics, and we can use this to come up with 
a new way to describe our atom and the behavior of atoms. But the problem is 
before we do this, it makes sense to take a little bit of a step back and actually make 
sure we're all on the same page and understanding why quantum mechanics is so 
important and how it works, and specifically understanding what we mean when we 
say that light is both a particle and a wave, and that matter is both a particle and a 
wave. So, we'll move on to this discussion of light as a wave, and we really won't 
pick up into going back to applying quantum mechanics to the atom until Friday, but 
in the meantime, we'll really get to understand the wave particle duality of light and 
of matter. 

So, we'll start with thinking about some properties of waves that are going to be 
applicable to all waves that we're talking about, including light waves. The easiest 
kind of waves for us to picture are ocean waves or water waves, because we can, in 
fact, see them, but they have similar properties to all waves. And those properties 
include that you have this periodic variation of some property. So, when we're 
talking about water waves, the property we're discussing is just the water level. 

So, for example, we have this average level, and then it can go high where we have 
the peak, or it can go very low. We can also discuss sound waves, so again it's just 
the periodic variation of some property -- in this case we're talking about density, so 
we have high density areas and low density areas. 

So, regardless of the type of wave that we're talking about, there's some common 
definitions that we want to make sure that we're all able to use, and the first is 
amplitude. And when we're talking about the amplitude of the wave, we're talking 
about the deviation from that average level. So, if we define the average level as 
zero, you can have either a positive amplitude or a negative amplitude. So, 
sometimes people get confused when they're solving problems and call the 
amplitude this distance all the way from the max to the min, but it's only half of that 
because we're only going back to the average level. 

So, what we really want to talk about here is light waves, and light waves have the 
same properties as these other kind of waves in that they're the periodic variation of 
some property. So, when we're discussing light waves, what we're talking about is 
actually light or electromagnetic radiation, is what we'll be calling it throughout the 
course. And that's the periodic variation of an electric field. 

So, instead of having the periodic variation of water, or the periodic variation of air 
density, here we're talking about an electric field. We know what an electric field is, 
it's just a space through which a Coulomb force operates. And the important thing to 
think about when you're talking about the fact that it's a periodic variation, is if you 
put a charged particle somewhere into an electric field, it will, of course, go in a 
certain direction toward the charge it's attracted to. But you need to think about the 
difference, if you have a particle here on your wave, it will go in one direction. But 
remember, waves don't just have magnitude, they also do have direction. So, if 
instead you put your particle somewhere down here on the electric field, or on the 
wave, the electric field will now be in the other direction, so your particle will be 
pushed the other way. 

And from physics you know that, of course, if we have a propagating electric field, 
we also have a perpendicular magnetic field that's going back and forth. But in terms 
of worrying about using the concepts of a wave to solve chemistry problems in this 
course, we can actually put aside the fact, and only focus on the electric field part of 
things, because that's what's going to be interacting with our charged particles, such 
as our electrons. 

So, other properties of waves that you probably are all familiar with but I just want 
to review is the idea of a wavelength. If we're talking about the wavelength of a 
wave, we're just talking about the distance that there is between successive 
maxima, or of course, we can also be talking about the distance between successive 
minima. Basically, we can take any point on the wave, and it's the distance to that 
same point later on in the wave. So, that's what we call one wavelength. We also 
commonly discuss the frequency of a wave, and the frequency is just the number of 
cycles that that wave goes through per unit time. So, by a cycle we'd basically mean 
how many times we cycle through a complete wavelength. So, if something cycles 
through five wavelengths in a single second, we would just say that the frequency of 
that wave is five per second. 

We can also mathematically describe what's going on here other than just graphing 
it. So, if we want to look at the mathematical equation of a wave, we want to 

describe -- again as I mention, what we're describing is the electric field, we're not 
worrying about the magnetic field here, as a function of x and t that's equal to a 
cosine [ 2 pi x over wavelength, minus 2 pi nu t ]. And note this is the Greek letter 
nu. This is not a v. Where we have E, which is equal to the electric field, what is x? 

STUDENT: Position. 

PROFESSOR: Yup, the position of the wave. And what about t? Yeah, so we're talking 
about both position and time. So what we can do if we're talking about a wave is 
think of it both in terms of position time, but if we're trying to visualize this -- for 
example if we're actually to graph this out, the easiest thing to do is keep one of 
these two variables constant, either the x or the t, and then just consider the other 
variable. 

So, for example, if we're to hold the time constant, this makes it a lot simpler of an 
equation, because what we can end up doing is actually crossing out this whole term 
here. So what we're left with is just that the electric field as a function of distance is 
a times cosine of the argument there, which is now just 2 pi x over wavelength. So, 
what we want to be able to do, either when we're looking at the graph or looking at 
the equation up there, is to think about different properties of the wave. For 
example, to think about at what point do we have the wave where it's at its 
maximum amplitude? So, if we think about that, we need to have a point where 
we're making this argument of the cosine such that the cosine is going to all be 
equal to one, so all we're left with is that a term. So, we can do that basically any 
time that we have an integer variable that is either zero or an integer variable of the 
wavelength. So, for example, negative wavelength or positive wavelength are two 
times the wavelength, because that lets us cross out the term with the wavelength 
here, and we're left with some integer multiple of just pi. 

So, that's sort of the mathematically how we get to a, but we can also just look at 
the graph here, because every time we go one wavelength, we can see that we're 
back in a maximum. 

So, I mentioned we should be able to figure out where the maximum amplitude is. 
You should also just looking at an equation, immediately be able to figure out what 
that maximum amplitude is in terms of the height of it just by looking at that a-term, 
here we should also be able to know the intensity of any light wave, because 
intensity is just the amplitude squared. So, we should immediately be able to know 
how bright or how intense a light is just looking at the wave equation, or just by 
looking at a graph. 

We can also do a similar thing, and I'll keep my distance from the board, but we can 
instead be holding x constant, for example, putting x to be equal to zero, and then 
all we're doing is considering the electric field as a function of t. So, in this case 
we're crossing out the first term there, and we're left with amplitude times the cosine 
of 2 pi nu times t. And, of course, we can do the same thing again, we can think 
about when the amplitude is going to be at its maximum, and it's going to be any 
time cosine of this term now is equal to one. So that will be at, for example, negative 
1 over nu, or 0, or 1 over nu. And again, we can just look at our graph to figure that 
out, that's exactly where we're at a maximum. 

So, 1 over nu is another term we use and we call it the period of a wave, and the 
period is just the inverse of the frequency. And if we think about frequency, that's 

number of cycles per unit time. So, for example, number of cycles per second, 
whereas the period is how much time it takes for one cycle to occur. 

And when we talk about units of frequency, in almost every case, you'll be talking 
about number of cycles per second. So, you can just write inverse second, the cycle 
part is assumed. But you'll also frequently see it called Hertz, so, Hz here. So, if 
you're talking about five cycles per second, you can write five per second, or you can 
write five Hertz. The one thing you want to keep in mind though is that Hertz does 
not actually mean inverse seconds, it means cycles per second. So, if you're talking 
about a car going so many meters per second, you can't say it's going meter Hertz, 
you have to say meters per second. So, this really just means for frequency, it's a 
frequency label. 

Alright. So, since we have these terms defined, we know the frequency and the 
wavelength, it turns out we can also think about the speed of the wave, and 
specifically of a light wave, and speed and is just equal to the distance that's 
traveled divided by the time the elapsed. And because we've defined these terms, we 
have ways to describe these things. So, we can describe the distance that's traveled, 
it's just a wavelength here. And we can think about how long it takes for a wave, 
because waves are, we know not just changing in position, but the whole wave is 
moving forward with time, we can think about how long it takes for wave to go one 
wavelength. So, one distance that's equal to lambda. So, how much time would that 
take, does anyone know? 

So, would it take, for example, the same amount of time as the frequency? The 
period, that's right. So, it's going to take one period to move that long. And another 
way we can say period is just 1 over nu or 1 over the frequency So, now we know 
both the distance traveled and the time the elapsed. So, we can just plug it in. 
Speed is equal to the distance traveled, which is lambda over the time elapsed, 
which is 1 over nu. so, we can re-write that as speed is equal to lambda times nu, 
and it turns out typically this is reported in meters per second or nanometers per 
second. 

So, now we have an equation where we know the relationship between speed and 
wavelength and frequency, and it turns out that we could take any wave, and as long 
as we know the frequency and the wavelength, we'll be able to figure out the speed. 
But, of course, there's something very special about electromagnetic waves, 
electromagnetic radiation and the speed. And it's not really surprising for me to tell 
you that electromagnetic radiation has a constant speed, and that speed is what we 
call the speed of light, and typically we abbreviate that as c, and that's from the 
Latin term celeritas, which means speed in Latin. That's one of four or five Latin 
words I remember from four years of high school Latin, but it comes in handy to 
remember speed of light. And some of you may have memorized what the speed of 
light is in high school -- it's about 3 times 10 to the 8 meters per second. This is 
another example of a constant that you will accidentally memorize in this course as 
you use it over and over again. But again, that we will supply for you on the exam 
just in case you forget it at that moment. 

And this is a very fast speed, of course, it's about 700 million miles per hour. So, one 
way to put that in perspective is to think about how long it takes for a light beam to 
get from earth to the moon. Does anyone have any guesses? Eight seconds, that 
sounds good. Anyone else? These are all really good guesses, so it actually takes 1.2 
seconds for light to travel from the earth to the moon. So, we're talking pretty fast, 

so that's nice to appreciate in itself. But other than that point, we can also think 
about the fact that frequency and wavelength are related in a way that now since we 
know the speed of light, if we know one we can tell the other. So, you can go ahead 
and switch us to our clicker question here. 

So, we should be able to look at different types of waves and be able to figure out 
something about both their frequency and their wavelength, and know the 
relationship between the two. So, it's up on this screen here now, so we'll work on 
the other one. If you can identify which of these statements is correct based on what 
you know about the relationship between frequency and wavelength and also just 
looking at the waves. 

Alright. So, let's give ten more seconds on that. So, ten seconds on that. Alright. So, 
good job. So, most people could recognize that light wave a has the shorter 
wavelength. We can see that just by looking at the graph itself -- we can see, 
certainly, this is shorter from maxima to maxima. This we can't even see the next 
maxima, so it's much longer. And then, we also know that means that it has the 
higher frequency, because our relationship between wavelength and frequency are 
inversely related. And also, we know the speed of light. So, if we think about if it's a 
shorter wavelength, we'll be able to get a lot more wavelengths in, in a given time, 
than we would for a longer wavelength. 

So, we can switch back to the notes and think about what this means, and what this 
means when we're talking about all the different kinds of light waves we have, and 
I've shown a bunch here, is that if we have the wavelength, we also know the 
frequency of these wavelengths. So, for example, radio waves, which have very long 
wavelengths have very low frequencies. Whereas where we go to waves that have 
very short wavelengths, such a x-rays or cosmic rays, they, in turn, have very high 
frequencies. 

So, it's important to get a little bit of a sense of what all these different kinds of 
lights do. You're absolutely not responsible to memorize what the wavelengths of the 
different types of lights are, but you do want to be able to know the general order of 
them. So, if someone tells you they're using UV light versus x-ray light, you know 
that the x-ray light is, in fact, at a higher frequency. So that's the important take-
away message from this slide. If we think about these different types of lights, 
microwave light, if it's absorbed by a molecule, is a sufficient amount of frequency 
and energy to get those molecules to rotate. That, of course, generates heat, so 
that's how your microwaves work. 

If we talk about infrared light, which is at a higher frequency here and a shorter 
wavelength, infrared light when it's absorbed by molecules actually is enough to 
cause molecules now to vibrate. If we move up to the more high-frequency and 
divisible light and all the way into UV light, if you shine UV light at certain molecules, 
it's going to have enough energy to actually pop those electrons in that molecule up 
to a higher energy level, which will make more sense once we talk about energy 
levels in atoms, but that's what UV light can do. And actually, that's responsible for 
fluorescence and phosphorescence that you see where typically UV light comes in. 
So, if you use a black lamp or something and you excite something up to a higher 
energy level and then it relaxes back down to its lower energy state, it's going to 
emit a new wavelength of light, which is going to be visible to you. 

X-rays are at even a higher frequency, and those are sufficient to actually be 
absorbed by a molecule and pop an electron all the way out of that molecule. You 
can see how that would be damaging to the integrity of that molecule, that's why x-
rays are so damaging -- you don't want to have electrons disappearing for no good 
reason from your molecules that can cause the kind of mutations we don't want to 
be seeing in ourselves. And then also as we go higher, we have gamma rays and 
cosmic rays. 

Within the visible range of what we can see, you also want to know this relative 
order that's pretty easy -- most of us have memorized that in kindergarten, so that 
should be fine. Just remembering that violet is the end that actually has the shortest 
wavelength, which means that it also has, of course, the highest frequency. 

So, just an interesting fact about this set of light, which we're most familiar with, if 
we think about our vision, it turns out that our vision's actually logarithmic and it's 
centered around this green frequency. So, if instead of a red laser pointer here, I 
had a green one, you'd actually, to our eyes, it would seem like the green one was 
brighter, even if the intensity was the same, and that's just because our eyes are 
centered and logarithmic around this green frequency set. 

So, using the relationship between frequency and wavelength, we can actually 
understand a lot about what's going on, and pretty soon we'll also draw the 
relationship very soon to energy, so it will be even more informative then. But I just 
want to point out one of the many, many groups at MIT that works with different 
fluorescing types of molecules, and this is Professor Bawendi's laboratory at MIT, and 
he works with quantum dots. And quantum dots are these just very tiny, tiny 
crystals of semiconductor material. They're on the order of one to ten nanometers, 
and these can be shined on with UV light -- they have a lot of different interesting 
properties, but one I'll mention is that if you excite them with UV light, they will have 
some of the electrons move to a higher energy state, and when they drop back 
down, they actually emit light with a wavelength that corresponds with the size of 
the actual quantum dot. 

So, from what we know so far, we should be able to look at any of these quantum 
dots, which are depicted as a cartoon here, but here we have an actual picture of the 
quantum dots suspended in some sort of solution and shone on with UV light, and 
you can see that you can achieve this whole beautiful range of colors just by 
modulating the size of the different dots. And we should be able to know if we're 
looking at a red dot -- is a red dot, it's going to have a longer wavelength, so is this 
a higher or lower frequency? Yeah, and similarly, if someone tells us that their dot is 
blue-shifted, that should automatically in our heads tell us, oh it shifted to a higher 
frequency. 

And these dots are really interesting in that you can, I'm sure by looking at this 
picture, already imagine just a whole slew of different biological or sensing 
applications that you could think of. For example, if you were trying to study 
different protein interactions, you could think about labeling them with different 
colored dots, or there's also a bunch of different fluorescent techniques that you 
could apply using these dots, or you could think of in-vivo sensing, how useful these 
could be if you could think of a way to get them into your body without being too 
toxic, for example. 

These are all things that the Bawendi group is working on. What they are real 
experts in is synthesizing many different kinds of these dots, and they have a 
synthetic scheme that's used by research groups around the world. The Bawendi 
group also collaborates with people, both at different schools and at MIT. One 
example, on some of their biochemistry applications is with another Professor at MIT, 
Alice Ting and her lab. 

So really what I want to point out here is as we get more into describing quantum 
mechanics, these quantum dots are one really good example where a lot of the 
properties of quantum mechanics apply directly. So, if you're interested, I put the 
Bawendi lab research website onto your notes. And also, Professor Bawendi recently 
did an interview with "The Tech." Did anyone see that interview in the paper? So, 
three or four -- a few of you read the paper last week. So, you can either pick up an 
old issue or I put the link on the website, too. And that's not just about his research, 
it's also about some of his memories as a student and advice to all of you. So, it's 
interesting to read and get to know some of these Professors at MIT a little bit 
better. 

So, one property that was important we talked about with waves is the relationship 
between frequency and wavelength. Another very important property of waves that's 
true of all waves, is that you can have superposition or interference between two 
waves. So, if we're looking at waves and they're in-phase, and when I talk about in-
phase, what I mean is that they're lined up, so that the maxima are in the same 
position and the minima are in the same position, what we can have a something 
called constructive interference. And all we mean by constructive interference is that 
literally those two waves add together, such as the maxima are now twice as high, 
and the minima are now twice as low. 

So, you can also imagine a situation where instead of being perfectly lined up, now 
we have the minima being lined up with the maxima here. So, if we switch over to a 
clicker question maybe on this screen -- okay, can it be done up there to switch? So, 
we're still settling in with the renovations here in this room. So, why don't you all go 
ahead and tell me what happens if you combine these two waves, which are now out 
of phase? 

So, let's -- okay, so, why don't you all think about would happen -- we'll start with 
the thought exercise. You can switch back to my lecture notes then if this isn't going. 
Alright. So, hopefully what everyone came up with is the straight line, is that what 
you answered? 

STUDENT: Yeah. 

PROFESSOR: OK, very good. And I didn't make you try to draw the added, the 
superimposed positive construction in your notes, but I think everyone can handle 
drawing a straight line. So, you can go ahead and draw what happens when we have 
destructive interference. And destructive interference, of course, is the extreme, but 
you can picture also a case where you have waves that are not quite lined up, but 
they're also not completely out of phase. So in that case, you're either going to have 
the wave get a little bigger, but not twice as big or a little bit smaller. 

So, I think the easiest way to think about interference is not actually with light, but 
sometimes it's easiest to think about with sound, especially when you're dealing with 
times where you have destructive interference. Has anyone here ever been in a 

concert hall where they feel like they're kind of in a dead spot, or you don't quite 
hear as well, and if you move down just two seats all of a sudden it's just blasting at 
you -- hopefully not in this room. But have people experienced that before? Yeah, I 
definitely experienced it, too. And really, all you're experiencing there is destructive 
interference in a very bad way. Halls, they try to design halls such that that doesn't 
happen, and I show an example of a concert hall here -- this is Symphony Hall in 
Boston, and I can pretty much guarantee you if you do go to this Symphony Hall, 
you will not experience a bad seat or a dead seat. This is described as actually one of 
the top two or three acoustic concert halls in the whole world. So, it's very well 
designed such that they've minimized any of these destructive interference dead 
sounds. So, it's nice, on a student budget you can go and get the worst seat in the 
house and you can hear just as well as they can hear up front, even if you can't 
actually see what's going on. 

So, another example of destructive interference is just with the Bose headphones. 
I've never actually tried these on, but you see people with them, and what happens 
here is it's supposed to be those noise cancellation headphones. All they do is they 
take in the ambient noise that's around it, and there's actually battery in the 
headphones, that then produces waves that are going to destructively interfere with 
that ambient noise. And that's how it actually gets to be so quiet when you have on, 
supposedly, these quite expensive headphones. 

So, that's light as a wave, and the reason -- well, that was sound as a wave, but 
light as a wave is the same idea. And it was really established by the early 1900s 
that, in fact, light behaved as a wave. And the reason that it was so certain that light 
was a wave was because we could observe these things -- we could see, for 
example, that light defracted, and we could see that light constructively or 
destructively could interfere with other light waves, and this was all confirmed and 
visualized. But also, around the time that Thomson was discovering the electron, 
there were some other observations that were going on, and the most disturbing to 
kind of the understanding of the universe was the fact that there were some 
observations about light that didn't make sense with this idea that light is a particle. 
And the photoelectric effect is maybe the most clear example of this. 

So, the photoelectric effect is the effect that if you have some metal, and you can 
pick essentially any metal you want, and you shine light of a certain frequency onto 
that metal, you can actually pop off an electron, and you can go ahead and measure 
what the kinetic energy of that electron that comes off is, because we can measure 
the velocity and we know that kinetic energy equals 1/2 m b squared, and thanks to 
Thomson we also know the mass of an electron. 

So, this is an interesting observation, and in itself not too disturbing, yet but the 
important thing to point out is that there's this threshold frequency that is of the 
metal, and each metal has a different threshold frequency, such as if you shine light 
on the metal where the frequency of the light is less than the threshold frequency, 
nothing will happen -- no electron will pop off of that metal. However, if you shine a 
light with a frequency that's greater than the threshold frequency, you will be able to 
pop off an electron. 

So, people were making this observation, but this wasn't making any sense at all 
because there was nothing in classical physics that described any sort of relationship 
between the frequency of light and the energy, much less the energy of an electron 
that would get popped off of a metal that would basically come off only when we're 

hitting this threshold frequency. So, what they could do was actually graph what was 
happening here, so we can also graph what was happening, and what they found 
was that if we were at any point below the threshold frequency and we were 
counting the numbers of electrons that were popping off of our metal, we weren't 
seeing anything at all. But if you go up the threshold frequency, suddenly you see 
that there's some number of electrons that comes off, and amazingly, the number of 
electrons actually had no relationship at all to the frequency of the light. 

And this didn't make a lot of sense to people at the time because they thought that 
the frequency should be related to the number of electrons that are coming off, 
because you have more frequency coming in, you'd expect more electrons that are 
coming off -- this wasn't what people were seeing. So, what they decided to do is 
just study absolutely everything they could about the photoelectric effect and hope, 
at some point, someone would piece something together that could explain what's 
going on or shed some light on this effect. 

So, one thing they did, because it was so easy to measure kinetic energy of 
electrons, is plot the frequency of the light against the kinetic energy of the electron 
that's coming off here. And in your notes and on these slides here, just for your 
reference, I'm just pointing out what's going to be predicted from classical physics. 
You're not responsible for that and we won't really discuss it, but it just gives you the 
contrast of the surprise that comes up when people make these observations. And 
the first observation was that the frequency of the light had a linear relationship to 
the kinetic energy of the electrons that are ejected here. This made no sense at all to 
people, and again they saw this effect where if you were below that threshold 
frequency, you saw nothing at all. 

So, that was frequency with kinetic energy. The next thing that they wanted to look 
at was the actual intensity of the light and see what the relationship of intensity to 
kinetic energy is. So, what we would expect is that there is a relationship between 
intensity in kinetic energy, because it was understood that however intense the light 
was, if you had a more intense light, it was a higher energy light beam. So that 
should mean that the energy that's transferred to the electron should be greater, but 
that's not what you saw at all, and what you saw is that if you kept the frequency 
constant, there was absolutely no change in the kinetic energy of the electrons, no 
matter how high up you had the intensity of the light go. You could keep increasing 
the intensity and nothing was going to happen. 

So, we could also plot the number of electrons that are ejected as a relationship to 
the intensity, so that was yet another experiment they could do. And this is what 
they had expected that there would be no relationship, but instead here they saw 
that there was a linear relationship not to the intensity and the kinetic energy of the 
electrons, but to the intensity and the number of electrons. 

So, none of these observations made sense to any scientists at the time, and really 
all of these observations were made and somewhat put aside for several years 
before someone that could kind of process everything that was going on at once 
came along, and that person was Einstein, conveniently enough -- if anyone could 
put it together, we would hope that he could, and he did. And what he did in a way 
that made sense when all of us look at it, is he plotted all of these different metals 
on the same graph and made some observations. So, for example, here we're 
showing rubidium and potassium and sodium plotted where we're plotting the 

frequency -- that's the frequency of that light that's coming into the metal versus the 
kinetic energy of the electron that's ejected from the surface of the metal. 

And what he found here, which is what you can see and we can all see pretty clearly, 
is the slope of all of these lines is the same regardless of what the type of metal is. 
So, he fit all these to the equation of the line, and what he noticed was the slope was 
specifically this number, 6.626 times 10 to the negative 34, joules times seconds. 
And he also found that the y intercept for each one of these metals was equal to 
basically this number here, which was the slope times the minimum frequency 
required of each specific metal, so that's of the threshold frequency. 

And he actually knew that this number had popped up before, and a lot of you are 
familiar with this number also, and this is Planck's constant. Planck had observed this 
number as a fitting constant years earlier when he looked at some phenomena, and 
you can read about in your book, such as black body radiation. And what he found 
was he needed this constant to fit his data to what was observed. And this is the 
same thing that Einstein was observing, that he needed this fitting constant, that this 
constant was just falling right out of, for example, this slope and also the y intercept. 
So he decided to go ahead and define exactly what it is, this line, in terms of these 
new constants, this constant he's calling h, which is Planck's constant. So, on the y 
axis we have kinetic energy, so we can plug that in. If we talk about what the x axis 
is, that's just the frequency of the light that's coming in. We know what m is, m is 
equal to h. And then we can plug in what b is, the y intercept, because that's just the 
negative of h times that threshold frequency. 

So we have this new equation here when we're considering this photoelectric effect, 
which is that the kinetic energy is equal to h nu minus h nu threshold of the metal. 
And what Einstein concluded and observed is that well, kinetic energy, of course, 
that's an energy term, and h times nu, well that has to be energy also, because 
energy has to be equal to energy -- there's no other way about it. And this worked 
out with units as well because we're talking about joules for kinetic energy, and 
when we're talking about h times nu, we're talking about joules times second times 
inverse seconds. So, the very important conclusion that Einstein made here is that 
energy is equal to h times nu, or that h times nu is an actual energy term. 

And this kind of went along with two observations. The first is that energy of a 
photon is proportional to its frequency. So this was never recognized before that if 
we know the frequency of a photon or a wave of light, we can know the energy of 
that light. So, since we know that there's relationship also between frequency and 
wavelength, we can do the same thing -- if we know the wavelength, we can know 
the energy of the light. 

And I use the term photon here, and that's because he also concluded that light 
must be made up of these energy packets, and each packet has that h, that Planck's 
constant's worth of energy in it, so that's why you have to multiply Planck's constant 
times the frequency. Any frequency can't have an energy, you have to -- you don't 
have a continuum of frequencies that are of a certain energy, it's actually punctuated 
into these packets that are called photons. And, as you know, Einstein made many, 
many, many very important contributions to science and relativity, but he called this 
his one single most important contribution to science, the relationship between 
energy and frequency and the idea of photons. 

So this means we now have a new way of thinking about the photoelectric effect, 
and that is the idea that h times nu is actually an energy. So, it's the energy of an 
incident photon if we're talking about nu where we're talking about the energy of the 
photon going in, so we can abbreviate that as e sub i, energy of the incident photon. 
We can talk about also h times nu nought, which is that threshold frequency. So this 
is a term we're going to see a lot, especially in your problem sets, it's called the work 
function, and the work function is the same thing as the threshold frequency of a 
metal, except, of course, that it's multiplied by Planck's constant. So, it's the 
minimum energy that a certain metal requires in order to pop a photon out of it -- in 
order to eject an electron from the surface of that metal. 

So this is our new kind of schematic way that we can think about looking at the 
photoelectric effect, so if this is the total amount of energy that we put into the 
system, where here we have the energy of a free electron. We have this much 
energy going in, the metal itself requires this much energy, the work function, in 
order to eject an electron. So that much energy is going to be used up just ejecting 
it. And what we have left over is this amount of energy here, which is going to be the 
kinetic energy of the ejected electron. 

So, therefore, we can rewrite our equation in two ways. One is just talking about it in 
terms only of energy where our kinetic energy here is going to be equal to the total 
energy going in -- the energy initial minus this energy of the work function here. We 
can also talk about it in terms of if we want to solve, if we, for example, we want to 
find out what that initial energy was, we can just rearrange our equation, or we can 
look at this here where the initial energy is equal to kinetic energy plus the work 
function. 

So before we go we'll try to see if we can do a clicker question for you on this, and 
we can, very good. So, everyone take those clickers back out and tell me, if a beam 
of light with a certain energy, and we're going to say four electron volts strikes a 
gold surface, and here we're saying that the gold surface has a work function of 5.1 
electron volts, what is the maximum kinetic energy of the electron that is ejected? 

So why don't you go ahead and take ten seconds on that. And if you don't know, 
that's okay, just type in an answer and give it your best shot. And let's see what we 
come up with here. Alright. So, it looks like some of you were tricked, but many of 
you were not, so no electrons will be ejected. The reason for that is because this is 
the minimum amount of energy -- hold off a sec on the packing up, so in case 
someone doesn't understand -- this is the minimum amount of energy that's 
required from the energy going in in order to eject an electron. So if the incident 
energy is less than the energy that's required, absolutely nothing will happen. That's 
the same thing we were talking about with threshold frequency. 

All right, now you can pack up and we'll see you on Wednesday.
