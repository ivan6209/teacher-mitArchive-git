***** Research Scope and Background: The Systems *****
Individual research projects in the Microbial Genetics Project Lab, during the
Fall semester of 2003, focused on various species of Rhodococcus. Many bacteria
within this genus can metabolize (break down) environmental pollutants and/or
convert them to useful chiral molecules. These bacteria can also produce a wide
range of useful molecules, including industrial chemicals (providing a "green
chemistry" approach to their manufacture), and secondary metabolites such as
antibiotics. StudentsÂ were invited to explore how genes contribute to the
useful properties of these bacteria.
***** Overview *****
The course consists of these three key components: lab work, oral
presentations, and scientific writing. Since communication is an especially
important component of scientific research, this course aims to improve your
written and oral communication skills. Research activities "at the bench"
occupy the bulk of your time; however, you are also responsible for making oral
presentations to the class and for writing up your research results in a format
suitable for publication in international scientific journals.
***** Laboratory *****
In this course, the teaching staff presents to you a series of questions that
currently face the microbiology community. The instructors and teaching
assistants then work with you to design a research strategy for answering these
questions. Throughout the semester the staff coaches you through your work
individually, helping you to design individual experiments, interpret your
results, and to overcome technical challenges.
***** Oral Presentations *****
To foster the development of strong communication skills, you are required to
make at least two formal oral presentations to the class during the semester.
Students frequently use overhead projectors, Powerpoint presentations and/or
other visual aids for these talks.
**** Presentation One: Journal Club ****
The first of these presentations will be in the form of a "journal club" In
these presentations, you will read and report on articles from the primary
research literature. The teaching staff will help you to identify 3-4 journal
articles for this purpose that are relevant to your area of research. During
the presentations, you will provide background information on the subject of
the paper, providing context for the research to be described and explaining
the questions that were addressed in the paper. You will describe the series of
experiments described in the papers and show how the data were interpreted,
presenting the authors' conclusions while commenting on the strengths and
weaknesses of the papers. You are expected to describe the papers in such a way
that they "tell the story" of how research in that particular field has evolved
recently.
**** Presentation Two: Progress Report ****
The second formal presentation will be in the form of a "progress report,"
during which you will present to your classmates a synopsis of your own
research activities. In these presentations, you are asked to describe the
background of your research area, keeping in mind that not all of your
classmates will be familiar with each other's specific projects. You will then
describe your own experiments and whatever data you have collected to that
point, interpreting your results as you go. You are also encouraged to discuss
problems that you have encountered during your research, as well as your ideas
for how to proceed in the future.
As with all aspects of this course, you are encouraged to discuss your ideas
with the teaching staff as you prepare for your presentations. The staff also
welcomes any requests for comments and feedback on your individual
presentations.
***** Writing Requirements *****
Written communication has been the standard for disseminating scientific
achievements and new knowledge for centuries. A lack of good writing skills
would be a severe handicap for any scientist, regardless of skill at the bench.
For this reason, students in Microbial Genetics Project Lab are required to
take on a number of writing activities, culminating in a final paper that
describes your own research.
In preparation for this final paper, you will complete two or three
intermediate writing assignments, each of which will focus on the format and
content of a specific portion of your final paper. Thus, the first of these
assignments will likely focus on writing an Introduction. The next may focus on
writing a Results section or a Materials and Methods section. The Writing
Instructor and the rest of the teaching staff will coach you through these
activities.
The final papers are written in the same format that microbiologists use
throughout the world for publishing their own research results. Each paper is
expected to contain:
    * An introduction explaining the background and significance of your
      research area, reviewing the relevant literature and clearly stating the
      goals of the research to be described.
    * Next, you will describe the experiments that were carried out and the
      data you collected in a 'Results' section. You will describe many of the
      procedural details of the experiments, however, in a separate section of
      the paper, entitled 'Materials and Methods,' which is often placed before
      the 'Results' section in a formal paper.
    * This will be followed by a (hopefully) insightful discussion, in which
      you interpret your data, formulate models to explain your observations,
      and relate your own work to that of other researchers in the broader
      scientific community.
***** Grading Policy *****
Grading in this course is based on your performance in the areas summarized
below.
Although students in this course typically work in groups of two, individual
students are graded independently.
                    Grading criteria.
ACTIVITY                                       PERCENTAGE
Research Progress, Skill, Effort and Notebooks 40%
Lab Meetings and Oral Presentations            20%
Three interim writing assignments              5% each
Final Paper                                    25%
The most important theme in grading this course is whether you demonstrate an
understanding and appreciation of the material in question.
    * In the lab, do you understand why and how each experiment is being
      carried out?
    * During oral presentations, have you carefully thought about the subject
      being presented and its implications
    * Does your final paper demonstrate an understanding of not only the
      specific research project, but also how it fits into the greater body of
      knowledge in the scientific literature as a whole?
***** Progress, Skill, Effort, and Lab Notebooks (40%) *****
40% of the final grade will be based on how you perform in the laboratory. You
do not necessarily have to complete your assigned research project, but you do
need to demonstrate a basic level of competence and a genuine effort to extend
the research as far as possible. Not everyone enters this course with the same
level of laboratory research experience. The staff recognizes this and
encourages you to "make the most" of your own skills. Your effort to expand
your knowledge beyond the immediate need of the experimentation will be
reflected favorably in this portion of the grade.
Also, you are expected to demonstrate good "team effort" -- working with your
teammates to move the project forward. Everyone is expected to carry his or her
share of the burden.
**** The Lab Notebook ****
In addition, you must keep a lab notebook. The notebook is very important as it
is key to good experimental practice. Each lab partner should keep his or her
own notebook, which will eventually contain all the data collected by the whole
team. In this way each partner can consider the results independently.
Refer to the Lab_Notebook_Guidelines_and_RecommendationsÂ for specific
information on how to use, keep, and maintain a viable lab notebook.
It is worth noting that the teaching staff is available, in part, to help you
debug your experiments. Not being able to describe precisely what was done will
make this task very difficult. The TAs will check the notebooks for
completeness periodically. They must be current. You are responsible for having
your previous day's entries completed every day.
Depending on the progress you make in your research project, future Project Lab
students, UROPs, or graduate students may one day wish to pick up where you
left off, trying to extend your findings even further. Alternatively, future
researchers may be interested to learn how you solved a specific technical
problem, how you carried out a certain experiment, or what protocol you used
for a given assay. In any of these cases, scientists would need access to your
lab notebook. To make this possible, you should plan on turning in your
notebook (or a good photocopy of it) to the professor at the end of the
semester.
**** Lab Hours and Attendance ****
You are expected to attend class every day during regular lab hours, 1 p.m. - 5
p.m.
You will receive a lower grade in this class if you do not show up on time. In
the event of an emergency or illness, you must contact the Instructor or one of
the TAs.
You may wish to stay after 5 p.m. on occasion. The TAs will stick around for a
while after 5 p.m. so that students may complete the day's experiments.
However, the TAs will not look favorably upon you if you need to work late
because you did not arrive on time or wasted time during the normal hours.
Occasionally you may want come to the lab on weekends. Working in the lab at
odd hours can be done, but only at the discretion of the TAs. The TAs will
notify you of the hours when one of them will be in the lab. Under no
circumstances will you be allowed to work in the lab when no member of the
teaching staff is present.
***** Lab Meetings and Oral Presentations (20%) *****
On Monday and Friday of every week we will begin class with a group meeting in
the afternoon. During this lab meeting we will discuss issues of general
concern, explain protocols and strategies, and you will have the opportunity to
hone your presentation skills through progress reports, journal clubs and other
presentations.
For a journal club you will be asked to read papers from the primary literature
that deal with a relevant topic. During the session we will discuss important
issues raised by the papers, and come up with new experiments to address the
problem.
You will also be asked to carry out a literature search dealing with your
specific research projects early in the semester. The purpose of this exercise
is:
    * To ensure that you have a firm understanding of the background,
      principles and issues surrounding your projects
    * To ensure that you gain experience in research-related literature
      searches
    * To spark your creativity in finding alternate strategies to achieve your
      goals or to uncover new and interesting approaches to the central
      questions in each project, and
    * To give you an opportunity to improve your presentation skills while
      working as part of a team.
Each group will also have ample opportunity to discuss your work with the
entire class in lab meetings. We will discuss progress as a group and address
common problems that arise.
Grades for the oral presentations will be based on your demonstration of a firm
understanding of the subject in question, the clarity of the presentation, and
the mechanics of the presentation itself (use of visual aids, speaking style,
etc.).
***** Final Paper (25%) *****
You must submit a paper by the end of the term, describing the progress and
results of your experiments in this course.
This paper should demonstrate a strong level of understanding of the topic
researched during the semester, and should be based upon experimental data. It
need not be an exhaustive description of everything that was done or attempted
during the semester.
The best papers frequently discuss only two or three key experiments that
occurred during the semester. For more information, see the description of
"Writing Requirement" for this course. The paper must be turned in on time, in
ses# 64. Late papers will be marked down.
Grades for the final paper will be based on your demonstration of a firm
understanding of the subject in question, the clarity of the writing, and the
mechanics of the presentation itself (use of figures, writing style, reference
to published research, etc.).
