Notes  for  Recitation  17 

The  Four-Step  Method 

This  is  a  good  approach  to  questions  of  the  form,  “What  is  the  probability  that  ——?” 
Intuition  wil l  mislead  you,  but  this  formal  approach  gives  the  right  answer  every  time. 

1.  Find  the  sample  space.  (Use  a  tree  diagram.) 

2.  Deﬁne  events  of  interest.  (Mark  leaves  corresponding  to  these  events.) 

3.  Determine  outcome  probabilities: 

(a)  Assign  edge  probabilities. 
(b)  Compute  outcome  probabilities.  (Multiply  along  root-to-leaf  paths.) 

4.  Compute  event  probabilities.  (Sum  the  probabilities  of  all  outcomes  in  the  event.)

1  The  Four-Door  Deal 

2 

Suppose  that  Let’s  Make  a  Deal  is  played  according  to  diﬀerent  rules.  Now  there  are  four 
doors,  with  a  prize  hidden  behind  one  of  them.  The  contestant  is  allowed  to  pick  a  door. 
The  host  must  then  reveal  a  diﬀerent  door  that  has  no  prize  behind  it.  The  contestant  is 
allowed  to  stay  with  his  or  her  original  door  or  to  pick  one  of  the  other  two  that  are  still 
closed.  If  the  contestant  chooses  the  door  concealing  the  prize  in  this  second  stage,  then  he 
or  she  wins. 

1.  Contestant Stu, a sanitation engineer from Trenton, New Jersey, stays with his original 
door.  What  is  the  probability  that  he  wins  the  prize?

The  tree  diagram  is  awkwardly  large.  This  often  happens;  in  fact,  sometimes  you’ll

encounter  inﬁnite  tree  diagrams!  Try  to  draw  enough  of  the  diagram  so  that  you

understand  the  structure  of  the  remainder.


Solution.  Let’s make  the  following  assumptions: 

(a)  The  prize  is  equally  likely  to  be  behind  each  door. 
(b)  The contestant is equally likely to pick each door initially, regardless of the prize’s 
location. 
(c)  The  host  is  equally  likely  to  reveal  each  door  that  does  not  conceal  the  prize  and 
was  not  selected  by  the  player. 

A partial  tree diagram  is  shown below.  The  remaining  subtrees  are  symmetric  to  the 
full-expanded  subtree.

2  Earliest  Door 

4 

Let’s  consider  another  variation  of  the  four-doors  problem.  Say  the  doors  are  labeled  A,  B, 
C,  and D.  Suppose  that Carol  always  opens  the  earliest  door  possible  (the  door whose  label 
is earliest  in the alphabet) with the restriction that she can neither reveal the prize nor open 
the  door  that  the  player  picked. 

This  gives  contestant  Mergatroid—  an  engineering  student  from  Cambridge,  MA—  just 
a  little  more  information  about  the  location  of  the  prize.  Suppose  that  Mergatroid  always 
switches  to  the  earliest  door,  excluding  his  initial  pick  and  the  one  Carol  opened.  What  is 
the  probability  that  he  wins  the  prize? 

Solution.  A  tree  diagram  is  worked  out  below. 

The  probability  that Mergatroid  wins  is:

3  The  3  doors  version  revisited 

3.1  Carol  picks  the  smallest  door 

5 

Suppose we  are  in  the  original  game  show with  3 doors.  In  our original  analysis we assumed 
Carol  picked  the  door  randomly.  In  this  case  suppose  Carol  picks  the  smallest  door,  while 
still  making  sure  of  both  i)  it  contains  a  goat  and  ii)  it  is  not  the  contestants  ﬁrst  choice. 
The  contestant  follows  the  switching  strategy.  What  is  the  probability  the  contestant wins? 

Solution.  A  tree  diagram  is  worked  out  below. 

Recitation  17 

6 

Hence  the  probability  of  winning  using  the  switch  strategy  is  2/3,  even  when  Carol  picks 
the  earliest  door  possible.  This  is  also  the  case  using Mergatroid’s  strategy  of  switching  to 
the  leftmost option.  There  is always only one option  left over,  so only one option  to  switch 
to  anyway.  Contrast  this  to  the  4  door  case  worked  out  before.

3.2  Carol  picks  the  smallest  door  with  probability  p 

This  time,  when  Carol  has  a  choice  she  chooses  the  smallest  possible  door  with  probability 
p  and  the  other  remaining  door  with  probability  1 −  p.  The  contestant  still  follows  the 
switching  strategy.  What  is  the  probability  the  contestant  wins,  in  terms  of  p? 

Solution.  Observe  the  tree  diagram  below: 

Recitation  17

Therefore  the  probability  remains  2/3.  Notice  the  parameter  p  has  no  eﬀect  in  the  ﬁnal 
formula, because if the contestant plays the “always switch” strategy then she will invariably 
lose  in  those  situations  where  Carol  has  the  option  to  choose  among  two  doors.  In  the 
solution  we  could  even  allow  the  parameters  p,  q ,  and  r  rather  than  a  single  p,  allowing 
Carol  pick  them  separately,  it  would  still make  no  diﬀerence.

To  analyze  the  original Monty  Hall  problem,  we made  the  assumption  “Carol  picks  one  of 
the  remaining  doors  equally  at  random”,  but  from  the  two  previous  problems  we  can  see 
this  assumption  was  not  needed  in  order  to  conclude  switching  wins more  than  half  of  the 
time.

3.3  Optimal  strategery 

10 

So  far  we  assumed  the  contestant  always  switches,  and  analyzed  the  outcome  of  the  game 
that  way.  In  lecture  we  also  discussed  the  strategy  of  always  sticking  to  the  original  choice. 
We determined that the probability of winning with the “always stay”  is  larger than the one 
of  winning  with  an  “always  switch”  strategy,  in  fact  they  are  complementary. 

But,  what  if  the  contestant  decides  whether  to  switch  or  not  on  a  case  by  case  basis? 
That  is,  suppose  the  contestant  makes  a  decision  on  whether  to  switch  or  to  stay  based  on 
1)  Her  original  choice,  and  2)  Carol’s  choice  of  door. 

Suppose the doors are  labelled A, B and C. Show “always switching”  is optimal.  (Hint:  a 
strategy  can be  seen as a mapping  that assigns a pair  (D1 , D2 ) of observations  to a decision: 
switch  to D3  or  stay  in D1 .  The  strategy needs  to be deﬁned  for  all pairs  (A, B ),  (A, C ) · · · . 
You  can  optimize  the  reaction  for  each  potential  observation  individually.) 

Solution.  Suppose  without  losing  generality  the  contestant  picks  door  A  and  is  shown 
door  B .  He  must  decide  on  the  basis  of  this  information  whether  to  switch  to  door  C  or 
stay  in  A.  Picking  A  and  observing  B  is  consistent  with  the  prize  being  behind  A  or  C . 
As  the  tree  diagram  shows,  we  are  only  dealing  with  a  subgraph  of  the  full  tree: 

Recitation  17 

11 

The  diagram  indicates  Carol  picks  one  door  with  probability  p,  and  the  other  with  proba­
bility  1 − p when  she  has  a  choice.  The  contestant  has  a  strategy  summarized  of  switching 
with probablity q .  When q = 1 we mean she will stay, when q = 0 we mean she will switch. 

The  total  probability  of  winning  will  include  two  contributions  from  the  two  illustrated 

ABCAABBprize's locationplayer's   initial choicedoor openedplayerwins?pprobabilityXXplayerpicksC /1 - qA / qC /1 - qA / qpq/9(1 - q)/9Recitation  17 
12 
branches,  for  a  total  of  (pq + 1 − q)/9.  For  a  given  p,  if  the  contestant  decides  to  move 
q  to  0,  the  contribution  becomes  1/9.  If  the  contestant  moves  q  towards  1,  she  gets  a 
contribution  of  p/9.  Since  p ≤ 1,  then  switching will  at worst  be  as  good.  Notice  also  that 
any  other  value  of  q  in  between  0  and  1  will  not  be  optimal  (since  it  is  an  average  of  the 
two  extremes).  Hence,  having  q = 0  is  the  best  choice,  no matter  what  p  is. 

In  this  way,  the  contestant  can  optimize  her  choice  for  every  possible  pair  of  observations. 
By  symmetry  you  can  see  the  answers will  be  the  same:  switch.  Hence  the  overall  optimal 
strategy is “always switch”.  This result is actually a little stronger than what was suggested 
in  the  problem,  in  which  you  were  only  asked  to  consider  the  extreme  values  of  q  = 1  and 
q = 0. 

Contrast this with the 4 door version of the problem, where Mergatroid has a strategy that 
� 
performs  better  than  switching.
