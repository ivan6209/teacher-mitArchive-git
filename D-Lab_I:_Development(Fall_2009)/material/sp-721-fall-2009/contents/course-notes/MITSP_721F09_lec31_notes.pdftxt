Presentation by José Gómez-Márquez: 
José  Gómez-Márquez  co-teaches  D-Lab:  Health  and  leads  the  Innovations  in  International 
Health  (IIH)  initiative  at  MIT.  Among  the  projects  under  his  technology  practice  at  IIH  are  the 
Aerovax  Drug  Delivery  System,  a  device  for  mass  delivery  of  inhalable  drugs  and  vaccines  to 
remote populations, SafePilot, a next generation cane for the blind, and XoutTB program, which 
aims  to  increase  TB  therapy  adherence  in  developing  countries  using  novel  diagnostics  and 
mobile  technology.  Originally  from  Honduras,  José  worked  in  institutional  investments  and 
international  development  before  attending  Worcester  Polytechnic  Institute  as  a  mid-career 
student, where he  focused on policy  research studies covering  international  technology  transfer 
and  small  team  innovation.  José  is  a  3-time  MIT  IDEAS  Competition  winner,  including  two 
Lemelson  Awards  for  International  Technology,  and  was  named  Humanitarian  of  the  Year  as 
one of Technology Review’s 35 top innovators under 35. 

Looking at  tropical diseases and neglected diseases, what has cropped up  in  the  last 5-6 years 
is  like an undefined notion of Web 2.0  (Facebook, etc.): global health encompasses  issues  that 
transcend  national  boundaries  and  are  better  addressed  through  information  sharing,  user-
centric design and  collaborative problem  solving. There are 2 main  lines of  interest  in  this  field: 
public  health  and  humanitarian  aid.  You  can  think  of  public  health  as  the  large  centralized 
infrastructure  that  keeps  the  overall  population  healthy  (vaccination  programs,  awareness 
campaigns,  clinics,  Ministry  of  Health,  World  Health  Organization,  etc.).  Humanitarian  aid  is 
disaster  response  medicine  to  protect  dignity  and  alleviate  suffering  (Hurricane  Katrina 
evacuation program, refugee programs, etc.). It  is  important to recognize that we can learn from 
everyday situations in Uganda to know how to deal with situations like a major natural disaster. 

The  South-North  distribution  of  life  expectancy  is  very 
uneven  (esp.  in  Africa  and  South  East  Asia),  but  there  is 
a more  interesting measure  of  not  only  how  long  did  that 
person  live,  but  how  productive  they  were  and  how  they 
were  able  to  provide  for  their  families.  This  unit  is  called 
the  Disability  Adjusted  Life  Years  (DALY),  which  gives 
you a  sum of potential  life  lost due  to premature mortality 
and  productive  life  lost  due  to  disability.  Life  expectancy 
alone  wouldn't  take  into  account  the  quality  of  life  of  a 
polio  survivor  who's  in  a  wheelchair  until  85.  Generally 
people die from diseases like heart disease, but what they 
suffer from in their life tends to be a different set of diseases, like respiratory infections, diarrheal 
diseases, and depression. This gives us a clearer view of opportunities to impact global health.

If you use http://worldmapper.org to look at health expenditures, you can see that much more is 
spent in the US and Europe, East Asia. The key is not only what you spend, however, but what 
you get. This map may actually end up showing a lot of waste. Still, the disparity in spending is 
shocking – only 1% of new drugs developed during 1975-1999 were for tropical diseases. For 
example, river blindness does not happen in the US. Who will pay for a river blindness drug? 
What's the incentive? 

There  are  dual-use  opportunities  for medical  innovations  in  global  health. For  example, military 
and camping uses  for medical equipment have  the same parameters as what you would design 
for in the developing world (lack of infrastructure, etc.). For medicine, pharmaceuticals can price 
drugs  differently  in  developed  and  developing world  so  they  can  charge  enough  to  recover  the 
costs  of  development  while  trying  to  keep  the  cost  at  an  affordable  rate  in  other  countries. 
What's  happening  now,  however,  is  that  the  emerging  pharmaceuticals  in  Brazil,  India,  and 
South  Africa  can  make  generic  drugs  at  pennies  on  the  dollar.  Will  big  pharmaceutical 
companies  still  want  to  develop  these  drugs  if  they  can  be  knocked  off  in  emerging  markets? 
Maybe  pharmaceuticals  will  still  want  to  do  some  good  and  be  pragmatic,  realizing  that  they 
may not be  able  to prevent others  from  copying  them. You  can  think of  the global health arena 
as  a  complex  stage  with  many  actors,  including  funders  like  the  Bill  &  Melinda  Gates 
Foundation,  regulators  like  the  Ministry  of  Health  or  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA), 
companies, NGOs and so forth. 

90% of medical technology in the developing world is hand-me-down, and 80% of it fails within 6 
months.  The  failure  is  generally  from  simple  issues,  such  as  the  donating  organization  not 
realizing  the  roof  in Honduras  could  leak  and  short  out  the  equipment.  Siemens Corporation  in 
Germany donated an expensive color ultrasound machine to Nicaragua. A technician decided to 
try to hook up the screen to an antenna to watch the World Cup  in color. Now there  is a hunk of 
German technology just sitting there. How could the engineers in Siemens even plan for that?

One  example  of  an  innovative  technology  is  the  jet  injector, 
which  has  been  available  since  1947.  The  jet  injector 
delivers  a  dose  of  vaccine  through  the  skin  by  pushing  air 
with  enough  force  over  a  small  are,  similar  in  principle  to  a 
water  jet. Prefilled automatically,  this  innovation allows more 
patients  to  be  reached  and  have  access  to  the  vaccination 
compared  to  the  traditional  method,  where  healthcare 
workers  need  to  be  trained  to  clean  needles  and  administer 
shots.  Also  called  a  “peace  gun,”  the  jet  injector  was  a 
favorite  tool of vaccinators until  it was discovered  that  it had 
spread  hepatitis  in California. When  the  air  stops,  it  actually  © PATH.  All rights reserved. This content is

infect  the  next  patient.  The  device  was  pulled  and  health 
workers went  back  to  syringes  and  needles. This  is a  classic  example  of  the  backlash  that  can 
happen  when  something  goes  wrong,  even  if  the  device  has  the  potential  to  be  a  good 
technology.  Engineers  have  now  perfected  the  device  so  that  there  is  a  disposable  spacer 
between the gun and the skin that is changed between patients. 

José has also helped develop a device to deliver vaccines without 
a  needle  called  Aerovax,  which  allows  patients  to  inhale  the 
medicine  instead  of  receiving  it  by  injection.  Like  with  the  jet 
injector, vaccinators do not need specialized training to administer 
the  drugs  with  Aerovax.  Aerovax  has  an  added  advantage  in  that 
vaccines  in  this  form  can  be  kept  for  longer  (~7  days  in  the  field 
without refrigeration).

To  successfully  design  devices  for  global  health,  the  D-Lab  Health  program  goes  through  a 
design  cycle  that  involves  selecting  appropriate  design  attributes  and  utilizing  design  toolkit 
strategies  to  innovate. One  tool  for  this  process  is  the  global  health  innovation  compass, which 
measures how  long and how many resources  it  takes  to develop something against  its potential 
impact.  For  example,  developing  an  AIDS  vaccine  has  the  potential  to  be  very  high  impact  – 
there was a time when people almost gave up on curing polio and were trying to miniaturize iron 
lungs  to  allow  people  to  live  with  the  disease,  until  the  vaccine  came  out  and  changed  the 
nature of the game – however, vaccines can take a lot of money and time to develop. What else 
can we do in the meantime to have an impact?

One  area  of  opportunity  is  to  build  off  of  existing  technology  platforms,  like  the  mobile  phone. 
For example,  the  iPhone  is a powerful  technology  that  is capable of a wide  range of uses,  from 
storing medical texts like the entire content of Gray’s Anatomy to looking at magnetic resonance 
imaging  (MRI) scans and x-rays, but  it  is very costly. How can you work with what you have?  Is 
it  possible  to  transfer  some  capabilities  of  iPhone  to  the  more  affordable  and  ubiquitous  $25 
Nokia  phone?  For  example,  you may  not  need  all  the  information  at  once  –  can  you  take  it  off 
the phone and put  it on a server,  to be  transferred via SMS? What  features of  the Nokia phone 
can  you  use?  If  the  phone  has  a  built-in  camera,  maybe  you  can  do  colormetric  analysis  and 
send  photos  for  diagnosis  to  see  if  someone  has  sepsis,  so  people  don't  have  to  travel  long 
distances to the hospital in town. 

An  example  of  an  IIH  innovation  using  mobile  technology  is  XoutTB.  Tuberculosis  (TB)  is  an 
infectious  disease  that  attacks  the  lungs.  There  is  a  cure,  but  the  patient  needs  to  take 
antibiotics  every  day  for  about  six  months.  People  tend  to  take  the  drugs  for  only  1-2  months 
until they feel better from the disease but start to feel the vicious side effects of the drug, so they 
often  stop  while  the  disease  is  still  in  the  lungs  and  become  drug  resistant.  In  these  cases  of 
drug  resistant  TB,  treatment  costs  would  go  up  substantially  and  the  prohibitive  cost  could 
effectively  spell  out  a  death  sentence  for  some  patients.  The  current  method  of  ensuring 

Page 4 of 7 

patients stay on  their antibiotics  is  to send healthcare workers  to directly observe  them, but  this 
can be very  resource-intensive. A challenge was  issued  for people  to design  innovative ways  to 
ensure patients continue their treatment until completion. José initially thought people would use 
calendars,  bracelets,  and  songs  to  remind  patients  to  take  their  drugs.  He  worked  with 
economists  to  think of  incentives  to encourage patients  to  stay on  their  treatment. Even  though 
patients  receive  a  very  big  reward  after  following  the  treatment  course  for  6  months  (they 
survive), half a  year  is a  long  time,  so  there  is a need  for  short-term prizes as well. To address 
this,  José’s  team  came  up  with  XoutTB,  which  offers  cell  phone  minutes  to  patients  for  taking 
their antibiotics each day. 

Another  challenge  is  being  able  to  tell  whether  people  are  taking  their  drugs  without  observing 
them,  so  the  XoutTB  team  developed  a  device  that measures  the metabolyte  in  the  body  after 
taking the antibiotics. If the device senses that a patient has been taking his or her medication, it 
generates a random code that he or she has to enter in order to redeem the cell phone minutes. 
The  system  is  currently  undergoing  clinical  trials  in  Pakistan  with  1600  patients,  and  initial 
results  from  Nicaragua  show  that  people  like  it.  The  cost  of  the  XoutTB  system,  including  cell 
phone  minutes,  is  about  $7  per  patient,  which  is  cheaper  than  paying  for  health  workers  to 
physically  go  and  make  sure  that  people  are  taking  the  medication  (~$120  per  patient).  Not 
everyone  has  a  cell  phone  yet,  however,  and  there  are  concerns  about  whether  this  type  of 
incentive system will encourage people  to value  their health  less. More education may help, but 
compliance  is  still  a  big  issue  -  the United  States  healthcare  system  loses  about  $300  billion  a 
year  due  to  noncompliance  with  treatment.  In  addition  to  education,  health  workers  now  use 
pillboxes and incentives like airline miles to try to keep patients healthy and alive.

A  similar  innovation  is  disease  surveillance  in  Pakistan,  which  gives  health  workers  an  idea  of 
where  to  go  by  enabling  them  to  track  which  TB  patients  took  their  medication  and  which 
patients  need  to  be  referred  to  a  different  hospital.  These  initiatives  are  happening  in  Pakistan 
through  a  chance  relationship,  but  don’t  underestimate  what  can  come  from  serendipitous 
connections – collaboration  is important and can be very powerful. The  local partner  in Pakistan 
has  the  ability  to  run  trials  with millions  of  patients,  while  José  can  contribute  expertise  in  new 
technologies  such as microfluidic  chips. One way  to  think of a microfluidic  chip  is  to  compare  it 
to an  integrated  chip  in electronics, which holds an electric  circuit with different  components.  In 
this analogy, the microfluidic chip has  liquid running through  instead of electric current. This can 
get  advanced,  but  at  the  end  of  the  day, microfluidic  chips  basically  run  a  tiny  amount  of  liquid 
through  a  tiny  channel.  SNAP  (simple  nucleic  acid  processing)  is  a  device  José  helped  to 
develop  that  purifies  deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA)  in  the  field  for  diagnostic  tests  with 
microfluidic chips. SNAP basically  isolates  this  function by  running blood  through a  tiny channel 
to extract and purify the DNA. 

When designing appropriate medical devices, there some essential attributes to consider. Of the 
utmost  importance  is  safety  –  we  need  to  learn  from  mistakes  like  with  the  first  generation  jet 
injector.  Devices  in  these  settings  also  need  to  be  robust.  For  example,  vaccine  vials  may  be 
dropped  frequently  in  these environments and  should not break. Affordability  is  critical, but  so 
is  longevity  –  in  times  of  financial  hardship,  people  tend  to  continue  buying  consumables  like 
medicine  but  stop  buying  devices.  José  has  found  clinics  that  have  vaccines  but  no  syringes, 
which  are  categorized  as  medical  equipment.  We  also  need  to  design  for  reliability,  wear  and 
tear does not affect performance, or  if  it does, we know how performance  is affected. There  is a 
big  debate  about  reusability  vs.  disposability.    People  throw  away  nebulizers  in  Boston  but 

Page 6 of 7 

clean  them  in  Nicaragua  –  if  you  cannot  convince  people  to  throw  them  away,  you  have  to 
address  how  to  clean  them.  There  are  also  devices  that  you  would  not  want  people  to  reuse, 
like  syringes.  We  can  make  auto-disable  syringes  so  that  once  they  are  used,  they  lock  and 
people  cannot  pull  them  back  up  to  use  again.  Mom  and  Pop  clinics  and  shops  in  other 
countries  often  do  not  have  money  to  get  new  syringes  for  each  use,  but  they  may  buy  a 
repackaging machine to make things look new. 

Beyond  the  essential  attributes,  we  can  also  consider  enhancing  attributes,  such  as  mobile 
devices that can connect and interact with other devices. Redundancy is also nice to have, so 
we can replace things cheaply in case someone screws up one part of the device. For example, 
in  Aerovax,  there  is  a  piece  that  is  the most  delicate  and  also  the most  used  part.  If  that  piece 
breaks,  people  will  not  be  able  to  use  the  device  anymore,  so  the  team  looked  at  how  to 
improve the design to address it. 

The  good  news  is  that  there  are  a  lot  of  available  drugs  and  treatments  for  diseases.  The  bad 
news  is  that  it  may  be  difficult  to  deploy  these  solutions  (keep  them  refrigerated,  deliver  them, 
train people  to administer  them, etc.). This  is where we  can  focus on discovery and  innovation: 
inventing a better way to get these drugs and treatments to people who need them. 

So  how  do  we  get  there?  We  have  traditionally  employ  various  design  strategies,  such  as 
hybridization, or the mashing up of 2 technologies, such as the way the University of California 
at  Berkeley  adapted  a  cell  phone  into  a microscope  diagnostic  tool. We  can  combine  vintage 
and smart design,  like  the way a doctor  in Florida studied  toy Nerf guns and syringes  to make 
a dragon gun that shoots six injections in 1 minute for critical patients. Improvisation in design 
is  another  strategy  that  has  been  used  with  devices  such  as  inhalers.  Inhalers  require 
synchronized  breathing,  where  the  person  has  to  be  trained  to  breathe  in  at  the  same  time  as 
when  the  medicine  is  dispensed.  Young  children  who  may  be  scared  or  upset,  however,  may 
have  difficulties  using  the  inhalers.  In  response,  people  have  made  a  chamber  into  which  the 
medicine  can  be  dispensed,  so  kids  can  breathe  at  a  more  leisurely  pace.  The  device  is  $65, 
which many patients  in  the developing world cannot afford even  though  it  is sold  there. Doctors 
have started to use coke bottles to make a chamber for the inhaler and studies have shown that 
this works. Some  engineers  at Stanford University wanted  to  do  one  better,  so  they  now make 
origami  paper  inhalers  for  less  than  a  dollar.  We  can  also  shift  the  context,  like  the  way 
PlayPumps  use  merry-go-rounds  to  pump  water.  Aerovax  was  actually  invented  when  the 
designers were  inspired by how crops are sprayed  to eliminate  the  labor  involved  in dispensing 
chemicals. Crowdsourcing is becoming an increasingly popular design strategy. An example of 
this is enabling people to use connectors to design prosthetics. 

Let's  end  with  the  example  of  Medik  kits.  D-Lab  and  IIH  received 
support  from  the  Inter-American  Development  Bank  (IADB)  to 
encourage  more  people  to  do  innovative  design  work  for  global 
health.  The  goal  is  to  have  7  types  of  kits  that  are  the  health 
workers’  equivalent  of  erector  sets,  which  kids  use  to  build  their 
own  cars  and  toys,  so  doctors  and  nurses  can  have  the  tools  they 
need  to  make  quick  prototypes  of  medical  devices.  IIH  has  also 
started  a  class  in  Nicaragua  that  trains  and  encourages  health 
workers  to  design  medical  devices,  including  auto-disable  syringes  and  nebulizers,  using 
different  mechanisms.  This  type  of  design  work  can  be  done  and  should  be  done  more  in  the 
US, but  it  is  important  to  realize  that  this  innovative work can also be done and should be done 
abroad, closer to where the problems and end-users are located.
