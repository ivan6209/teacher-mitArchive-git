Kamilla  Gumede  is  a  research  fellow  at  the  Abdul  Latif  Jameel  Poverty  Action  Lab  (JPAL), 
heading  their  policy  outreach  work  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa.  She  works  with  governments  and 
NGOs in Africa to decipher policy lessons about what works, help make policies more evidence-
based  and  more  effective,  and  collaborate  with  researchers  and  policy  makers  to  identify  and 
run  randomized  evaluations  that  answer  pertinent  policy  questions  facing  African  decision-
makers. She has worked for the South African National Treasury to promote policy and capacity 
building.  She  has  also  worked  for  a  number  of  international  aid  agencies  in  Europe  and  Africa 
and brings to J-PAL a solid understanding of the policy environment in Africa and a rich network 
to African policymakers and researchers. 

The take home messages for today are: 
•	 Big development problems do not necessarily need big solutions 
•	 Conventional wisdom about development sometimes needs to be questioned 
•	 Do not always believe what  is written  in  the books because we have very  little evidence 
about what really works 

There is surprisingly little hard evidence and little change after 50 years of global aid. $65 billion 
a  year  have  been  spent  without  achieving  intended  results.  JPAL  is  a  network  of  39  economic 
professors around  the world  trying  to  figure out what works. They work across a wide spectrum 
of  sectors,  including  agriculture,  education,  health,  corruption/governance,  microfinance  and 
gender  issues. JPAL researchers have run over 200 experiments  in 30 countries to get rigorous 
evidence to assist policymakers in decision-making, such as trials where some groups receive a 
particular  intervention  while  some  groups  do  not,  enabling  them  to  compare  the  results.  They 
also  run  seminars  to  train policymakers  to  run experiments. A big part of what  JPAL  tries  to do 
is  to  compare  cost  effectiveness  and  see  what  policies  should  be  implemented  on  a  limited 
budget. They are interested in what interventions would provide the most bang for our buck. 

Kamilla asks the class to guess how best to get kids to go to school. The options are: 
8.  Deworm 
1.  School buildings  	
9.  Community oversight 
2.  Free textbooks  	
10. Cash for participation 
3.  Free uniforms  	
4.  Iron tablets 
5.  Extra teacher 

6.  Free school meals 
7.  Information  	
about  

returns to education

The  top  guesses  are  deworming,  free  school  meals,  free  textbooks,  free  uniforms  and 
community  oversight. Other  guesses  include  cash  for  participation  and  hiring  an  extra  teacher. 
Contrary  to what most people usually guess,  the class guessed deworming, which  is one of  the 
cheapest  interventions  to  increase  school  attendance.  Most  people  are  surprised  when  they 
hear  this,  but  deworming  has  a  direct  effect  on a  child’s  health, which  impacts  his or  her  ability 
to  attend.  Deworming  costs  only  $3.50  per  student  per  year  and  decreases  absenteeism  by 
30%. Another method  that works well  is  informing  parents  about  the  returns  to  schooling,  such 
as how much additional cash the child would earn after schooling.

It  is  important  to  remember  that  correlation  is  not  causation,  so  it  can  be  difficult  to  figure  out 
what  impacts are caused by  the  intervention and what  impacts are  influenced by other sources. 
For example, there has not been a rigorous, randomized trial on microfinance until recently. The 
people  who  go  to  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  to  apply  for  a  loan  are  different  from  people 
who would not do  so, and  it  is possible  that  the people with  the  initiative  to go  to an MFI would 
have  found  a  way  to make  it  somehow  even  without microfinance.  So  far,  studies  have  shown 
that  microfinance  is  not  a  silver  bullet  and  the  impacts  are  only  marginal,  but  then  again  MFIs 
have only really been followed for a year and a half. 

It  can  also  be  hard  to  measure  outcomes,  especially  when  relying  on  self-reported  data.  How 
accurate  would  a  survey  be  that  asks  about  engaging  in  risky  sex?  Corruption  is  particularly 
hard to measure. JPAL did a study where they conducted randomized audits of governments by 
digging holes in the roads to see what material was used and then comparing it to what material 

Development through Dialogue, Design & Dissemination 

was  supposed  to  be  used.  They  were  trying  to  see  which  oversight  methods  were  most 
effective, and it turns out that the threat of such an audit decreased corruption by 8%. 

Randomizations  are  sometimes  hard  to  do  politically,  because  people  prefer  everyone  to 
receive  something  rather  than  distributing  something  by  lottery. One  strategy  is  to  do  a  phase-
in, where some people receive something in year 1 and others receive something in year 2 or 3. 
Some  items,  like  textbooks,  cannot  be  randomized  by  individuals  because  people  share  them, 
so  you  would  have  to  randomize  distribution  by  communities.  Even  deworming  programs 
randomized  by  individuals  do  not  work,  because  it  is  an  infective  parasite  that  can  be  passed 
from student to student. It is only effective when the whole school is treated. 

Smart  incentives  are  an  interesting  topic  that  JPAL  studies. Vaccines  are  often  given  for  free, 
and  yet  there  is  low  coverage  in  many  places.  JPAL  attributes  this  effect  mainly  to 
procrastination.  The  mothers  understand  that  immunization  is  important  for  the  health  of  their 
children  and  has  positive  long-term  impacts,  but  something  day  to  day  always  comes  up  and 
seems  more  important.  For  example,  Kamilla  usually  ends  up  eating  her  chocolate  today  and 
saying  she  will  run  tomorrow,  like  many  other  people.  Procrastination  tends  to  happen 
especially with  preventative  health  care.  An  effective  intervention  turned  out  to  be making  sure 
that  nurses  were  present  during  vaccination  time  and  offering  mothers  a  bag  of  lentils  for 
immunizing  their  children.  In  some  trials,  the  immunization  rate  shot  up  more  than  30%.  This 
shows  the  power  of  small  interventions.  By  encouraging  more  families  to  go  to  immunization 
centers,  you  can  also  reduce  the  cost  per  immunization.  The  use  of  incentives  can  be  an 
important  policy  tool.  For  example,  you  can  get 
farmers to buy fertilizer when they still have money. 
The  trick  is  to  approach  them  right  after  a  harvest 
and  give  them  a  time-sensitive  voucher  that  allows 
them  to  buy  fertilizer  at  a  very  small  subsidy,  but 
only  if  they purchase  it within a week. This program 
was actually  far more effective  than a 50%  subsidy 
during  planting  season, when  farmers  did  not  have 
money  on  hand  to  invest  in  fertilizer.  In  another 
study,  school  attendance  was  doubled  by  offering 
small  bags  of  food  as  incentives  for  students  to 
bring home to their families.

Another  incentive,  scholarships,  can  really  vary  in  effectiveness,  depending  on  the  program. 
JPAL  did  a  study  with  young  adults  in  rural  Ghana  who  could  not  afford  secondary  school. 
These  students did well on qualifying exams, but did not attend  the  school  they were placed at 
because  they  could  not  afford  it.  Scholarships  were  given  out  randomly  to  600  out  of  2000 
students,  and  the  remaining  students  received  a  cell  phone.  JPAL  is  now  following  these 
students  for  10  years  to  see  if  they  are  attending  school  and  if  they  complete  school  within  3 
years.  It  turns  out  that  the  students  who  received  scholarships  and  the  students  who  received 
only  cell  phones  have  had  similar  results  so  far.  It may  take  some  students  who  received  only 
phones an extra year or  two to finish school, but some students who received scholarships may 
not end up finishing school at all. The incentives in this case did not quite function as hoped. 

JPAL  has  also  found  that  there  is  something  special  about  zero.  Many  people  say  that  it  is 
better  to sell something at cost  than  to give  it away  for  free so  that people will value  it. Bednets 
are  an  interesting  case  because  they  have  a  big  positive  impact  for  people  that  use  them,  but 
the  purchase  rate  may  not  be  that  high,  even  when  they  are  sold  at  a  very  minimal,  highly-

Development through Dialogue, Design & Dissemination 

subsidized  cost  at  clinics.  It  has  something  to  do  with  it 
being difficult  to  take out money  to buy  the bednet, even  if  it 
is affordable. JPAL did a study where  they compared clinics 
that  gave  out  bednets  for  free  with  clinics  that  charged  a 
small  fee  for  them.  It  was  found  that  many  more  bednets 
were  utilized  when  given  out  for  free,  and  it  is  cheaper  to 
give  out  the  bednets  at  once  at  a  clinic.  Charging  for 
bednets actually led to coverage dropping by 75%. JPAL still 
is  not  sure  whether  charging  people  for  bednets  increases 
the chance that people will use them correctly, but they have 
found  that  charging  for  bednets  often  ends  up  with  the 
bednet  being  used  by  the  breadwinner,  such  as  the  father.

When  given  out  for  free,  bednets  often  end  up  being  used 
by  the women and children. Another concern with giving  things away  is  that  it might destroy  the 
market, but when  researchers  returned after 2  years,  it  turns out  that people who  received  free 
bednets  were  actually  more  likely  to  buy  additional  ones.  JPAL  believes  that  once  people  see 
the benefit,  they and  their neighbors may become more willing  to pay  for bednets. This  is not  to 
say  that  everything  should  be  given  away  for  free,  especially  not  cars,  houses  and  televisions, 
but  people  are  notoriously  bad  at  spending  for  preventive  healthcare  so  charging  even  a  small 
fee  is a deterrent. JPAL also did a similar study on chlorinators, soap and school uniforms. This 
time they found that people were willing to pay for school uniforms in Kenya, where education is 
subsidized. 

Q: When advising donors, how do you extrapolate data to make recommendations? 
A:  JPAL  does  not  necessarily  believe  that  something  tested  in  one  area  of  Kenya  means  that 
the  impact  will  be  the  same  around  the  world,  so  they  will  do  other  studies  in  other  countries. 
Similarly,  just because a  trial was  region-specific does not necessarily mean  that  it cannot have 
any  relevance  for  the  rest  of  the  world.  For  example,  one  trial  investigated  if  having  a  female 
teacher would  increase  the attendance of  female  students, and ended up  retesting  this  in other 
places.  What  often  happens  is  JPAL  will  test  something  to  see  if  it  works,  and  then  roll  it  out 
across a country or retest it in other countries to see if impact is replicable. 

Q: How are you funded? 
A: JPAL  is a network of  researchers, and  the  researchers often  find  their own  funding. There  is 
some seed funding from a Middle East donor, but that goes to fund more policy work. 

Q: What's the sustainability of incentives? 
A:  We  certainly  think  a  lot  about  sustainability  and  this  was  one  of  the  first  criticisms  of  the 
bednet  study,  which  is  why  the  researcher  went  back  to  do  a  follow-up  study.  We  worry  a  lot 
about  sustainability  for  large  interventions  in  particular.  There  was  one  experiment  that  offered 
large  amounts  of  money  to  people  to  stay  HIV  negative,  but  it  ended  up  having  little  impact. 
While  the  women  tended  to  engage  less  in  risky  behavior,  the  men  spent  the  money  and  still 
had risky sex. Sometimes the incentive is so small that JPAL will recommend it even if the long-
term  implications are unsure. With vaccines, a bag of  lentils cost so  little  that  it  is worth offering 
it to keep children healthy. 

In conclusion, it is important to think about behavioral responses: 
•	  Remember  that  people  procrastinate.  Will  this  be  a  constraint  for  people  to  use  your 
technology? 

Development through Dialogue, Design & Dissemination 

o	 Think  about  encouraging  people  with  small  incentives  to  get  vaccinated  and  take 
medication. 
o	 You  can  trick  people  into  buying  fertilizers  and  saving  up  for  their  pension,  which 
have long-term benefits. 
•	 Don’t  forget  to  consider  the  channel  factors.  When  it  comes  to  interventions,  delivery 
matters and you need to facilitate how the intervention is delivered to maximize impact. 
o	 400  million  children  are  chronically  infected  with  worms  and  they  can  get  about  30 
days more school through deworming, but the low-cost intervention is only effective if 
most students in a school are dewormed to prevent cross-infection. 
o	 For a vaccination session, giving people a map with the time and date of the session 
can encourage more people to come and get vaccinated. 
•	 Effective  information  campaigns  can  be  very  powerful.  It  is  important  to  provide  people 
with  information  that says why an  intervention matters. Culture matters, and some pieces of 
information are more useful than others. 
o	
In  some  places,  soap  is  seen  more  as  a  cosmetic  rather  than  something  that  kills 
germs. 
o	 With  the case of arsenic contamination  in wells, people responded better  to a simple 
contaminated/clean rating or water over a progressive scale of contamination level. 
o	 People are much more likely to do something, like getting a bank account, when they 
are afraid of missing out rather than trying to gain something. 
o	 Small group discussions tend to have more impact than big lectures. 
•	  There  is  something  special  about  zero.  Charging  even  a  marginal  amount  to  cover  the 
cost of something can really discourage people from buying it. 
o	
JPAL  found  that  charging  even  a  small  amount  for  bednets  dramatically  decreased 
the adoption rate. 

JPAL encourages everyone to question conventional wisdom and test things out to find out what 
really has the greatest impact. A lot can be learned from small contexts and not all big problems 
necessarily  need  a  big  solution.  Finally,  JPAL  hopes  that  its  research  shows  that  cheap, 
practical solutions do exist and that behavioral responses matter. 

Kamilla will  send  the  titles  of  a  few  books  to  Amy  that may  interest  the  class.  There  are  also  a 
variety  of  mechanisms  to  get  involved  in  this  work,  such  as  through  the  Public  Service  Center 
grants/fellowships,  JPAL  internship  opportunities,  the  IDEAS  competition  and  the  Yunus 
Challenge. Each year,  the Yunus Challenge highlights a pressing and often overlooked need of 
the world’s poor. Winning teams receive funding to continue their work. 

The first Yunus Challenge was on tuberculosis (TB) drug adherence. There is a cure for TB, but 
it  requires  6-9 months  of  continuous  treatment  and  there  is  a  problem with  people  not  finishing 
their medication, which can  lead to drug resistance. As people take the medication and begin to 
feel  better,  the  side  effects  of  the  drug  become  more  noticeable  and  may  discourage  patients 
from  taking  it  or  health  workers  may  stop  showing  up  to  make  sure  patients  are  continuing 
treatment.  Directly  Observed  Treatment  Short  course  (DOTS)  is  a  response  method  to  TB 
which  includes observing and supporting patients  to make sure  they are  taking  their medication 
regularly.  DOTS  has  been  recommended  widely,  but  has  been  hard  to  implement  in  many 
places because it is costly to send people to rural areas to monitor patients. 

One Yunus Challenge  team, XoutTB, basically  tried  to adapt  the DOTS system  to make  it more 
robust and affordable. With the XoutTB procedure, the user urinates on a strip which will react if 
they  have  taken  the  drug  and  allow  the  patient  to  get  a  code  for  free  cell  phone  minutes  as  a 

Development through Dialogue, Design & Dissemination 

form of  instant gratification. There  is a daily deadline so people have to submit their results by a 
certain time, and health care centers can call patients to remind them. This system will not work 
for  everyone,  but  it  may  work  for  a  lot  of  people.  XoutTB  is  also  far  cheaper  than  DOTS.  The 
small  incentive ends up being a  lot cheaper  than other  interventions, such as sending someone 
in  person  to  monitor  patients  as  they  take  their  treatment.  The  team,  led  by  Jose  Gomez-
Marquez,  instructor  of  D-Lab:  Health  and  manager  of  the  International  Innovations  in  Health 
program,  is  now  doing  a  trial  in  Pakistan  in  collaboration  with  JPAL.  With  the  involvement  of 
researchers, there is a nice back and forth going on between development practice and theory. 

This  year's  Yunus  Challenge  is  about  hand  hygiene,  and  it  is  open  for  anyone  at  MIT  to  enter 
next  semester.  2  million  children  die  every  year  from  diarrhea,  but  this  can  be  prevented. 
Preventing fecal-oral transmission of disease through hand hygiene is said to be one of the best 
ways  of  preventing  diarrheal  diseases  and  acute  respiratory  infections.  There  was  a  study 
where  people  were  provided  with  free  soap  and  given  information  about  the  importance  of 
washing hands. This worked, but turned out to be expensive because the researchers may have 
overdone  the  program  a  bit  by  giving  out  3  blocks  of  soap  a  day  and  visiting  the  households 
daily  to  remind  them  to wash  their hands. Unfortunately,  there  is no  information on whether  this 
intervention would work  if people were only given one block of soap and reminded occasionally. 
JPAL  has  not  really  done  a  study  on  clean  hands  yet  and  hopes  the  students  will  have  some 
interesting ideas and findings. 

In  addition  to  encouraging  good  hand  hygiene  to  prevent  oral-fecal  transmission  of  diseases, 
another  method  that  is  widely  recommended  to  prevent  diarrhea  is  to  provide  safe  drinking 
water.  People  have  tried  a  wide  range  of  interventions,  including  expensive  options  like 
providing piped water. There was a study done on clean water  in Kenya, but  the  issue was  that 
the  system  did  not  prevent  against  recontamination.  Another  system  involves  putting  the  clean 
water  in  containers  with  a  small  bottleneck,  so  people  cannot  dip  contaminated  containers  into 
the  storage  container.  People  preferred  their  original  ceramic  containers  to  these  new  plastic 
containers,  however,  because  the  water  was  warm  during  the  summer.  Some  people  even 
bought ice to put into their water to cool it down, and the ice could be contaminated. 

Development through Dialogue, Design & Dissemination 

A  recent  finding  in  Kenya  and  Pakistan  is  that  providing  chlorinators  can  be  quite  effective,  as 
they protect against recontamination, but  it can cost a  lot of money  to get  the solution out  there, 
at  about  $21  for  every  case  of  diarrhea  prevented.  Bottles  tend  to  cost  more  than  the  actual 
chlorine solution, so transportation expenses can be high to deliver bottles of chlorine solution to 
households. An alternative chlorination option  is  to put a  large dispenser next  to  the community 
water source. This is can be more affordable, at about $1 per every case of diarrhea prevented.

We  encourage  anyone  who  is  interested  to  form  a  team  and  work  on  an  idea  to  reduce 
incidences  of  water-borne  disease  through  promoting  good  hand  hygiene.  Teams  enter  the 
Yunus  Challenge  by  going  through  the  IDEAS  Competition. Winners  will  be  announced  in  late 
spring of 2010.
