Hands-On Human Power 
Class Outline for October 9, 2009: 
•  Treadle Pump (Leg Power) Exercise 
•  Flashlight (Hand Power) Exercise 
•  Wheelchair (Arm Power) Exercise 
•  Bicimolino (Leg Power) Exercise 

The  following  four  activities  are  run  in  rotation  so  students  have  an  opportunity  to  see  how 
different parts of  their body –  the hand,  the arms and  the  legs – compare  in power output. Most 
students are surprised to see how much stronger their legs are than their arms. 

Treadle Pump Exercise: 
In  this  activity,  students  make  a  rough  estimate  of  the  power  they  use  to  pump  water  up  to  a 
certain height. To do this, they use p = ρ x g x h to find the pressure (where ρ is water density, g 
is  acceleration  due  to  gravity  and  h  is  the  height).  Then  the  students  estimate  the  power  by 
using  P  =  p  x  Q,  where  p  is  the  pressure  from  earlier  and  Q  is  the  volumetric  flow  rate  of  the 
water being pumped.

Flashlight Exercise: 
The  students  in  this module are given  two hand pumped LED  lights. Each  squeeze produces a 
certain  amount  of  energy  that  is  then  used  to  charge  the  light.  One  light  is  fully  assembled  for 
students  to  see  how  it  works.  The  other  light  has  the  LEDs  removed,  and  bare  wires  in  their 
place.  With  some  alligator  clips  and  a  multi-meter,  students  are  asked  to  measure  how  much 
energy a person could produce from the  light pump. The students estimate the power using P = 
V²  /  R.  The  value  of  R,  the  resistance,  is  known  because  the  students  use  a  set  resistor. 
Students  then measure  their  voltage  output,  or V,  using  the multi-meter. Since  people  tire  over 
time, students are asked to average V over one minute to get a more consistent period of power 
production.

Wheelchair Exercise: 
This  activity  has  been  designed  by  Amos Winters,  Instructor  of  the  D-Lab: Wheelchairs  for  the 
Developing  World  class.  Students  estimate  the  output  of  human  power  while  using  a 
wheelchair. The  students  break  into  small  groups  and  start by  using  a  spring  scale  to measure 
the  force  needed  to  overcome  the  rolling  resistance,  Fpull.  To  do  this,  one  person  sits  on  the 
wheelchair and holds the end of the scale while someone else pulls them at a constant velocity. 
The  students  then  estimate  their  average  velocity  when  rolling  a  wheelchair,  V,  by  using  a 
measuring  tape  and  stopwatch  to  figure  out  how  long  it  takes  them  to  traverse  a  certain 
distance. Students  then calculate  the power using P = Fpull  x V  (neglecting air  resistance). Each 
group uses a different  type of wheelchair –  regular or  lever – so  the students can compare  their 
outputs.  If  time allows,  students  can also measure  their power output  on a hill using P =  [Fpull + 
mgsinθ]  x  V  or  P  =  mg  x  Vvertical  (where  m  is  the  total  mass  of  the  chair  and  the  person,  g  is 
acceleration  due  to  gravity,  θ  is  the  angle  of  the  slope,  and  Vvertical   is  the  vertical  velocity). 
Students  are  able  to  experience  how  one  can  get  more  power  on  a  lever  chair  with  a  steeper 
slope,  especially  when  they  push  the  levers  further  from  the  wheels  to  get  more  torque. 
Measuring  the  efficiency  of  the  wheelchair  is  a  little  more  challenging  and  is  not  done  in  this 
activity. The process usually  involves measuring  the user’s heart  rate  to  see how hard  they are 
working and comparing to their resting heart rate.

Bicimolino Exercise: 
This activity involves measuring the power used to grind corn in a pedal powered grain mill. The 
bicimolino  drives  an  inexpensive  hand-crank  grain  mill  with  a  sprocket  taking  power  from  a 
bicycle drive  train.   For power measurement,  the hand-crank grain mill  is mounted on a bearing 
concentric with  the drive sprocket.   Rotation of  the whole mill  is prevented by an arm connected 
to a  force sensor. The  length of  the arm  times  the  force at  the end provides a  torque  reading, τ. 
Counting of pedal strokes gives the speed at the pedals, and multiplying this by the ratios of the 
sprockets  in  the  drive  train  gives  revolutions  per  minute,  or  rpm,  of  the  mill.  Students  then 
estimate  power  by  using P  = F  x V  (where F  is  force  and V  is  velocity)  =  τ  x  ω  (where  ω  is  the 
angular velocity).
