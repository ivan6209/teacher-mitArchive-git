Class Outline for October 2, 2009: 
•  Agriculture Focus Groups 

The  annual  International Development Fair  at MIT  took  place  from  1-3pm  this  afternoon, which 
provides  incoming  and  continuing  MIT  students,  recent  graduates  and  members  of  the  MIT 
community  an  opportunity  to  learn  about  ways  that  they  can  become  engaged  in  international 
development  through  student  groups,  non-profit  organizations,  academic  course  offerings  and 
other  activities  on  and  around  MIT's  campus.  Groups  and  organizations  of  all  types  set  up 
booths  to  display  their  development  projects  and  enlist  the  interested  individuals  who  pass 
through  the  fair  grounds.  The  annual  Fair  is  organized  by  the  MIT  International  Development 
Network  (IDN),  a  community  network  developed  to  promote  and  share  information  about  
activities, programs, events, and formal academic offerings related to international development. 

Agriculture Focus Groups: 
In  preparation  for  today’s  class,  students  read  articles  and  thought  pieces  on  different  topics  in 
agriculture. During class, the students split up into focus groups to discuss the following: 
•  Agriculture and Human Rights 
•  Agriculture and Structural Readjustment 
•  The Green Revolution 

Kofi Taha leads a group discussion on agriculture and human rights.

Discussion on Agriculture and Human Rights: 
This  session  began  with  students  identifying  some  basic  rights  in  life  that  they  wanted  to  see 
enforced by international law: 
•  Work 
•  Education 
•  Food 
•  Housing 

•  Safe Working Conditions 
•  Health 
•  Freedom 

Subsistence-level farmers who depend on their crop entirely for food and income generation are 
vulnerable not only to extreme weather such as floods and drought, but also to price fluctuations 
in  the  market.  Major  exports  from  developing  countries  include  coffee,  sugar,  and  cacao 
(chocolate).  With  these  commodities,  the  practice  of  “dumping”  surplus  production  into  the 
market can have very serious  impacts on  farmers producing at a small-scale on sub-acre plots. 
How would these farmers be affected if imports became cheaper? What if 10% of what is grown 
was exported? Even when  the market  is strong,  local  farmers often  receive  the smallest portion 
of  the profit, despite doing  the  lion’s share of  the work. You may pay $3.25  for a Frappuccino at 
Starbucks,  but  realize  that  only  $0.02  may  actually  reach  the  local  grower.  At  Target,  you  can 
buy  6  pairs  of  socks  for  $3.99.  Inputs  include  cotton,  manufacturing  labor  (most  likely  from  
China), and plastic packaging. Are we concerned about the cotton picker? The packer? 

What is the difference between “free” trade and “fair” trade? “Free” trade has been the approach 
of the World Trade Organization, which has been championing an open market with no tariffs or 
subsidies  since  1995.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  and  World  Bank  function  on  a  similar 
framework.  Products and prices are often driven by consumer demand. “Fair” trade, in contrast, 
sets  floors  or  guaranteed  prices  for  producers  and  is  more  of  a  social  investment.  Producers 
can make use of waivers or form cooperatives for better protection. 

Is  globalization  truly  better  for  everyone?  The  current  system  supports  maximizing  profits  first, 
which  can  produce  inhumane  conditions.  Can  there  be  agreements  between  “free”  trade  and 
“fair”  trade  where  profits  are  maximized,  but  not  purely  with  monetary  units?  Consumers  may  
decide  to  pay  a  premium  for  something  they  value  –  the  moral  premium  for  knowing  that  
something  is  fair of  “sweat-free.” People may even pay more  to  fund an  initiative, which  is what 
the Red Campaign and Ethos Water rely on. 

The  class engaged  in a discussion on  language  choice, since  they noticed  that debates on  this 
topic  sometimes  use  terminology  with  strong  connotations  such  as  “backward”  and  “modern 
economic activity.” Is the term “fair trade” becoming like the term “sustainability,” which is getting 
a  lot  of  use  but  does  not  always  have  much  meaning  anymore?  In  the  international  human 
rights paradigm, the weakest link has not been building awareness, but implementation. 

Some documentaries recommended by the group include “The Corporation,” “Price of Sugar” on 
sugarcane production in Haiti, and “Life and Debt,” which gives an introduction to “dumping” and 
how  local  industries are affected. Interested students may also wish  to check out  the Fair Trade 
Campaign advert by Oxfam or the Milton Friedman Institute, which is a think tank in Chicago.
