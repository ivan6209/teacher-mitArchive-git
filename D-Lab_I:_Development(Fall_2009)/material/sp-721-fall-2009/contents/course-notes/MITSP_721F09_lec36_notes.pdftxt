Ben  Linder went  to  graduate  school with Amy  at MIT 
and  both  are  avid  beekeepers.  Ben  is  now  a 
professor  at  Olin  College  of  Engineering  and  is  one 
of 
International 
the 
for 
lead  organizers 
the 
Development  Design  Summit  (IDDS).  Passionate 
about  the  practice  of  design  and  design  learning,  he 
is  especially  interested  in  socially  responsible  and 
sustainable  product  design.  His  design  work  also 
involves  the  adaptation  of  engineering  techniques  to 
the  arts.  He  is  actively  involved  in  entrepreneurship 
and  is  currently  studying  business  structures  for 
social  ventures.  Recently,  he  co-founded  a  software 
company  focused  on  delivering  product  development 
tools to large manufacturing firms. 

Ben starts off  the class by  taking a brief survey about Hopenhagen, a closely coordinated effort 
between the UN and various organizations to build up the media around the Copenhagen. They 
don’t  seem  to  be  doing  well,  because  this  campaign  has  been  going  since  the  middle  of  this 
year  and  only  7  people  in  the  class  have  heard  of  it. Only  9  people  in  this  class  have  heard  of 
350.org,  named  to  reflect  the  target  of  getting  back  down  to  350  ppm  of  carbon  in  the 
atmosphere,  so  this  campaign  could  also  be  doing  better.  Since  the  United  Nations  Climate 
Change Conference is happening in Copenhagen next week, we will talk about carbon today. 

In  the US, we  are  currently  emitting  about  20  kg  of  carbon  per  person  per  year.  In  the UK,  it  is 
about  12  kg  per  person  per  year.  Jim Hanson warns  that  if we  cross  400  ppm  of  carbon  in  the 
atmosphere, we  could be  looking at an  ice-free world. The  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) talks about future scenarios where the world may reach 450 ppm, 550 ppm, 650 
ppm  of  carbon  in  the  atmosphere.  They  may  have  lost  hope,  because  they  mostly  talk  about 
550 ppm as what they think is more probable. So far, almost all the IPCC projections have been 
too conservative, so that might make 550 ppm too conservative as well. We are currently at 385 
ppm  and  going  up  by  about  2  ppm  per  year,  so  you  can  see  that we may  not  have much  time 
left to sort out climate change – experts say that we have about 20 years. Is carbon a source or 
a  sink problem? The  class answers  that  carbon  is mostly a  sink problem. Fossil  fuels are more 
likely to cause a major climate change problem before the supply runs out.  

Carrying capacity  is a concept  that about half  the class says  they are  familiar with.  It  refers  to a 
point  at  which  a  resource  will  degrade  if  we  take  anymore  out  before  putting  anymore  in.  We 
Page 1 of 6 

should  take no more wood  from a  forest  than  the  rate at which  it would cause  the  forest  to  lose 
biomass,  degrading  the  forest.  If  you  never  exceed  this  carrying  capacity,  then  you  can  take 
wood out  forever.  If you exceed  it a  little, you need  to  take  less out or none out  for a while  to  let 
the  natural  system  recover.  Natural  systems  can  be  incredibly  resilient.  If  you  exceed  the 
carrying capacity by too much, however, the system can degrade. There can even be a positive 
feedback loop that causes a runaway system. 

If  we  had  a  better  sense  of  what  is  the  carrying  capacity  of  the  population  of  a  fish,  then  we 
could  try  to  avoid a population  collapse  like what happened with  the Atlantic Cod. What does  it 
mean  to  no  longer  have  the  Atlantic  Cod  in  the  world  anymore?  Experts  have  estimated  25% 
species extinction by 2050. 

There are 3 important rules to remember: 
1. 	 You have to measure carrying capacity. [Note: It can be really difficult to measure this 
in a dynamic system. People pursue entire careers around this.] 
2. 	 You have to stay under carrying capacity. 
3. 	 You have to be well-adapted. [Note: There  is a whole other career around how to build 
adapted systems.] 

We  can  also  talk  about  natural  capital.  What  kind  of  resources  and  natural  services  are  we 
getting  from  the  environment? What  is  their  value  to  us?  For  example,  fresh water would  have 
to  be  replaced  by  desalination  of  salty  water.  How  much  would  it  cost  to  build  a  desalination 
plant?  Around  the  world,  a  big  natural  resource  is  fuel,  in  various  forms  (biomass,  natural  gas, 
etc.).  The  estimated  value  of  natural  capital  has  been  $16-54  million  when  the  global  value  of 
the market was $30  trillion. As designers and engineers, do we actually  create wealth? We are 
good at  taking natural materials and  translating  them  into usable  form, but  the actual  root value 
usually comes from the materials, rather than from what we make. 

First  coined  by  John  Elkington,  the  Triple  Bottom  Line  of  economic,  social  and  environmental 
returns  (also  known  as  “People,  Planet,  Profit”)  is  often  depicted  as  a  venn  diagramm,  but  it  is 
more accurately represented as embedded circles so you can see the boundary conditions. You 
have  to pass  through society  to go  from monetary  sustainability  to environmental  sustainability. 
You  can  talk about designing closed  loop  systems, but  the  funny  thing about  the second  law of 
thermodynamics is that energy actually flows through systems.

Ben  shows  a  graph  of  normalized  Human  Development  Index  (HDI)  against  a  measure  of 
ecological  footprint  (E),  reproduced  on  the  next  page.  HDI  measures  basic  health  (including 
mortality  and  morbidity),  education  (including  literacy  and  rates  of  completion  for  primary  and 
secondary  school),  and  economics  (including  income  in  purchasing  power  parity).  E  includes 
things  like water,  land,  food, and greenhouse gas emissions. When we  talk about  the definition 
of sustainability, you almost invariably see definitions like the following: 

"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present 
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” 
~Brundtland Commission

You can think of sustainability as having two major components: human development and 
environmental. Our quality of life is inextricably linked to our environmental impact. If you look at 
water, sanitation, and other conditions that impact health, which is a part of quality of life, you 
can see that they all are linked to environmental resources.

This graph  is  important because  it  shows  that our quality of  life  that does not necessarily  come 
only  at  the  cost  of  greater  environmental  impact.  For  example,  Cuba  (in  the  upper  left-hand 
corner  of  the  yellow  quadrant)  has  relatively  high  health  care  and  education  quality,  but 
relatively  low environmental  impact compared  to many  industrialized nations. Development and 
sustainability are not linearly related. In fact, it is only with the most developed countries, like the 
US, where a relatively high quality of life is correlated with a very high environmental impact. 

How can we decouple development  from environmental  impact? We want  to be able  to address 
human  development  issues  such  as  health  and  education  while  not  incurring  a  lot  of  negative 
environmental  impact. There  are many  different  approaches. One  of  the  first  things we  have  to 
do  is define  the region/context we are  talking about so we can measure  the carrying capacity.  If 
we  look at ecological  footprint and available biocapacity by  region, we can see  that  the US and 
Western Europe have exceed where  they  should be, and places  like Asia and Africa are under 
where  they  could  be.    Places  like  London  need  way  more  land  than  they  actually  occupy  to 
produce enough resources  to sustain  them, so  they often extract  them  from elsewhere, such as 
developing countries. The fact that we trade allows us to maximize the population we can put on 
any  given  ecosystem.  If  there  is  a  limiting  resource, we  can  exchange  with  another  ecosystem 
to  satisfy  our  demand.  This  is  what  has  allowed  us  to  increase  our  population  substantially  in 
certain areas, over what may be sustainable.

We are  looking  to both minimize  the  resources we use as well as use better  resources such as 
renewable  energy.  Some  resources,  like  sand  and  salt  water,  may  be  abundant,  however,  we 
want  to  use  resources  that  are  not  only  abundant  and  renewable,  but  high  quality.  It  is  not 
enough  to  just have a more efficient stove  to  reduce  fuel consumption; you also need  to have a 
management  program  for  the  fuel  that  feeds  the  stove.  We  might  expect  that  in  general,  fuel 
consumption  would  decrease  as  income  increases,  since  people  tend  to  shift  toward  using 
resources  that  are  more  efficient  and  of  higher  quality.  This  is  not  always  the  case,  however, 
because it depends on what is available in the region we are talking about.

Ben shows a powerful picture where  the Dominican Republic  is covered  in  forest on one side of 
the island, and Haiti has very little forest on the other side of the island. A lot of this difference is 
due  to  policy. We  cannot  take  this  as  the  full  picture  of  what  is  happening,  but  the  collapse  of 
the  forest  in  Haiti  is  very  real,  not  to  mention  one  of  the  reasons  why  we  are  working  on 
agricultural waste  charcoal  as  an  alternative  fuel  source.  If  you  look  at  energy  consumption  by 
source  in  Haiti,  biomass  dominates  the  “other”  non-fossil-fuel-based  sources  outside  of 
hydroelectric  and  nuclear  power.  Haiti  has  even  turned  to  the  Dominican  Republic  to  source 
enough  wood  for  making  wood  charcoal,  which  70%  of  the  population  uses  to  cook.  In  Africa, 
about 80% of  the energy consumption among people  living  in poverty  is  from biomass, such as 
wood or dung. Around the world, about 60% of people living in poverty use biomass for fuel. 

SELCO  Co-Founder  Harish  Hande,  who  leads  a  solar  company  in  India,  is  famous  for  making 
the  argument  about  how  valuable  solar  power  can  be  in  the  development  context. Solar  power 
can make sense for people living in poor rural communities, even though it may not be as cheap 
as other energy sources. In the US, we tend to think about solar panels as something to protect 
the environment. Solar makes  less sense economically  in the US because with all the subsidies 
tied  to conventional electricity sources, we do not see  the real price of electricity. SELCO  thinks 
about solar in terms of its potential to impact development instead. SELCO would have to spend 
their  entire  budget  to  find  out what  their  environmental  impact  really  is  in  India  and  they  do  not 
want  to make  claims  they  cannot  support,  but  they  can measure  increased  productivity  of  their 
customers and that is something that really matters to them. 

Envirofit  is  another  interesting  company  that  works  on  motorbike  retrofits  in  South  East  Asia. 
The motorbikes commonly used  for  transport  in developing countries can each put out as much 
pollution  as  50  cars.  The  Envirofit  retrofit  system  reduces  environmental  impact  while  allowing 
taxi  drivers  to  earn  more  money  by  decreasing  the  amount  of  fuel  used.  Solutions  do  exist 
where you can increase the developmental impact while reducing environmental impact.

The  interesting  thing  is  if  you  ask  where  SELCO  and  Envirofit  are  going,  they  are  both  looking 
into  stoves.  That  target  corner  of  the  development-environmental  impact  space  has  major 
opportunities.

Fuel-Efficient Stove Estimation Exercise: 
The  students  are  split  into  groups  for  this  activity.  [Aside:  Ben  realized  that  many  people  are 
sitting  on  the  floor  because  we  have  switched  classrooms  today  for  group  exercises  and  there 
are not enough seats. Amy  jokes that this is  like the $2 day activity, except we’re practicing  lack 
of  furniture.  Ben  adds  that  we  shouldn’t  use  computers  or  pencils  for  this  activity  either.  Amy 
responds that we have abacuses for everyone.] 

Each  group  receives  two  documents.  One  document  gives  the  embodied  energy  &  carbon  for 
different  types of materials. Embodied energy  is how much  energy  it  takes  to make  something, 
such  as  a  kilogram  of  concrete  or  steel.  Embodied  carbon  is  how  much  carbon  is  emitted 
through  use  of  that  material.  The  other  document  is  a  cheat  sheet  from  ORNL  of  conversion 
factors  for  energy  in  biomass.  Remember  that  timber  is  distinct  from  fuel  wood,  which  refers 
more  to branches and dead  trees. Often  it becomes unsustainable when  you  start  cutting  trees 
for timber, which is what happens for the production of paper and furniture. 

The  scenario  is  that  we  could  build  a  metal  stove  or  build  a  more  efficient  metal  stove  with  a 
ceramic  liner. The  class  is asked  to  calculate how  long  (in days) we  could  run  the  stove before 
the ceramic liner is paid for. For a bonus question, how long before the metal is paid back? 

Hints: 
•	 Ceramic  liners  can  give  efficiency  improvements  of 
10%-40%. 
•	 The metal  stove  weighs  about  10-20  kg  (10  kg  is  22 
lbs).  A  sheet  metal  stove  would  weigh  substantially 
less. 
•	 The handouts tell you how much energy is in ceramic 
and  steel,  as well  as  how much  energy  is  in wood  or 
other things that we would burn. 
•  Ben has  information on different energy densities, as 
well as rates of fuel consumption. 

Given  that Ben would  never  just  give  people  the  answer,  a  curious  person  could  go  into D-Lab 
and  actually  weigh  the  different  stoves.  If  installing  a  ceramic  insulator  pays  for  itself  with  X 
days, why not install it? 

These  are  important  types  of  calculations  to  do  because  it  turns  out  that  with  a  carousel 
generator,  for  example,  you  cannot  ever  generate  enough  energy  to  recover  the  energy  that 
went into all that steel. You could add a generator to an existing carousel or use virgin aluminum 
instead,  but  it  would  not  make  sense  to  produce  a  new  carousel.  Embodied  energy  is  a  really 
fundamental concept to understand. 

While  Ben  is  not  going  to  just  provide  the  answer,  he  will  give  some  advice.  He  would  rather 
have students walk out of class without the answer but with the drive to figure it out on their own 
until they are confident in it, because that is what it takes to be able to take action.
