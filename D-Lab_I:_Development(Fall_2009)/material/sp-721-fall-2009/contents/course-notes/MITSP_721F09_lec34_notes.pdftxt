D-Lab: Development

Market Approaches to Development 
Class Outline for November 30, 2009: 
•  Water Roleplay 
•  Market Approaches to Development & Supply Chains 

The  class  started  with  a  roleplaying  activity  on  forming  a 
community  water  committee,  which  will  be  discussed  next 
time.  Amy  attempted  to  channel  Paul  Polak  for  today’s 
lecture,  who  is  one  of  D-Lab’s  longtime  friends  and 
business  gurus.  Paul  is  the  founder  of  International 
Development  Enterprises  (IDE),  arguably  one  of  the  more 
successful  organizations  at  disseminating  appropriate 
technologies.  IDE  has  established  distribution  networks 
with  thousands  of  people  selling  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Courtesy of Paul Polack. Used with permission. 
drip  irrigation  kits  and  millions  of  treadle  pumps  in  several  countries,  while  many  other 
development  organizations  would  be  excited  about  implementing  a  thousand  of  anything.  For 
comparison,  Amy  is  happy  to  have  61  charcoal  production  workshops  in  Haiti.  People  used  to 
be disturbed by the idea of charging money from the poor, but now it has been shown that IDE’s 
approach  of  charging  an  affordable  price  to  cover  the  costs  of  manufacturing,  distribution  and 
maintenance can be scalable and sustainable. The organization does still  receive  some grants, 
because they do not pass on the costs of the research and development and marketing costs to 
the  consumers,  but  Paul  insists  that  the  only  way  for  a  system  to  be  self-sustaining  is  if 
everyone  involved  the supply chain  is able  to gain some  value. Think about not only how  value 
is getting added along the chain, but how is it can be extracted. 

In Out of Poverty, Paul discusses  three great myths of poverty eradication. 
He  first challenges  the  idea  that we can donate people out of poverty, and 
asserts  that  easiest  way  to  end  poverty  is  to  provide  people  with  tools  to 
make  more  money.  Income  generation  has  actually  only  been  in  focus 
among  the  international  development  community  for  the  last  couple  of 
decades, so this idea is relatively recent. A second popular myth is that we 
can  end  poverty  through  national  economic  growth.  Paul  points  out  that 
the  trickle  down  effect  has  simply  not  happened  the  way  we  had  hoped, 
and  people  at  the  bottom  income  bracket  have  not  seen  the  benefits  from 
growth  that  they  should.  The  third  myth  is  that  multinationals  can  end 
poverty, but Paul maintains  that  this will not happen as  they are structured 
now. It is great that large companies like Coca Cola and Proctor & Gamble 
have  found  a  way  to  sell  to  the  base  of  the  pyramid,  but  there  is  still  a  gap  in  addressing  the 
needs  of  people  living  in  poverty.  At  the  rate  we  are  going  with  traditional  methods  of  poverty 
alleviation, Paul believes we will never reach the millennium development goals (MDGs).

The  class  went  over  the  example  of  the  treadle  pump,  which  is  one  of  IDE’s  most  famous 
products. When they first started making and selling these devices, they found that most people 
did  not  know  what  a  treadle  pump  was.  One  of  the  biggest  tasks  here  was  to  build  up 
awareness, which  is  something  that we may also have  to do  for our projects.  It  is  interesting  in 
how Paul approached this challenge with his psychiatry background, rather than as an engineer. 
Under  his  leadership,  IDE  tried  out  different  village  marketing  techniques,  from  singing 
troubadours  and  puppet  shows  to  treadle  pump  technology  demonstrations  in  the  community. 
They  even  produced  a  Bollywood-style  movie  using  the  leading  producers,  songwriters  and

actors  in Bangladesh. The  basic  story  in  the  film  is  that  a girl  and  boy  fall  in  love  but  the  father 
does  not  have  enough  money  to  pay  the  dowry.  The  treadle  pump  plays  a  key  role  here, 
because  the  father  finds  out  about  the  technology  from  a  neighbor  and  is  able  to  use  one  to 
earn  enough  money  for  the  marriage  and  everyone  lives  happily  ever  after.  There  were  some 
critics of  these social marketing  techniques at  first, but  IDE has been able  to have an  incredible 
impact on the market by understanding what the users want. Over 2 million treadle pumps have 
been  sold,  increasing  the  income  of  poor  families  by  $210  million  a  year.  In  addition,  treadle 
pumps  are  a  powerful  transitional  technology  so  what  tends  to  happen  is  that  people  earn 
enough  money  to  buy  a  diesel  pump,  which  enables  them  to  pump  more  water  than  they  can 
use  and  sell  the  surplus.  IDE  has  found  that  their  customers  tend  to  spend  their  additional 
income  on  food,  agricultural  production  and  education. Not  everyone who  uses  this  technology 
is  lifted  out of  poverty  for  the  rest  of  their  lives, as  there  are  always  risks with  crop  failures  and 
such,  but  a  large  majority  can  increase  their  income  sustainably  thereafter,  moving  away  from 
subsistence  farming  and  into  the  middle  class.  IDE  currently  prioritizes  technologies  that  can 
directly  contribute  to  income  generation,  such  as  treadle  pumps  and  low-cost  irrigation.  This  is 
not  to  say  that  IDE  do  not  think  other  interventions  are  also  important,  such  as  nutritional 
supplements  that  could  increase  productivity  and  impact  earnings  less  directly,  but  they 
recognize their own area of expertise and want to be focused.

IDE’s  innovative  approach  to  selling  technologies 
like  the  treadle  pump  has  not  only  been  on  the 
business  side.  They  also  invested  many  years  in 
research  and  development 
to  make 
the 
technology  as 
inexpensive  as  possible  and 
adaptable  to  he  local  area.  In  some  regions,  the 
treadle  pumps  are  sold  without  steps,  which 
people  can  make 
themselves  out  of 
local 
materials such as bamboo. Affordability is key and 
Paul  stresses  that  we  need  to  understand  how 
people  can  afford  to  spend  their  money.  For

example,  people  often  do  not  have  the  ability  to 
invest  in durable goods because  they do not have  the available capital, but  they may be able  to 
invest  in  cheaper,  almost  disposable  goods.  IDE  designed  their  low-cost  drip  irrigation  kits with 
this  in mind. One of  their guiding principles  is  to make  sure  the payback  for all  their products  is 
less  than  a  year,  since  people  cannot  be  in  debt  for  too  long  when  their  lives  can  be  so 
unpredictable.  Harish  Hande  is  another  friend  of  Amy’s  who  runs  SELCO  Solar  Company  in 
India,  providing  solar  power  to  low-income  households  and  street  vendors.  Harish  found  that 
people  cannot  afford  to  pay  300  rupees  a  month,  but  they  can  pay  10  rupees  a  day.  It  is 
essential  to  try  to understand  the market and how our  customers are able  to pay,  such as  their 
income and buying habits. Think about structuring  the enterprise  to support people  in paying  for 
what they want, in the same way that car dealers provide financing options. 

Paul often says don’t bother with your project  if you haven’t  talked  to at  least 25 people  living  in 
poverty.  One  of  the  first  thing  he  does  in  the  field  is  to  talk  to  people,  listening  to  try  to 
understand  their  lifestyle,  needs,  behaviors  and  aspirations.  Paul  also  says  don’t  bother  if  you 
cannot  sell  at  least  a  million,  which  has  been  a  controversial  idea.  Amy  counters  this  with  her 
personal belief that it is worth the effort if we can make sustainable change for even one person. 
Paul’s  market  approach  requires  him  to  think  big  and  he  will  not  pursue  technologies  unless 
they  have  the  potential  to  reach  a  wide  market,  like  solar  lanterns,  low-cost  eyeglasses, 
affordable  housing  and  agricultural  technologies  for  common  crops  including  maize,  rice, 
sorghum and cassava. Some students pointed out  that  this  focus would mean  that other needs, 
such  as  those  faced  by  only  a  small  community,  would  then  go  unaddressed.  It  is  clear  that 
while  Paul’s  approach  is  effective,  it  is  only  one  of  many  possible  approaches  in  development 
and it will take many people working together to make this world a better place.
