Announcements: 
There will be a discussion next Monday to reflect on our experiences during the $2 a day activity 
this  week.  It  is  good  to  try  to  understand  what  other  people  go  through  when  they  struggle  to 
meet  their  daily  needs  or  go  hungry  (for  example,  Amy  periodically  fasts  for  Ramadan  even 
though  she  isn’t  of  the  Islamic  faith).  In  today’s  class,  one  of  the  D-Lab  students  from  the 
Zambia  team,  Tim,  made  pancakes  that  he  will  be  selling  for  a  nickel  each  as  part  of  his  
microenterprise.  He  said  he  is  excited,  because  if  he  makes  enough  money  he  may  even  be  
able to afford milk! 

Update from Uganda – Creative Capacity Building Workshop: 
Amy has been in Uganda that past two weeks, running a community workshop. It is best to start 
her  update  by  reviewing  the  ethos  of  D-Lab,  which  has  been  shaped  by  3  movements  in 
development:  Appropriate  Technology,  Participatory  Development,  and  Creative  Capacity 
Building. If Appropriate Technology is the “what” of development and Participatory Development 
is  the  “how,”  then  Creative  Capacity  Building  (CCB)  addresses  the  “who”  by  seeking  to 
empower communities through training people in the design process so that they become active 
creators of technology, not just users or recipients of technology. 

In a spectrum of sustainability, charitable aid 
and  external  donations  are  not  sustainable. 
This  is  not  to  say  that  they  are  necessarily 
good  or  bad  and  it  is  important  to  recognize 
that  they  are  sometimes  needed  in  times  of 
crisis.  Microfinance  and  external  loans  fall 
around  the  middle  of  the  spectrum,  as  they 
help build individual capacity and are moving 
toward 
sustainability.  On 
the  more 
sustainable  end,  we  have  local  leadership 
and  job  creation.  CCB  on  a  community  level 
it  shifts 
would  be  very  sustainable,  as 
people’s  mindsets  so 
they  can 
feel 
empowered  to  become  creators  and  solve 
their  own  problems,  without  waiting 
for 
external intervention or aid. 

CCB  is  a  concept  that  crystallized when  Amy was working  last  year with  graduate  student Kofi 
Taha  in  Northern  Uganda,  where  there  was  a  long  and  brutal  intertribal  war  in  which  children  
were  kidnapped  and  forced  to  fight  against  their  own  village.  In  this  region,  people  are  just 
beginning  to move back  to  their homes after several years of being displaced and  living  in  relief 
camps. There is a great need for technologies that can ease the transition from the dependence 
of  a  refugee  camp  to  a  sustainable  livelihood  in  the  village.  Another  concern  is  that  the  move 
back  to  the  village  will  increase  the  workload  on  women  –  sources  of  water  are  further  away; 
subsistence  crops  need  be  grown  and  processed  because  food  will  no  longer  be  given  away; 

Page 1 of 5 

fuel demand will go  up  and  supplies are  farther away; and  there  is a  great need  to  find ways  to 
produce  income  for  the  family,  as  services  will  longer  being  provided  by  international  relief 
organizations.  Traditionally, women are solely responsible for or participate  in all of these types 
of  work.  Amy  and  Kofi  were  asked  to  demonstrate  some  technologies  that  might  ease  the  
transition,  reduce  the  burden  of  labor,  and  provide  income-generating  activities  to  the  residents 
of transit camps. 

Normally,  when  doing  technology  demonstrations,  D-Lab  finds  a  local  artisan  to  produce  the 
technologies  so  that  they  would  be  available,  should  the  community  want  to  buy  them.  While 
doing  demonstrations  in  the  transit  camps,  however,  Amy  and  Kofi  found  that  the  local 
manufacturing capacity was very  limited.  So  in addition  to showing  these  technologies, another 
goal was  to emphasize  that the residents  themselves could be creators of technologies, not  just 
recipients.  Two  important  underlying  concepts  that  drove  the  designs  were  presented 
throughout  the  demonstrations:  the  first  was  to  make  the  technologies  affordable,  so  that  they 
could be accessible  to people with very  limited  income and resources; the other was  to  take  the 
mystique  away  from  the  technology  design  process  and  show  people  that  technology  is  
something that they could produce themselves. 

Amy  and  Kofi  not  only  demonstrated  how  to make  the  technologies,  but  also wanted  to  enable 
the  people  to  take  part  in  developing  these  technologies.  This  meant  involving  the  community 
not 
just 
in 
identifying 
the  problem  and 
implementing  the  solution,  but  also  in  the  entire 
design  process,  from  gathering  resources  to  idea 
generation,  concept  selection,  building,  testing 
and  refining  the  design  to  better  suit  the  purpose 
and  needs  of  the  users.  Novice  designers  rarely 
go 
through  multiple 
iterations  of 
the  design 
process,  but  Amy  and  Kofi  ran  a  3-day  creativity 
workshop  with  60  people  in  Uganda  to  teach  this 
process  and  illustrate  it  correctly,  using  relevant 
appropriate  technologies  as  examples,  and  a 
series  of  hands-on  activities  to  reinforced  the 
concepts presented. 

The  curriculum  includes  exercises  that  allow  participants  to  practice  both  creating  new 
technologies  and  evolving  and  improving  upon  existing  technologies.  On  each  day,  in  addition 
to  the more  formal design curriculum, participants were given  time  to work on a  “mini-capstone” 
project  which  allowed  them  to  apply  the  concepts  they  learned  and  to  see  how  they  all  fit 
together  in  a  single  project.  A  guiding  principle  for  the  exercises  and  project  was  for  the 
participants  to walk  away with  some  tangible,  useful  technologies  that  they made  in  addition  to 
the new concepts they learned.

One  of  the  introductory  activities  that Amy  ran was  for  people  to work  in  teams  and  brainstorm 
how  to  hold  as  much  corn  off  the  ground  as  possible,  using  only  paper.  The  first  time  she 
explained  the  activity,  she  gave  an  example  to  help  them  understand  the  activity  but may  have 
unintentionally  narrowed  their  thinking  by  doing  so.  Unfortunately,  all  of  the  ideas  that  the 
participants  tried  ended  up  following  her  example.  In  the  second  round  of  the  activity,  she  was 
more careful in her explanation and people came up with many more diverse ideas. 

During  the workshop, participants made corn shellers so  that they would have something useful 
to  take home as well as an opportunity  to work on building skills.  In order  to show  that  the  tools 
used  to make  the  technologies are  just as  important as  the  technologies  themselves, a  team  of 
8  people  would  share  a  single  set  of  tools.  When  Amy  and  Kofi  returned  the  next  day,  there 
were stacks of corn shellers very nicey made. 

The  participants  were  then  challenged  to  go  through  the  entire  design  process  and  make  a 
device  for  threshing  groundnuts. As  an  incentive,  the winning  team would  receive  a  tool  set  for 
making  corn  shellers.  Amy  showed  the  class  videos  of  the  participants  enthusiastically 
presenting  their  designs.  It  was  amazing  to  see  how  quickly  people  became  engaged  in  the 
process  and  how  excited  they  became  about  their  own  creations.  Amy  then  demonstrated  the 
groundnut  threshers  made  during  the  International 
Development  Design  Summit  in  Ghana,  while 
being  careful  to  show  these  designs  as  other 
versions,  rather  than  better  versions,  and  explain 
that  they  were  developed  over  a  much  longer 
period  of  time.  One  design  was  a  mesh  table  and 
Amy challenged the participants to think about how 
for  millet  or 
thresher 
the 
they  would  adapt 
sorghum.  Before, 
the 
community 
threshed 
groundnuts  off  the  root  by  hand  –  this  workshop  
really  helped  to  change  they  way  people  think, 
encouraging  them  to  be  creative  and  develop  their 
own tools and devices for making life easier. 

Participants also tried using a paste maker, gave feedback about what they  liked and didn’t like, 
and  made  suggestions  on  how  to  improve  the  design.  What  is  important  here  is  that  every 
technology shown and used in the workshop is something that people can relate to and use (not 
kumquat  juicers,  in  this  case,  or  anything  equally  obscure).  You  have  to  first  let  people  how  a 

Page 3 of 5 

technology  is  used  and  built,  before  you  talk  about  how  it was  designed.  For  example,  it would 
be  hard  for  people  to  understand  the  design  iterations  of  the  charcoal  press  if  people  are  not 
familiar with the charcoal-making process. 

At  the end of  the workshop, Amy and Kofi collected  feedback by having people  fill out multiple-
choice  surveys  that  do  not  require  people  to  read  or  write.  Participants  had  colored  beans 
representing  different  options  (black  might  mean  they  didn’t  like  it,  light  tan  might  mean  they 
liked the session and got what they expected from it, etc.) and used the beans to show how they 
felt.  Amy  is  actually  eating  the  beans  now  while  she  is  living  off  $2  a  day.  Many  people  kept 
saying  that now  they need  tools, so  the next step might be building community shops so people 
have access to tools along with a space to share and work. 

It was really encouraging to see how  these refugees, who have been victims of war for 30 years 
and who NGOs said would  just wait  to be given  things, got  really engaged  in  the workshop and 
started coming up with their own solutions to address problems  in their community. Technology, 
in  this  case,  is  being  used  as  part  of  the  psychosocial  rehabilitation  efforts.  At  the  end  of  the 
workshop,  perhaps  not  all  60  participants  will  become  makers,  but  at  least  some  participants 
may have realized that they can be inventors and enjoy the process of creating. D-Lab feels that 
CCB  is an  important  new approach  to development work, and one  that  is necessary  in order  for 
there to be true co-creation. If any teams are interested in working on CCB during their fieldwork 
trips in January, they should meet with Amy as she continues to develop this workshop. 

There  is  an  inherent  difficultly  in  doing  work  in  the  classroom  in  the  US  while  wanting  to  have 
intense  community  interactions.  The  student  design  teams  strive  for  good  communication  with 
community  partners  during  the  semester,  however,  this  cannot  replace  the  experience  of 
working side by side, sharing  ideas and building prototypes together. D-Lab works with the view 
that  what  is  done  during  the  fall  class  is  part  of  the  foundation  of  collaboration  with  community 
partners,  and  that  the  important  next  step will  be  for  the  students  to  travel  to  their  partners  and  
work together on the future development of each project.

Concrete Lab: 
In  today’s  class,  we’ll  talk  about  concrete  in  the  abstract  and  then  in  the  concrete.  Although 
many  people  may  use  the  words  interchangeably,  concrete  is  not  the  same  as  cement. 
Concrete  is made with cement  (a binder with  lime, gypsum, etc.), sand and an aggregate  (such 
as gravel), typically  in a ratio of 1:2:3. Porous blocks  for  infiltration wells, on  the other hand, use 
a ratio of 1:2:8 (also  in parts cement to sand  to aggregate). Mortar  is often made of cement and 
sand in a ratio of 1:3 and used as the glue to hold concrete bricks together. 

It  is  critical  that  the  concrete  is  well-mixed  throughout  the  process  of  making  it  (before  adding 
water,  while  adding  water,  and  after  adding  water).  One  technique  for  making  concrete  in  the 
field  is  to mix  the  dry  ingredients  on  the  ground  with  a  shovel  and make  a  little  volcano  to  hold 
the water. After the water  is added, mix well to  incorporate  it in the mixture evenly. Many people 
think  they know how  to make concrete, but probably do not. Remember  to always mix well, mix 
well, and mix well! 

Another  important  point  is  that  concrete  doesn’t  dry;  it  sets. When  concrete  sets,  it  crystallizes. 
This  is  why  concrete  needs  to  be  kept  wet,  so  that  water  molecules  in  the  matrix  can  form 
crystalline  bonds.  In  other words, water molecules  are  part  of  the  chemical process  that makes 
concrete hard. The  longer  the concrete  is wet,  the stronger  it can become  (for example, marine 
concrete  used  for  pylons  in  water  can  continue  to  gain  strength  for  up  to  20  years).  Good 
practice is to keep it wet for a minimum of a couple days up to a full week. Try hard not to let the 
concrete dry out! 

Now the c lass is ready to go make concrete and d iscuss it concretely. One group will be making 
peanut  shellers  using  molds  developed  by  the  Full  Belly  Project,  one  group  will  be  making 
porous  blocks  for  infiltration  wells,  one  group  will  be  making  a  latrine  slab  (which  has  to  be  
strong), and one group will be making a  charcoal crusher  that was developed by a  team  during 
the  2008  International  Development  Design  Summit  (shown  below).  Each  country  team  will 
have  its members  split  among  the  different  groups,  so  that  the  team  as  a whole  can  build  up  a 
wider range of experience.
