Susan  Murcott  is  a  senior  lecturer  in  civil  and  environmental  engineering  who  works  on  water 
and wastewater  treatment  technologies  in developing countries. During  the 1990s, her research 
and  professional  consulting  practice  focused  on  innovations  in  wastewater  treatment  for 
megacities  in  Mexico,  Brazil,  Eastern  Europe  and  China.  Since  1998,  she  has  led  multi-
disciplinary  teams  on  household  water  treatment  and  safe  storage  projects  in  Nepal,  Haiti, 
Nicaragua,  Dominican  Republic,  Brazil,  Peru,  Kenya,  Ghana,  Bangladesh  and  Cambodia 
through  the  MIT  Civil  and  Environmental  Engineering  Masters  of  Engineering  Program.  These 
initiatives  are  part  of  her  larger  effort  to  train  MIT  students  as  water  professionals  and  global 
citizens  and  to  assist  in  bringing  safe  drinking  water  and  sanitation  to  the  developing  world 
through “Safe Water for 1 Billion People” (http://web.mit.edu/watsan).  
 
How many people lack safe water in the world? Students in the class guessed 2 billion, 1 billion, 
and  1.1  billion,  but we  really  do  not  know  the  exact  number. We  are  from  the water  rich world, 
but even our part of the world has historically faced water-borne diseases. Susan’s grandmother 
was born in 1890 and contracted polio when she was in her teens, becoming paralyzed from the 
waist down. This lecture will be more about the water poor regions of the world. According to the 
United Nations, “1.1 billion people lack access to an improved water supply.” Improved supply in 
this  case means  piped water,  public  taps,  tube wells/boreholes,  protected  dug wells/springs,  or 
rainwater harvesting.  It  refers  to  infrastructure  improvements as a step  towards safe water. The 
UN  keeps  its  statistics  this  way  because  water  testing  has  been  traditionally  costly,  so  it  is 
easier to measure infrastructure over water quality. 
 
On  the  other  hand,  unimproved  water  supply  refers  to  surface  water,  unprotected  dug 
wells/springs,  tanker  trucks/carts  and  other  vended  water.  Unprotected  water  sources  such  as 
dug wells  risk  contamination  from  surface  run-off,  animal  feces,  and  contact with  contaminated 
containers.  Does  an  improved  water  supply  necessarily  provide  safe  water?  Would  you  drink 
the tap water from a major city in the developing world such Nairobi or Mexico City, even though 
it  is  piped  water?  Foreigners,  the  sick,  the  young  and  the  elderly  are  especially  vulnerable  to 
bacteria  in  piped water,  even  if  it  is  technically  an  “improved  supply.” What  is  the  biggest  issue 
with  distribution?  Contamination  is  an  issue,  because  water  can  leave  the  treatment  center

clean  enough  and  then  get  contaminated  via  infiltration  into  the  piped  system.  Contamination 
can also be an issue during animal/human distribution with non-piped systems. 
 
When it comes to water quality, water can be contaminated in 4 broad categories: 
•  Physical/Aesthetic 
•  Microbiological 
•  Chemical 
•  Radionuclides 
Microbiological contamination  is  the most serious because  it can kill you  faster and  leads  to  the 
most widespread infectious diseases. Chemical contamination is the second most serious issue. 
These primary contaminants have a direct impact on your health. 
 
The  latest  data  shows  that  about  0.9  billion  people  lack 
access  to  improved water supplies, with over 746 million 
living  in  rural areas and urban/peri-urban  slums. Women 
and  children  are  most  profoundly  impacted  by  water 
quality  and  water  scarcity.  Women  shoulder  the  largest 
burden  in  collecting  water,  and  are  also  the  primary 
caretaker  when  children  or  other  family  members  suffer 
from  water-borne  diseases.  The  leading  infectious  killers 
are  lower  respiratory  infections,  HIV/AIDS  and  diarrheal 
diseases. Diarrheal diseases mostly affect children under 
5,  affecting  almost  as  many  children  as  lower  respiratory  infections  and  many  more  than 
HIV/AIDS.  Diarrhea  causes  20%  of  all  mortalities  for  young  children  and  can  lead  to  stunting 
and malnourishment. 
 
There  is  an  environmental  disease  burden:  24%  of  the  global  disease  burden  and  23%  of  all 
deaths  are  attributed  to  environmental  factors.  This  is  why  environmental  engineers  are  so 
important.  Diarrhea  is  overwhelming  caused  by  environmental  factors.  The  4  major  categories 
of environmental interventions to address water-related disease are: 
•  Quantity: ex. if you have enough to cleanse your hands before eating 
•  Quality: ex. treating pathogens in water 
•  Sanitation: ex. reducing the amount of human/animal feces that contaminate the water 
•  Hygiene: ex. washing hands and vegetables before eating 
All of these can make an impact on environmental causes of disease. 
 
Susan  began  her  training  by  working  in  megacities  of  the  world,  such  as  Beijing  and  Mexico 
City,  but  in  the  last  12  years,  she  has  mostly  been  working  on  small  scale  systems  with  the 
M.Eng.  program.  Through  her  experience  as  a  consultant  in  Myanmar,  Susan  realized  that 
systems  need  to  be  community  or  household  scale  because  it  could  be  costly  to  implement  a 
large  system  in  rural  areas.  This  is  especially  true  where  there  may  not  be  the  necessary 
infrastructure, such as electricity needed  to power pumps  in  large systems. For example,  it cost 
$1  billion  just  to  upgrade  a  water  system  for  2.9  million  people  in  Boston,  Massachusetts. 
Imagine how costly  it would be  to provide water  to a  large number of people  in a  rural area of a 
developing country.

What are some small-scale drinking water  treatment and 
safe  storage  technologies?  A  cluster  of  innovative 
technologies  have  been  invented  and  disseminated 
within  the  last  15  years.  These  are  distinct  from  first 
world  post-tap  technologies  like  the  Brita  Filter  because 
those  usually  start  with  safe  water  as  an  input  and 
improve aesthetic quality,  such as appearance and  taste 
by removing chlorine. There are many known methods of 
household  water  disinfection,  such  as  solar  disinfection, 
chlorination, and boiling, which people started advocating 
worldwide 
the  1950s.  Boiling  only  addresses 
in 
microbiological  contamination  threats,  however,  so  Susan  has  invented  the  Kanchan  filter, 
which  can  remove  chemical  contaminants  such  as  arsenic  and  is  being  disseminated  in 
Southern Nepal. 

 
To  remove  particles,  we  can  use  ceramic  water 
filters,  biosand  filters  and  coagulation/precipitation 
methods.  Several  traditional  practices  are  effective, 
such  as  stone  filters  that  have  been  used  in  Peru 
since  the  1600s,  but  it  is  a  relatively  new  practice  to 
study 
traditional  practices 
for  designing  water 
treatment  technologies. Another example  is  the cloth 
filter.  Sari  cloth  has  been  used  in  India  since  500 
B.C.  and  is  effective  against  cholera  and  guinea 
worm.  Guinea  worm  is  now  only  endemic  to  5 
countries  but  started  off  affecting  more  than  26 
million people.  

 
It  is  hard  to  come  up  with  a  one-size-fits-all  treatment 
because  of  the  many  different  characteristics  of  water, 
such  as  temperature,  pH  and  geologies  of  water  basins. 
There  are  many  combined  systems  out  there,  such  as 
the  PUR  water  packet  designed  by  Proctor  &  Gamble 
(P&G)  for  the  developing  world.  It  is  called  a  treatment 
plant  in a packet because  it has a coagulant and chlorine 
as  a  disinfectant,  but  some  still  consider  it  a  little  costly. 
To  use  it,  you  pour  the  packet  contents  in  a  10L  bucket 
and  then  rapidly mix  it. P&G has a  safe water  foundation 
because  they  found  that  these  products  do  not  make 
much  money  but  still  wanted  to  provide  them.  D-Lab  teams  will  get  a  chance  to  try  out  PUR 
packets on Charles River water at the next meeting. Beyond treatment, safe storage is also very 
important  because  water  can  become  re-contaminated  through  unhygienic  behaviors  or  other

exposure  to  contaminants  during  transport  and  storage.  Some  examples  of  small-scale  safe 
storage technologies include lidded plastic and clay pots. 
 
Susan  passes  several  water  technologies  around  the  room,  including  the  ceramic  water  filter 
and  PUR  packets,  while  sharing  how  she  realized  that  there  are  many  technologies  that  work 
but  there  is  no  silver  bullet.  There  are  also  less  effective  small-scale  technologies  out  there, 
such as the LifeStraw, which often clogs and is very costly but has been distributed for free. The 
biggest  challenge  has  been  establishing  the  right  network  to  get  the  appropriate  devices 
implemented. Susan  is now working with  the  International Network  to Promote Safe Household 
Water Treatment and Storage  (HWTS), a public-private partnership hosted by  the World Health 
Organization (WHO). 
 
Recently,  Susan  has  founded  a  social  enterprise  called  Pure  Home Water  in  Ghana,  after  she 
was  not  allowed  to  take  students  to Nepal  in  2003  for  safety  and  stability  reasons. Her  team  is 
based outside of Tamale, the capital of a northern state in Ghana, where the average turbidity of 
the  water  is  690  NTU.  For  comparison,  many 
professionals  have  never  encountered  above 
100  NTU.  The  water  is  hard  to  treat  since  the 
turbidity  is off the chart and the particles protect 
microbes  from  being  disinfected  by  chlorine. 
The 
team 
tried  several  water 
treatment 
products  but many  didn’t  work  because  of  high 
turbidity  or  were  difficult  to  market  well.  They 
ended  up  choosing  ceramic  pot  filters  because 
of  their  effectiveness  in  high  turbidity  and  the 
clean appearance of  the outputted water, which 
also  tested  clean.  The  team  currently  uses 
different  sales  strategies  in  rural  and  urban  areas,  ranging  from  direct  sales  to  emergency 
distributions  with  UNICEF  in  response  to  floods  and  guinea  worm  outbreaks.  The  plan  is  to 
reach  1  million  people  in  5  years  and  have  their  own  factory  to  manufacture  the  filters  locally, 
which would  reduce  the cost  from $15 per pot and  improve quality control. The current supplier 
is  in  construction  materials,  so  filters  are  only  a  side 
business  for  them.  Monitoring  is  difficult  and  it  is  hard  to 
learn  the  true situation, but at  least  the monitoring process 
allows  the  team  to  learn  more  than  if  they  had  never 
showed  up.  Producing  locally  also  helps  address  the 
breakage issue, which often happens during transport from 
the  national  capital  city  of  Accra  (40%  of  500  pots  broke 
during  the  first  time  and  people  even  bike  the  filters  right 
now).  The  “flowerpot”  shape  is  standard  for  ceramic water 
filters,  but  the  team  is  also  testing  a  “salad  bowl”  shape 
which may be harder to break and easier to stack.

Citizen Water EC Kit Demonstration: 
Susan  has  also  brought  in  an  EC  Kit  to  show  the  class.  The  kit  facilitates 
water  testing  for  bacterial  contamination  in  the  field  and  is made  and  sold 
by Citizen Water, an  initiative  that emerged  from her work and  the work of 
her  students.  The  kit  includes  Colilert,  a  presence-absence  test  for 
coliforms  and  fecal  coliforms,  and  quantitative  Petrifilm  coliform  count 
plates  for  people  to  get  a  sense  of  how  contaminated  the  water  may  be. 
Both  tests can be  incubated at human body  temperature by wearing  them 
in cloth belt with built-in pockets.  
 
Citizen Water has since evolved  into a business after going  through  the Development Ventures 
class  and  entering  into  the  MIT  $100K  competition.  Another  major  project  of  theirs  is  global 
mapping  of  water  systems,  including  source  upgrades  as  well  as  treatment  solutions,  using 
Google Earth. You can check out their page on Facebook. They are currently  looking for people 
to help improve their website interface before the January IAP session.
