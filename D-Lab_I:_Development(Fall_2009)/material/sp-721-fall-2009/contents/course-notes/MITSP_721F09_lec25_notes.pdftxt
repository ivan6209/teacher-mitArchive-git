D-Lab: Development 
SP.721 Fall 2009 
Human Rights & Development Planning 
Guest Speaker: Professor Balakrishnan Rajagopal, Urban Studies & Planning 

Class Outline for November 4, 2009: 
•	  Discussion of Drowned Out 
•	 Presentation by Balakrishnan Rajagopal 

Discussion of Drowned Out: 
Class starts off by dividing into country teams. Each group is asked to discuss a theme from the 
film Drowned Out and come up with at  least one question  for  today’s speaker. The  themes  that 
students discuss include: 
•	  Class 
•	  Human Cost 
•	  Politics 
•	 Equity vs. Efficiency 
•	  Accountability 
of  Government, 
Multilateral  Organizations,  Private 
Sector… 
International  Pressure  from  Human 
Rights Organizations, World Bank… 
•	 Protesting & Power of the Masses 
•	 Power of the Media 

•  Voice/Agency 
•  Education 
•  Representation 
and  Preventing 
Marginalization – How? 
•  Corruption of Centralized Power 
•  Rhetoric of Poverty Alleviation 
•  Tribal Rights 
•  Heritage 
•  Eminent Domain 

•	

Eminent  domain  is  an  important  concept  in  urban  studies  which  refers  to  when  government 
takes  land  away  from  the  owners  in  order  to  do  something  for  the  “public  good.”  It  can  be 
controversial, because “public good” can mean different things to different people. 

Questions that the class comes up with included: 
•	 How  can  the  international  community  use  their  leverage  to  affect  situations  like  this? 
How can they affect policy? 
•	 What  checks  can  be  put  on  the  government  to  ensure  accountability?  Where  can  the 
checks  come  from?  In  a  democratic  government,  the  theory  is  that  this  should  come 
from  the  people. Can we  build  them  into  a  country’s  own  governmental  structure?  If  the 
checks do not come from within the country, what can the international community do? 

Presentation by Balakrishnan Rajagopal:

Professor  Balakrishnan  Rajagopal  is  part  of  the  International  Development  Group  (IDG)  in  the 
Department  of  Urban  Studies  and  Planning  (DUSP).  In  the  past,  he  assisted  the  World 
Commission on Dams to develop a  legal and policy framework on the human rights  implications 
of  large  dams  and  has  consulted with  UNDP  on  the  articulation  of  a  human  rights  approach  to 
development  planning  and  policy.  He  formerly  served  with  the  United  Nations  High 
Commissioner  for Human Rights  in Cambodia between 1992-97. He has  lectured on economic 
and  social  rights  at  the  Institute  for  International  Judges  and  on  housing  rights  in Porto Alegre, 
Brazil.  His  research  is  focused  primarily  on  South  and  Southeast  Asia  and  also  on  the  legal

systems of Brazil and South Africa. His caveat for this presentation on the Narmada Dam is that 
50 minutes is not enough time to fully discuss a case of this complexity. 

In  the  dry  states  of  India,  there  is  an  interest  in  damming  rivers  to  provide  drinking  water  and 
irrigation.  The  states  were  in  dispute  about  water  rights  and  usage,  so  they  had  to  go  to  an 
interstate  water  dispute  tribunal.  82%  of  India’s  river  water  is  in  the  form  of  interstate  river 
basins.  States  have  generally  been  able  to  meet  and  arrive  at  their  own  consensus  on  how  to 
share the water, but the constitution provides a special tribunal that issues a binding ruling in the 
case of disputes.

Several massive dam projects were planned since before India gained its independence, but the 
first  foundation  stones were  laid  in  the  early  1950s.  These  dams were  transnational  projects  at 
the  start,  with  the  involvement  of many  international  organizations  and  corporations.  Hundreds 
of  dams  were  being  built  along  the  same  river,  mainly  in  the  states  of  Madhya  Pradesh  and 
Maharashtra. The majority of the flooding would occur in Madhya Pradesh. Initially, people living 
in  the  affected  valleys  were  only  requesting  information.  They  wanted  to  see  the  project 
documents  for  the  dams,  understand  where  the  flooding  was  coming  from  and  learn  about 
compensation packages. The government spoke much of  rehabilitation and  resettlement  (R&R) 
of  displaced  peoples,  but  those  affected  were met  with  complete  refusal  from  the  states  about 
sharing plans. This hardened the resolve of the local people at risk of displacement. 

Why  has  there  been  so much  controversy? For  that we  need  to  go  back  to  some basic  issues. 
The  first  issue  has  to  do  with  the  place  of  dams  in  developing  countries,  such  as  India.  India 
saw  dams  as  one  of  the main ways  to  achieve  growth  and  economic  development  in  the  post-
independence  era.  Prime  Minister  Nehru  called  the  dams  “temples  of  modern  development.” 
They  provided  a  sense  of  nationalism,  a  sense  of  wanting  to  use  development  to  build  the 
nation. This would be a high stakes controversy, where people on both sides are full of passion. 
In India, any criticism of large dams is often considered to be anti-nationalism. Any open support 
for large dams, however, could also be considered to be repression and almost Fascist. 

The  official  purpose  of  the  Narmada  dam  was  described  as  a mixture  of  flood  control,  drinking 
water provision and  irrigation. We must also recognize that there was another unstated purpose 
here  that  was  connected  to  the  political  economy  of  the  region:  supporting  industries  that may 
be  very  water-intensive.  For  example, 
the 
“golden  corridor” 
in  Gujarat  has  many 
pharmaceuticals and chemical production companies. Most of  the dam water used  in Gujarat  is 

Page 2 of 5 

actually  used  for  industrial  purposes  and  diverted  to  the  cities,  even  though  the  dam 
construction was sold as a project for rural development. 

There  are  also  complicated  dynamics  playing  out  in  different  places  of  the world.  For  example, 
Greenpeace  in  Japan  has  been  putting  pressure  on  the  Japanese  government  to  back  off  on 
extending the loan for generators on the project. The World Bank has been a major international 
funder  and  technical  supporter  of  the  project  since  the  1980s.  Local  involvement  is  very 
complex as well. The  first dam has been  the  source of  the most political  conflict on  the ground. 
Virtually every dam built afterward has faced similar conflicts and issues in implementation. 

There  are  governments  of  various  levels  that have overlapping  responsibilities  concerning dam 
construction.  Water  provision  is  often  done  by  state  governments,  but  the  federal  government 
has  control  over  interstate  water  systems.  Resettlement  is  managed  by  state  governments 
because  they  have  control  of  land  allocation,  but  the  federal  government  answers  to 
international  donors  such  as  the  World  Bank.  It  is  not  easy  to  get  political  consensus  in  a 
country  that  diverts  political  structure.  In  1979,  there was  a  progressive  tribunal  ruling  that  said 
for  the  first  time  that  people  displaced  by  the  construction  would  receive  land  for  land,  as 
opposed  to  cash  compensation.  This  is  significant  for  a  country  with  a  substantial  rural 
population  that  depends  on  land  for  cultivation.  Cash  is  much  harder  for  them  to  utilize,  and 
many people who receive cash end up migrating and living with the urban poor.

The construction of the Narmada dam has raised concerns over: 
•  Hydrology 
•  Health 
•  Safety 
•  Environment 
•  Human Rights 

Hydrology  deals  with  the  question  of  how  much  water  is  there  to  share.  It  turns  out  that  even 
scientists  cannot  really  agree  on  a  precise  number  in  this  case.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
measured  data  for  Narmada  is  not  sufficient  for  an  accurate  prediction,  especially  for  a  region 
with  such  variance  in  water  flows.  The  states  that  stand  to  benefit  the most  from  the  river,  like 
Gujarat, of course want to keep the number small so there  is  less to share. The states that wish 
to  receive  water  want  to  use  the  highest  scientifically  defensible  number  in  negotiations  for 
sharing.

As  for health,  there are studies pointing out  that  the shift  in  the  flow of  the  river could  lead  to an 
increase in malaria transmission through mosquitoes. 

The  safety  issue  is  always  there,  and  technically  speaking  it  has  not  been  resolved.  In  2001, 
there was a massive earthquake where  thousands died. We do not know what will happen  from 
building hundreds of dams in a small area where millions of people live. 

When  it  comes  to  the  environment,  the  government  is  concerned  with  threats  to  the many  fish 
species.  It  was  said  that  this  could  be  mitigated  through  constructing  special  features  to  allow 
the passage of fish. 

With human rights, there is the question of what to do with Project-Affected People (PAPs). Who 
counts  as  a  PAP?  In  the  most  obvious  cases,  this  includes  people  who  were  flooded  out  and 
people  who  own  property  titles  in  the  flood  area.  The  problem  is  that  this  does  not  include 
landless  people  who  do  service  jobs  in  the  flood  area,  such  as  laborers  who  pick  corn 
seasonally  for small  farmers or  fishermen. How do you compensate people appropriately? Who 
is considered displaced/affected? How do you give people  land  for  land, when  some people do 
not  own  land  in  the  first  place?  They  need  access  to  work  and  rights  to  their  livelihood.  The 
other question  is who are  the owners? A  lot of people who  “own”  the property have  lived  in  the 
tribal areas for several generations. There is community recognition of ownership, so there is no 
need  for  formal  property  deeds.  This  leads  to  tribal  people  being  unable  to  prove  ownership  of 
ancestral  homes  to  the  government.  According  to  the  government  provisions,  which  are  more 
observed  in their breach, tribal  lands cannot be touched without the pre-informed consent of the 
residing  tribal people. People ask what  is  the use of  “land  for  land”  if  the  land  received  is 30 km 
away  from  the  forests  where  they  gather  herbs  for  medicine?  The  concept  of  land  here  is 
connected  with  the  surrounding  ecology.  Often,  the  relocation  area  does  not  have  the  same 
ecology as the original land. Part of the problem is that people do not even know what dams are 
coming and which regions will be flooded. 

The  rest  of  the  lecture  is  about  recent  developments  and  the  current  status  of  the  Narmada 
Dam. In 1994, the Indian Supreme Court issued a stay on construction, but reversed its decision 
and  allowed  the  project  to  continue  in  2000.  Complaints  have  continued  to  be  raised  to  the 
Supreme Court.  In 2005,  the Supreme Court clarified  its  ruling  to  include a method  for states  to 
hear  and  process  complaints.  People  argue  that  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment/Report 
(EIA/EIR)  filed  the  by  the  Indian  government  was  not  properly  done  and  if  a  true  EIA/EIR  had 
been completed, the project would not have been approved by the World Bank. 

The World  Bank  has  violated  its  own  policies  when  it  approved  the  project  the  first  place.  The 
rules  of  the  World  Bank  are  that  R&R  needs  to  be  considered  beforehand,  (specifically, 
resettlement  land needs  to be  identified before  the project  commences) and  that  the number of 
people  displaced  needs  to  be  minimized.  With  the  Narmada  case,  quality  land  has  not  been 
readily  available  and  available  land  is  sold  at  market  prices,  which  are  unaffordable  for  the 
government  to  buy.  The  World  Bank  also  stipulates  that  detailed  surveys  and  community 
consultations need  to be completed  for effective planning. To  these considerations, Balakrishna 
add  the  need  for  exploring  alternatives  which  do  not  involve  so  much  risk  to  the  environment 
and human rights. 

Due  to  international  criticism,  the World  Bank  ended  up  ordering  an  independent  evaluation  of 
its own project  for  the  first  time and delivered a  scathing  criticism.  Its own  conclusion drawn up 
for  the  OED  report  is  that  the  Bank’s  performance  was  “unsatisfactory.”  This  has  changed  the 
organization  of  the  World  Bank.  A  World  Bank  Complaints  Panel  was  established  in  1994 

Page 4 of 5 

to  allow  the  Bank  to  communicate  with  the  people  who  are  affected  by  projects.  In  2000,  The 
World Commission  issued a  report on how  to plan  for  large dams,  including best practices. The 
World  Bank  even  pulled  out  of  its  own  project  in  2003.  These may  seem  like  weak  responses, 
but they would never have happened otherwise. 

Large  dams  have  provided  immense  benefits,  but  these  benefits  have  not  always  been  what 
was promised and often come at unacceptable and unnecessary consequences. So, do we stop 
building dams? Maybe we cannot stop entirely, but we can build them in a smarter way. 

Every large scale dam project in Balakrishna’s experience has resulted in administration/political 
paralysis on  the ground, overrun budgets/schedules,  failure  to deliver all  the benefits promised, 
and  serious  unintended  consequences.  Balakrishna  says  he  is  personally  a  skeptic  when  it 
comes  to  very  large  dam  projects,  but  he  does  believe  that  sizeable  dams  have  a  place. Small 
dams  done  by  the  community  themselves  may  not  achieve  the  scale  necessary  for  countries 
with  large population, demands and needs. Sometimes  you need  large dams  for drinking water 
in  dry  regions  or  for  larger  scale  irrigation  to  produce  enough  food.  The  trick  is  how  to  balance 
all the  interests. There are ways to  improve project planning and  implementation to pose  less of 
a threat to the environment and human rights. 

Balakrishna  invites  students  to  attend  his  office  hours  if  they want  to  discuss  this  case  in more 
detail, or talk about other development issues.
