•  Case Studies: PeePoo and PlayPump 

 
History of Development (Continued): 
Last  time,  Bish  talked  about  some  different  dimensions  of  development:  the  social  and 
economic  aspects,  the  political  aspects  and  the  technological  aspects.  You  can  imagine  that 
after World War  II,  people  had  visions  of  emerging  independent  nations moving  out  of  colonial 
rule with large-scale technological innovation. It did not exactly happen as people had hoped.  
 
As  a  class,  we  can  discuss  some  reasons  why  development  did  not  happen  the  way  people 
envisioned.  There  was  a  lot  of  corruption  and  inequality  that  did  not  get  reduced  over  time.  In 
many cases,  the elite ended up getting  richer and  the poor ended up getting poorer. Jobs were 
not created  to  the extent  that we needed. Mass migration  to  the cities was encouraged, but  the 
jobs  did  not  necessarily materialize  as  promised.  Technology  infrastructure  did  not  advance  as 
much  as  necessary  for  supporting  urban  industries.  We  cannot  really  take  advantage  of  the 
cheap  labor  force  and  spur mass  production without  good  roads  to  transport  the materials  and 
products.  The  decrease  in  agricultural  labor  as  people migrated  to  the  cities  was  compounded 
by an  increase  in population,  leading  to strains on  the  food supply. Many  resources were being 
depleted  in  rural  areas.  Industries  were  dominated  by  monopolies  that  extracted  resources 
without  developing  in-country  capacity.  Several  countries  ended  up  with  authoritarian  regimes, 
rather  than  the  democratic  structures  that  we  wanted  to  thrive.  It  was  complicated  because 
colonialism  took  away  much  of  the  functioning  tribal  or  indigenous  leadership.  The  regional 
imbalances 
from  unstable  government  and 
tribal/ethnic 
tensions  discouraged 
foreign 
investment.  Prior  to  the  1970’s,  researchers  were  looking  at  macroeconomic  indicators,  not  as 
much  at  the  human  indicators  like  the  statistics  on  health  and  education  from  the  World  Fact 
Quiz  in  the  first class.  It  is also  important  to remember  that  the  informal sector  is  larger  than  the 
formal  sector  of  employment  in  many  countries,  but  is  not  considered  in  most  of  the  statistics 
from  multilateral  organizations.  Take  India,  for  example,  where  much  of  the  food  is  purchased 
locally  from  subsistence-level  smallholder  farmers  and  sellers.  There  is  often  this  perception 
that  decentralized  farming  is  not  working  from  looking  at  the  numbers,  and  yet  interestingly 
there is now a movement back toward supporting local agriculture in the US where food is being 
transported  long  distances  through  cold  storage  infrastructure.  If  we  have  learned  anything  for 
sure,  it  is that no single factor  is going  to end global poverty. We cannot say  that poverty will be 
eliminated  by  job  creation,  because we  still  need  a  healthcare  system,  access  to markets,  and 
so  forth.  Bish  reminds  us  that  we  need  institutions  for  development,  but  while  government  is 
important, it cannot do everything on it’s own. Likewise, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) 
play  an  important  role,  but  are  also  not  as  effective  if working  alone. Organization  is  important, 
but it is more complicated than that. 
 
In 1973, a very  influential collection of essays was published by E. F. Schumacher called Small 
is Beautiful: A Study  of  Economics  as  if People Mattered which  challenged  the  idea  that  larger 
scale  and  increased  productivity  are  paramount  to  development.  Schumacher  argues  that  it  is 
important  for people  to  feel  like  they are doing meaningful work and  take pride  in  it,  rather  than 
only push for automation and higher throughput. This set the stage for moving in a direction that 
takes  into account  the human aspect, and not simply  financial success. For example,  there has 
been  increasing  attention  on  concepts  such  as  the  triple  bottom  line, which  looks  at  the  impact 
on people, planet and prosperity.

Intermediate Technology: 
From  this  shift  in  perception  toward more  holistic  approaches, what  started  to  emerge was  this 
concept  of  intermediate  and  appropriate  technologies.  There  are  several  ways  in  which 
technologies  are  considered  to  be  intermediate:  1)  in  price,  and  2)  in  time,  as  some 
technologies are meant to be transitional and support people in moving from manual labor using 
hand  tools  to  large-scale  mechanized  technology.  Take  pressing  peanut  oil  as  an  example, 
where  the  existing  technologies might  be  an  indigenous method  of  pressing  oil  by  hand, which 
is  both  time-consuming  and  labor-intensive,  and  mechanized  oil  presses  at  the  other  extreme, 
which may require a very high capital investment of thousands of dollars and infrastructure such 
as electricity.  In  this  situation, an  intermediate  technology might be a $200  ram press  that uses 
a  lever  to  press  out  oil  with  more  force  than  current  manual  methods,  helping  to  improve  the 
speed and output of  the production process. Similarly, a $375 press  that produces 500 bricks a 
day can be considered intermediate technology in helping with the transition from molding bricks 
by hand to using an industrial brick maker that costs $23,000 and produces 10,000 bricks a day. 
 
Another example of intermediate technology is the treadle 
pump,  which  enables  farmers  to  provide  a  greater 
amount  of  water  to  their  plants  more  easily  compared  to 
watering  by  bucket,  while 
requiring  much 
less 
infrastructure than constructing  irrigation dams and pipes. 
Other  examples  include  a  mixed  method  of  making 
roofing  tiles  that  utilizes  both  motorized  machinery  and 
manual  work.  One  workshop  that  is  using  this  method  is 
run  by  a  cooperative  of  women  who  have  been  widowed 
and  socially  ostracized. These women  have  been  able  to 
sell  every  tile  they  make  and  transport  to  market, 
themselves  and  be 
to  support 
them 
enabling 
independent. 
In 
this  case,  one  of 
the 
immediate 
limitations  is  actually  transport  rather  than  production, 
since  the  cooperative  is  at  the  bottom  of  a  hill  and  the 
women have to get the tiles to market. 
 
There  is  an  interesting  niche  here,  as  intermediate  technologies  work  when  it  is  too  expensive 
for mass manufacturers to get their larger-scale technologies to certain communities because of 
diminishing  economies  of  scale.  Intermediate  technologies  are  more  affordable  and  can  be 
more  decentralized,  helping  to  bridge  that  last  mile  of  distribution.  Additionally,  where  specific 
skilled  labor  is  required,  intermediate  technologies may  have  an  important  place.  For  example, 
you can imagine that it may not make sense to use a mechanical combine for flower picking. 
 
Appropriate Technology: 
What makes a technology appropriate? Students threw out areas of consideration such as: 
•  Need 
•  Maintainability, reparability 
•  Affordability 
•  Quality 
•  Benefits, such as increased 
•  Local materials, local production 
production
•  Low ecological impact 
•  Cultural acceptability, 
appropriateness for social context 
•  Fit within infrastructural environment 
•  Transparency, understandability 
•  Ease of use, match to local skills 
•  Durability, reliability

Connecting  back  to  the  roots  of  this movement  from Small  is Beautiful,  the  traditional  definition 
of appropriate technology also includes creating meaningful jobs, using decentralized renewable 
energy,  small-scale,  and  open  source  as  part  of  its  ethos.  Each  of  these  areas  could  be 
explored in much more depth than we have time for today. If you are interested in continuing the 
discussion, take a look at the D-Lab: Design course that is offered in the spring. 
 

An example of appropriate technology is the sari cloth filter. 
It  was  found  that  the  transmission  of  cholera  could  be 
reduced  by  50%  during  an  outbreak  if  people  fold  a  sari 
(women’s clothing  in  India) several  times and use  it  to  filter 
water.  This  is  something  that  is  low-cost,  simple,  locally 
available,  easy  to  implement  and  yet  has  an  incredible 
potential  for  positive  impact  –  what  is  important  here  is 
knowledge transfer. Also, every technology has its limits so 
there  is  a  need  to  communicate  the  limits  of  the  sari  cloth 
filter  as  well.  Cholera  bacteria  is  much  bigger  than  other 
bacteria and viruses, so this type of filtration cannot ensure

Foundation. 
 
Another  commonly  cited  example  of  appropriate 
technology is the pot-in-pot evaporative cooler. It works by 
having  a  pot within  a  pot,  separated  by  a  layer  of  dirt  that 
can  be  moistened,  so  the  interior  is  cooled  as  the  water 
evaporates.  In  these  pots,  vegetables  can  last  2-3  weeks 
without  refrigeration  instead  of  just  a  few  days,  enabling 
households  to  store  food  longer.  The  coolers  also  enable 
farmers  to  wield  more  negotiating  power  and  command 
better  prices  in  the  market  by  helping  to  reduce  the 
pressure  to  sell  before  the  vegetables  go  bad.  Local 
potters  can  be 
trained 
to  make 
these 
“desert 
refrigerators,”  but  the  key  word  is  “desert”  because  this 
technique works much better in areas of low humidity. The 
pot-in-pot  coolers  do  not  work  as  well  during  the  wet 
season  or  in  certain  climates,  and  can  be  difficult  to 
transport.  In  Nigeria,  a  teacher  from  a  family  of  potters 
named  Mohammed  Boh  Abba  developed  these  coolers  utilizing  locally  available  materials  and 
traditional knowledge. There are now  tens of  thousands of  these pots  in Nigeria and other parts 
of  the  world,  and  the  teacher  has  also  done  well  for  himself  with  a  university  appointment  and 
several awards. 
 
The definition of appropriate can also change based what support infrastructure is available. For 
example, Whirlwind makes wheelchairs out of materials  that may not have  fit  into  the  traditional 
definition  of  locally  available  –  yet  if  something  is  available  locally,  then  it  is  locally  available. 
The bearings in Whirlwind’s wheelchairs are actually old bearings from ceiling fans, but they can 
be  sourced  locally  instead  of  imported.  Whirlwind  engages  local  labor  in  taking  advantage  of 
locally available resources, rather than limiting themselves to raw materials that can be grown or 
dug  up.  There  is  certainly  a  lot  of  skill  from  indigenous  manufacturing,  but  sometimes  the 
existing  infrastructure  can  support  more  and  we  do  not  have  to  constrain  ourselves  to  the 
traditional  definition  of  appropriate.  Plastic  sheets  may  soon  start  to  be  considered  a  locally

available  material,  as  new  supply  chains  are  being  built  up  and  communities  are  starting  to 
accumulate more plastic waste to recycle into sheets. 
 
There are many other examples of organizations taking advantage of the evolving infrastructure, 
or  even  developing  their  own  infrastructure  to  help  support  certain  technologies.  When  solid-
state  white  LEDs  (light-emitting  diodes)  first  came  out,  they  were  about  $12  each.  An 
organization  called  Light  Up  the  World  would  purchase  lower-quality  white  LEDs,  which  might 
have  had  a  lifetime  of  around  10,000  hours  instead  of  over  20,000  hours,  and  then  assemble 
small  circuit  boards  locally  to  make  small  lights  for  housing  and  street-side  vendors.  Iqbal 
Quadir  started  a  movement  called  Grameen  Phone  to  provide  phone  service  in  rural 
Bangladesh.  Interestingly,  he  had  to  start  a  telecom  company  to  do  it  because  the  necessary 
infrastructure was  not  there  yet.  It  is  also  important  to  consider  different  types  of  infrastructure, 
such  as  the  financial  infrastructure.  At  the  time  that Grameen  Phone  started,  cell  phones  were 
not particularly cheap so they needed a method of financing, which  is where microfinance came 
in.  In  order  to  cater  to  people  living  in  poverty,  it  is  important  to  understand  their  cash  flows. 
Harish  Hande,  founder  of  SELCO  Solar  Company  in  India,  argues  that  every  technology  can 
become  affordable  with  the  right  financing.  He  often  shares  the  story  of  his  interview  with  a 
woman who said that she could not possibly pay the full price of 300 rupees a month for a small 
solar  photovoltaic  system,  but  she  could  pay  10  rupees  a  day.  Harish  Hande  turns  the  notion 
that  solar  energy  is  expensive  for  the  poor  on  its  head,  saying  that  the  rich  are  the  ones  who 
need  subsidies.  A  big  takeaway  here  is  that  if  we  can  get  the  supply  chain  in  place  and make 
the price affordable, our  technology may become more appropriate. While  there  is a  lot of  room 
for  improvement  within  the  appropriate  technology  movement,  there  are  also  many  positive 
lessons that we can retain. 
 
Case Studies: 
Next,  the  class  discussed  some  technologies  from  the  readings,  starting  with  the  PeePoo  bag 
and  the  PlayPump.  Students  started  by  responding  to  a  quick,  informal  survey  about  their 
impressions  of  the  technologies  on  a  scale  from  1  to  5,  with  5  being  an  excellent  idea.  Most 
people  thought  the  PeePoo  was  around  3  and  the  PlayPump  fell  at  about  4.  The  class  then 
discussed what they  liked and did not  like about the technologies, based on the  information that 
they had. 
 
PeePoo: 
Amy  wondered  how  many  classes  at  MIT  get  to  talk  about  something 
called  PeePoo.  Students  seemed  to  have  mixed  feelings  about  the 
technology  overall.  One  person  thought  that  one-time-use  bags  would 
required  a  lot  of  distribution,  upkeep  and  maintenance  cost.  Another 
student  pointed  out  that  if  the  bags  are  being  used  in  slums,  the 
population  tends  to be more dense, potentially making distribution easier. 
Someone  came  back  with  the  argument  that  full-compliance  in  use  is 
important  for  preventing  disease  transmission,  particularly  in  crowded 
areas (in surveys, 85% of people said they would use the PeePoo). When 
Amy  asked  how  many  students  in  the  class  would  use  PeePoo  bags  for 
the  next  week,  only  5  raised  their  hands.  It  is  especially  important  to 
consider  the  cultural  context  and  the  use  of  bags may  not  be  appropriate 
in some communities, especially for the women. In some slums, however, 
people  are  already  defecating  plastic  bags  and  throwing  them  away  as 
“flying  toilets.”  People  may  already  be  used  to  open  defecation  and  less 
self-conscious  about  privacy.  There  are  possibilities  of  finding  situations where  these  bags  can 
be  effective,  but  the  creators  may  not  be  thinking  in  that  way.  Advertising  has  compared  the 
bags  to  having  the  same  impact  and  being  as  revolutionary  as  computers.  One  student  was

frustrated with  the way PeePoo presented  itself  in  the brochure, and how  it kept saying  that  the 
bags  were  affordable  without  ever  mentioning  the  actual  price.  A  few  thought  the  PeePoo’s 
impact  was  better  than  nothing,  and  liked  the  opportunity  for  income  generation  by  selling  the 
waste  as  fertilizer.  Someone  else  was  concerned  that  the  bags  are  made  out  of  petroleum 
products, which may not be sustainable in the long-term. Many students in the class agreed that 
the  PeePoo  may  work  better  as  a  transition  technology,  with  the  eventual  goal  of  putting  in 
latrines and sewer systems.  
 
PlayPump: 
Many  students were amused  that everyone  says  the PlayPump  can make  it  less work  to pump 
water,  since  people  still  have  to  lift  the  same  amount  of  water,  plus  now  there  is  additional 
friction and moment of  inertia  from  the roundabout structure  to  take  into account.  It may be nice 
for  children  to  have  something  new  to  play  on,  but  not  if  they  have  to  “play”  all  day  instead  of 
going  to  school.  If  no  children  are  around,  how  does  the  community  pump  water?  There  have 
been  photos  of  women  having  to  turn  the  heavy  roundabout  by  hand  instead.  One  student 
asked  if  the PlayPump  could be hooked up  to  livestock  instead? Another was  concerned about 
the  high  capital  investment  involved,  particularly  if  the  aquifer  ends  up  running  dry  or  the 
groundwater  ends  up  being  contaminated  like  in  Bangladesh  where  there  is  arsenic.  Amy 
clarified  that  PlayPumps  are  typically  installed  where  hand  pumps  are  already  being  used  with 
existing  naturally-replenishing  aquifers,  so  people  would  have  the  same  source  of  water  for 
better  or  worse.  Maintenance  of  the  PlayPump  is  another  issue,  however,  since  many  of  the 
parts  are  specialized  and  may  have  to  be  shipped  in.  One  person  was  relieved  that  at  least  it 
seems  like  user  error  with  PlayPumps  cannot  really  make  the  situation  worse,  unlike  with  the 
PeePoo  bags.  Someone  else  commented  that  this  technology  appears  very  inefficient  with  so 
much  extra material,  then was  reminded  that  the  image  of  having  cute  children  running  around 
is  attractive  to  donors  and  the  money  is  earned  through  advertising.  PlayPumps  may  be 
considered  hip,  which  is  good  for  design  magazines,  but  do  they  really  work  well  for  the 
communities that have them installed? People who are interested in learning more should watch 
the  following  video  update  called  “Troubled  Water,”  which  shows  the  fate  of  PlayPumps  now:

Below are a  few guiding questions within different dimensions of analysis, which we used  in our 
class discussion. Comments are in italics. 
 
Technology: 
•  Does the technology work? 
o 
If so, does the technology work all the time? 
o 
Is it susceptible to user error? 
(cid:131)  For  example,  the  PeePoo  website  says  that  people  have  to  avoid 
touching certain parts of the bag, which may be hard to do in practice. 
•  Does the technology address the problem? 
o  Sometimes  a  technology  addresses  the  problem  only  partially  for  certain 
situations.  If  this  is  the  case,  what  aspects  of  the  problem  are  addressed  by  the 
technology? What aspects are not addressed? 
•  Can the technology be maintained locally? 
o  The  PeePoo  will  need  the  right  supply  chain  to  be  in  place  for  distribution  and 
collection. People will be more  incentivized  to market  the bags and help maintain 
the system if they can make decent money from doing so. 

Context: 
•  Does using the technology require behavior change? 
o  This  is  one  of  the  most  difficult  barriers  to  address  for  technology  adoption, 
especially  if  the  behavior  change  requires  more  time  or  effort.  People  living  in 
poverty  are  busy  enough  trying  to  survive  and  already  have  high  demands  on 
their  time  and  limited  resources.  Remember  how  Bish  said  that  some  people 

Page 6 of 7 

choose  not  to  look  for  a  job  in  the  morning  so  that  they  will  not  have  to  eat  as 
much  that  day.  If  they  get  a  job,  then  they  can  eat  more  and  work  more,  but 
otherwise  they  have  to  conserve  energy.  There  are many  trade-offs  to  consider. 
Try  to  understand  people’s  rational  decision-making  and  their  framework  for 
doing so. 

Cost: 
• 

Is the technology affordable? 
o  PeePoo  says  it  is  aiming  for  a  cost  of  2-3  cents  a  bag,  but  projections  are  often 
too  optimistic  (take  the  example  of  the  $100  laptop)  so  this  could  actually mean 
3-4  cents  a  bag.  If  we  give  them  the  benefit  of  the  doubt  and  use  a  cost  of  3 
cents  in  our  estimates,  this  comes  out  to  about  $200  a  year  for  a  5-person 
household, which  is actually enough  to build a decent  latrine. Remember  to  look 
at  the  numbers  carefully  because  people  can  publicize  statistics  in  a  way  that 
sounds more attractive. 
o  Let’s try another example. PlayPumps cost about $7,000 each, according to their 
publicity,  although  the  actual  cost  may  be  higher.  Their  average  flow  rate  is 
supposedly  about  400  gallons  per  hour,  which  may  sound  high,  but  it  seems 
much lower if you look at the per minute rate (which is less than a treadle pump’s 
flow  rate).  Say  an  average  person  requires  a  5  liter  bucket  of  water  each  day. 
How many people could a PlayPump support? What will  the cost come out  to be 
per person? 
•  Does the technology have recurring costs? 
•  Does the technology provide income? If so, for whom? 

 
The case studies reminded us to be wary of anecdotal evidence. People tend to be polite, so we 
cannot always assume that they are giving real feedback. Someone being interviewed about the 
PeePoo  is  likely  to  say  nice  things  about  it  if  the  interviewers  are  foreigners  who  came  all  the 
way  to  their  community  to  bring  these  bags. Keeping  this  in mind, we  need  to  be  careful  about 
managing the temptation to hype something up. Not only is it embarrassing if the hype turns out 
to  be  undeserved;  the  real  negative  impact  is  that  it  is  irresponsible  and  can  waste  resources. 
PlayPumps  received  over  $16  million,  which  could  have  gone  to  programs  that  worked.  This 
work  is  hard,  and  there  have  been many  projects  that  got  a  lot  of  hype  but  did  not  quie  deliver 
on  what  was  promised,  such  as  the  LifeStraw.  Let’s  try  to  be  humble  and  true  about  the  way 
that  we  share  the  work  we  are  doing,  instead  of  promoting  an  ethos  of  praising  untested 
technologies. We  can  be  excited  and  say  that  our  design  is  awesome  and  works,  if  it  is  really 
awesome  and  really  works.  Better  yet,  we  can  focus  our  attention  on  working  hard  with  our 
community partners to have a better chance of building awesome projects that work well.
