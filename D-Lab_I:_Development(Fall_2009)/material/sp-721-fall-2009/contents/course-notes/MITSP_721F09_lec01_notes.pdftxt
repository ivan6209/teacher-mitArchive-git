Staff Introductions: 

Amy Smith  is  the  instructor  and  founder  of D-Lab. She majored  in mechanical  engineering 
at MIT as an undergraduate, but felt unsatisfied learning mostly about cars and bombs. After 
graduation,  she  joined  the  Peace  Corps  in  Botswana  for  4  years,  serving  as  a  teacher  and 
beekeeper. Amy realized that she missed design and engineering, however, so she returned 
to MIT  to  study  and  teach  design  for  development. She  believes  that what  underlies  design 
for  the  developing  world  –  simplicity,  reliability,  low-cost,  ease  of  use  –  is  true  of  all  good  
engineering.  Amy  feels  lucky  to  be  teaching  the  class  she  always  wished  she  could  take  
when  she  was  a  student  at  MIT.  In  this  class,  she  will  share  things  she  learned  over  the 
years  and  things  she  wished  she  knew  while  she  was  in  the  Peace  Corps  and  doing  other 
fieldwork. 

Professor Bish Sanyal  joined D-Lab 3 years ago, when he  first heard about Amy  in a New 
York  Times  article.  He  is  from  the  Department  of  Urban  Studies  and  Planning  (DUSP), 
where  the  approach  is  more  theoretical.  DUSP  looks  at  technological  change  on  a  macro  
level,  so  he  appreciates  D-Lab’s  grassroots  approach.  Many 
in 
this 
field  were 
disenfranchised with  theory and how  things were not happening on  the ground, which  led  to 
the  early  movement  for  appropriate  technology.  Bish  grew  up  in  India  and  was  trained  in 
architecture,  eventually  working  for  his  dad  as  a  project  manager  building  bridges  in  Asia. 
When  he  saw  that  construction  workers  were  men,  women  and  even  children  with  volatile  
lives  where  they  sometimes  did  not  receive  pay,  he  lost  interest  in  this  work  and  turned  to  
economic  development,  focusing  on  how  to  provide  jobs,  housing  and  other  necessities. 
Around this time was the Leftist movement in India and a major strike, so  it was a good time 
to go  to graduate school. One of his projects was  in  Zambia, where his  first assignment was

to  figure  out why  people were  not  paying  for  housing  sponsored  by World Bank  loans. Bish 
became  interested  in  urban  planning  and  joined  MIT  as  an  assistant  professor  in  1984, 
eventually  rising  to  department  head  and  chair  of  faculty. Now  he  is  teaching with  Amy  and 
will  be  bringing  a  little  development  theory  to  help  the  class  consider  the  larger  scope  of  
development. 

Victor  Grau  Serrat  is  a  D-Lab  instructor  who  co-teaches  D-Lab:  Development,  D-Lab: 
Design  and  D-Lab:  ICT  (information  and  communication  technologies).  His  undergraduate 
studies  were  in  electrical  engineering  and  computer  science  in  Spain.  Victor  then  came  to 
the  US  for  a  Master’s  degree  at  the  University  of  Maryland,  completing  a  thesis  on  a  very 
theoretical  topic.  He  wanted  to  be  more  hands-on,  so  then  he  went  to  teach  and  live  in  a 
poor  neighborhood  of  the  2nd  largest  city  in  Bolivia.  This  is  where  he  realized  he  could 
combine  his  skills  and  interests  to  work  on  ICTs  for  the  developing  world.  Victor  worked  at 
one  of  his  dream  jobs,  doing  projects  all  over  the  world,  and  is  now  teaching  with  Amy.  He 
has also started his own class on ICTs for development. 

Derek Brine is the Teaching Assistant and resident environmental engineer. He has worked 
in Kenya, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania, and China. He will be  leading an IAP trip and will be  in 
charge of grades. 

Dennis  Nagle  is  the  D-Lab  workshop  manager.  He  teaches  appropriate  tools  for 
appropriate technology, such as how to use a hammer, chisel and hacksaw. 

Nate & Jess are the newest members of the D-Lab staff. Nate studied product design at the 
Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, while Jess studied civil engineering and business 
at  the University  of California, Berkeley. They will  be  taking  notes  in  class  for Open Course 
Ware and leading IAP trips in January. 

Paula Cogliano is the course administrator. 

History of D-Lab: 
The  program  started  in  2002 with  only  10  students.  The  first  class,  called  The Haiti Class,  was 
(not surprisingly) focused on Haiti and  taught  in collaboration with  the Haitian Students A lliance, 
who  wanted  to  work  on  projects  in  their  home  country  but  involve more  of  the MIT  community. 
Prior  to  The  Haiti  Class,  Amy  had  been  teaching  on  Designs 
for Developing Countries, but without a particular geographical 
focus.  The  next  year,  students  from  India  and  Brazil  became 
interested  in  being  part  of  the  class,  but  they  couldn’t  call  it 
The Haiti-India-Brazil Class, so they came up with the name of 
D-Lab. There happen  to be many words starting with  the  letter 
“d”  that  reflect  the spirit of our program, such as development, 
design,  dissemination,  dialogue,  and  discovery.  D-Lab  has 
since  grown  to  reaching  over  200  students  a  year  and 
deploying  projects  in  over  20  countries.  By  the  2010-11 
academic  year,  D-Lab  will  have  a  suite  of  over  12  class 
offerings. 

Since  the  class  is  oversubscribed,  students  that  do  not  make  it  into  this  class  by  lottery  may 
consider  taking  another  class  in  the  D-Lab  family  being  offered  this  fall,  such  as  Development 
Ventures, D-Lab:  ICT,  or D-Lab: Cycle  Ventures.  There  are  another  6 D-Lab  classes  offered  in 
the  spring  (D-Lab:  Design,  D-Lab:  Dissemination,  D-Lab:  Health,  D-Lab:  Energy,  Wheelchair 
Design for Developing Countries, and Developing World Prosthetics).

Course Overview: 
This  course  aims  to  build  awareness  of  development  issues  and  appropriate  technologies, 
developing  both  hands-on  skills  and  theoretical  background.  A  unique  part  of  the  course  is  an 
optional  fieldwork  trip  over  the  January  IAP  session,  where  students  have  an  opportunity  to 
work  on  a  variety  of  projects,  learn  from  rural  communities  firsthand  and  engage  in  cultural 
sharing. 

The  class will  consist  of  lectures,  guest  speakers  (including William  Kamkwamba,  a  self-taught 
windmill maker from Malawi, and world experts in a variety of fields), hands-on activities and  lab 
sessions  (such  as  using  agricultural  processing  equipment,  testing  water  for  contaminants  and 
building  a  concrete  latrine  slab),  team  projects,  and  area  studies  to  prepare  for  the  trips. Class 
topics, ranging  from energy  to microfinance, will be divided  into short modules, with dual foci on 
theory and practical solutions. 

D-Lab  has  a  strong  emphasis  on  experiential  learning.  Students  will  be  building  skills  that 
enable  them  to  do  something  practical  and  enact  real  change  over  the  IAP  trip,  like  building  a 
water  treatment  system  for  a  community.  Amy  jokes  that  if  anyone  dislikes  working  with 
charcoal,  he  or  she  should  think  about  dropping  the  class  as D-Lab  does  a  lot work  on making 
charcoal out of agricultural waste. 

Projects  do  not  all  require  engineering,  and  often  involve 
work  in  education,  health  and  nutrition,  microenterprise, 
and other fields. Students will be  forming country teams  in 
a  few  weeks  and  will  choose  projects  with  their  team  and 
community  partners.  The  team  may  choose  to  focus  on  
one  project  or  split  up  to  work  on  multiple  projects.  Each 
student will  bring  their  own  expertise,  but  everyone  needs 
to  be  careful  not  to  force  their  interest  if  it  has  no 
application  to  the  partner  community.  Most  importantly,  
students  are  encouraged  to  be  personally  engaged. Many 
students  will  bring  their  own  passion  and  do  projects 
based on personal interest, in addition to class projects. 

Q: Does D-Lab go back to the same work sites every year? 
A: D-Lab  does  often  return  to  the  same  community  site  but with  evolved  projects. Students 
may  continue  working  on  their  project  through  another  D-Lab  class  or  a  fellowship  to  work 
with  the  community  partner  over  the  summer.  Often  the  community  partners  learn  more 
about  what  D-Lab  is  capable  of  and  will  ask  for  assistance  with  different  projects.  For 
example,  Victor  worked  with  an  organization  in  Honduras  that  was  mostly  focused  on  
building  techniques, but they wanted  to  learn more about biogas so  they requested  that MIT 
students help with the research for a pilot. 

Examples of D-Lab Projects: 
Perhaps  one  of  the  most  successful  examples  is  a  pedal  power  project  that  has  grown  into  a 
viable  company, Global Cycle Solutions  (GCS). GCS was  founded by D-Lab  student Jodie Wu, 
who  took  several  classes  from  the  D-Lab  family  suite  of  classes  and  developed  a  pedal-
powered  maize  sheller  and  grinder.  Jodie  was  introduced  to  D-Lab  through  the  Wheelchair 
Design  for Developing Countries.  In  January  2008,  after  being  inspired  by Maya Pedal’s  pedal-
powered  technologies  in  Guatemala,  she  traveled  to  Tanzania  as  part  of  D-Lab:  Development 
with  a  vision  to  bring  adapted  pedal-power  technologies  to  communities  that  could  use  them. 
She expected wide  impact with  these devices, but upon  reaching  the  field, she  realized  that  the  
stationary  technology she brought was designed  for another context and she needed  to make  it 

Page 3 of 4 

more affordable and portable  in order to reach the rural communities who needed  it most.  Jodie 
wanted  to  make  a  pedal-powered  sheller  that  was  accessible  to  the  many  villagers  who  were 
still  shelling maize  by  hand,  a  process  that  typically  takes  weeks,  pulling  children  out  of  school 
as  food  for  the  family  often  takes precedence over education. 

In  response  to  these  challenges,  in  spring  2008,  Jodie 
worked on a  team  in D-Lab: Design  to develop  a modified 
maize  sheller  peripheral  that  attaches  to  a  bicycle  without 
altering  its  functionality.  That  summer,  Jodie  traveled  to  
farms  and  villages  in  Arusha,  Tanzania  and  watched  as 
implementation  of  a  simple  yet  valuable 
this  novel 
technology  became  a  powerful 
income  generation 
opportunity  for  the  entrepreneur,  earning  positive  returns 
within  one  week.  The  device  not  only  shelled  maize  40  
times faster than by hand, but it also brought an affordable 
service  that  saved  rural  villagers  from  arduous  manual  
labor.  A 
formerly  unaffordable device became an opportunity  for enterprise.  Jodie worked  
with  teams  in D-Lab: Dissemination  and  Development Ventures  to  develop  the  business model  
for Global  Cycle  Solutions,  a  company  that  would  produce  and  sell  the  pedal-powered  devices 
to get them into the hands of as many users as possible. 

Today,  GCS  is  continuing  to  develop  its  universal  adapter  and  bicycle  peripheral  devices,  and  
creating  a  sustainable  business  model  to  disseminate  their  family  of  technologies  to  rural 
communities  all  over  the  world.  GCS  has  since  won  several  competitions,  including  the 
Development Track and Audience Choice Award at  the MIT $100K Business Plan Competition, 
and  successfully  fundraised  over  $200,000  for  their  operations.  Jodie  has  deferred  a  full 
scholarship to graduate school at Berkeley to launch GCS in Tanzania. 

World Facts Quiz: 
This  in-class  exercise  is  an  interactive  introduction  to  international  development.  Students  are 
usually  shocked  to  find  out  the  statistics  representing  conditions  today. 

At  the  end  of  class,  interested  students  can  fill  in  application  forms  to  enter  the  class  lottery  
system. The MIT Service Fair  is taking place  immediately afterward from 5-6:30pm in Lobby 13, 
where students will be able to explore additional local and international service opportunities.
