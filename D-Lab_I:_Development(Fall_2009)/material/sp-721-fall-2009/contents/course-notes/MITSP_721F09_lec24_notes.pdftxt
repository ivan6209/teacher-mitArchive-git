Iqbal  Quadir  is  the  founder  and  director  of  the  Legatum  Center  for  Development  and 
Entrepreneurship  at  MIT,  which  promotes  bottom-up  entrepreneurship  in  developing  countries. 
He  is  often  credited  as  having  been  the  earliest  observer  of  the  potential  for mobile  phones  to 
transform  low-income  countries.  Iqbal  spent  most  of  the  1990s  founding  and  building 
GrameenPhone Ltd., which has now become Bangladesh’s largest telephone company, with net 
income  of  $250  million  in  2006.  To  date,  it  has  built  the  largest  cellular  network  in  the  country 
with a subscriber base of nearly 20 million, providing telephone access to more than 100 million 
people, while helping  to  create 250,000 micro-entrepreneurs  in  these  villages. Previously,  Iqbal 
taught  at  the  John  F.  Kennedy  School  of  Government  at  Harvard  University,  focusing  on  the 
impact of technologies in the politics and economics of developing countries. 

For this class, Iqbal will first give a brief introduction to the programs he  leads and then open up 
the  session  for  discussion  through  a  question  and  answer  format.  Grameen  Phone  is  a  cell 
phone  company  in  Bangladesh  with  20  million  subscribers  that  provides  coverage  across  the 
country and offers people income-generating possibilities by providing cell phone access to their 
neighbors.  It  has  since  grown  to  over  100  million  people  and  has  been  replicated  in  several 
countries.  The  Legatum  Center  is  supported  by  a  billionaire  from  New  Zealand  that  gave  $50 
million  to  MIT,  funding  programs  such  as  seed  grants  and  fellowships  to  support  graduate 
students in creating enterprises in developing countries. These opportunities may be opened up 
to  undergraduate  students  in  future  years.  Derek,  the  class  T.A.,  was  part  of  the  first  class  of 
Legatum Fellows. 

Q: How do you transfer enterprises from MIT students to other countries? 
A:  We  do  not  transfer  them.  Students  are  supported  to  create  enterprises  in  other  countries. 
There  is  no  need  for  transferring.  It  happens  in  those  countries  –  the  students  learn  there  and 
create  their  enterprises  there.  MIT  admits  students  from  all  over  the  world,  in  hopes  that  they

will  go  create  enterprises  in  their  home  country.  Additionally,  the  “average  American”  is  very 
diverse and could also be from anywhere, and could go anywhere to create an enterprise. 

Q: How does long-term sustainability work? 
A: We promote for-profit enterprises. If something makes a profit,  it  is sustainable. In fact,  it can 
grow  with  the  profit.  If  you  cannot  make  something  sustainable,  that  means  you  have  not 
thought hard enough. We should be more creative here. 

If  you  are  someone  from  Kenya  and  you  create  an  enterprise,  you  have  created  something 
useful  to  the  population  as  well  as  doing  economically  well  for  yourself.  You  have  also  set  an 
example because all of this can be an  incentive  for others to do  the same. Bill Gates must have 
inspired thousands of young people. Similarly, if you can inspire others, that is a big impact. 

The Legatum Center does not push people to have an enterprise as soon as you graduate MIT. 
We  are  somewhat  realistic.  This  year  there  are  16  fellows,  but  there were  only  3  fellows  in  the 
inaugural class. One of  those  fellows has since created an enterprise  to  import gluten-free  food 
from  Latin  America  and  sell  it  in  Europe  and  the  US.  Another  is  trying  to  create  recycled 
electronic  products  in  Pakistan,  such  as  recycled  cell  phones.  Derek  is  trying  to  create  a 
company  that  processes  leaves  of Moringa  oleifera,  a  natural multivitamin  plant  that  has major 
nutritional benefits if introduced into children’s food. All of these initiatives can also be profitable. 

If  you  look  at  the  history  of  progress,  it  is  the  history  of  the  distribution  of  power.  Corruption 
comes  from  concentration  of  power.  Innovations  help  to  disperse  power.  In  his  classes  at 
Harvard,  Iqbal  tries  to  give  historical  examples  of  why  it  is  better  to  innovate  to  support 
democratic  processes  and  economic  growth.  If  you  look  at  the  history  of  property  rights  and 
checks  and  balances  in  the  British  Parliament,  it  was  the  shortage  of  money  that  led  to  the 
ruling  party  to  make  compromises  and  disperse  power,  giving  rise  to  political  and  economic 
progress.  In  developed  countries,  we  tend  to  support  entrepreneurs,  bringing  innovations  and 
profits  to  help  our  country  become  prosperous  and  democratic.  In  contrast,  we  have  tried  and 
failed  to  support  poorer  countries  by  mostly  providing  government  aid  and  charity.  It  is  a  myth 
that poor people do not also need pocketbooks, finances and ways to save. 

Q: What is the government’s main role in international development? 
A: My  view  is  that government’s main  role  is governing and  regulations. When  the government 
tries  to  get  into  other  businesses  and  industries,  it  can  distract  itself.  I  am  for  government  but  I 
think  the  question  is  not  what  is  the  role  of  government,  but  how  to  create  good  governments. 
When  the government  is good,  it will do good  things. Likewise, when a government  is corrupt,  it 
will  do  bad  things  and  the  whole  political  process  becomes  corrupted.  We  need  forces  that 
counter  the  garnering  of  too  much  power.  You  need  newspapers  and  other  media  so  people 
have  the  courage  to  speak  out  if  the  government  does  something  wrong.  I  am  not  actually  for 
the  private  sector,  but  you  need  the  private  sector. You  cannot  have  one  private  company  and 
one  government  making  all  the  decisions.  There  is  a  good  book  about  this  by  Professor 
Yasheng  Huang  from  Sloan.  The  topic  is  also  covered  in  the  book  by  Jeffrey  Sachs,  who  is  a 
proponent of government led development.

Q: What  are  the  checks  for  private  enterprise  dispersal?  For  example, what  if Derek  had 
tried to patent his Moringa leaves and sell it at a high profit that excludes the people who 
need it most? 
A: There are  too many other problems on  the ground  to worry about before  this. People do not 
even  have  basic,  fundamental  rights.  They  might  not  have  property  rights,  so  how  can  they 
worry  about  intellectual  rights  right  now?  Even  some  digital  technologies  that  emerged  from 
Western  countries,  such  as  Microsoft  and  Hollywood,  have  difficulties  protecting  patents  and 
copyrights in developing countries. Before other important needs, we have become preoccupied 
with IP rights. It used to be that people in England invented things and Americans stole them for 
industry.  Even  if  there  is  government  protection  of  IP,  people  may  not  feel  that  it  is  important 
and may  ignore  them.  Bottom-up  development  is  necessary  so  people  feel  the  need  to  protect 
what  they  have  invented.  Right  now,  people  only  feel  that  IP  is  only  one-way.  This  is  why 
software is pirated. People tend to charge an exorbitant price. Iqbal advises charging more from 
early adopters and less from mature/slow adopters. 

Q: If you are creating your own enterprise, when do you consider going to a larger scale? 
A: At MIT, we  are  attracted  to  thinking  big  things  because we  pay  a  lot  to  be  here  and  there  is 
an  opportunity  cost.  If  you  want  to  develop  a  small  enterprise,  however,  no  one  can  stop  you. 
You  can  also  create  a  large  organization  that  supports  a  lot  of  small  enterprises.  For  example, 
Grameen  Phone  supports  the  micro  enterprises  of  local  women.  If  you  have  a  standardized 
product that thousands of villages can use, you can think about creating a  larger organization to 
support  spreading  this  to  other  areas.  You  can  start  by  developing  a  microenterprise. 
Depending  on  your  contentment  level,  it  is  better  to  start  small  unless  you  will  only  be  content 
doing something big. It is easier to manage and learn from something smaller. 

Q:  An  issue  in  developing  countries  is  scale  of  capital.  What  do  you  recommend  going 
through in order to deal with this limitation: a social enterprise, government, or NGO? 
A:  I  am  not  so  worried  about  scale.  The  important  thing  is  if  you  create  something  of  value.  If 
you  do  something  amazing  and  start  with  2  cows,  what  is  preventing  you  from  taking  that  to 
other  households  and  villages?  If  Bangladeshi  citizens  held  government  bonds  instead  of 
receiving  money  from  foreign  entities,  thousands  would  demand  that  the  government  become 
accountable.  Bangladesh  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  but  is  growing  at  6%  this  year.  If  the 
aid money  is only dispersed  in small amounts,  it may not make a huge  impact, since foreign aid 
is  often  only  1%  or  less.  If  it  is  given  in  a  chunk  to  the  government,  however,  it  could  change 
their priorities. 

Q:  You  are  saying  development  should  be  handled  by  private  enterprise  and  NGOs  as 
necessary. The government  is  responsible  for  law and order. How can  they maintain  law 
and order? 
A:  The  government  needs  enough  tax  funds  to  be  able  to maintain  law  and  order.  It  is  easy  to 
identify which countries desperately need money  to support  law and order, and which countries 

Page 3 of 4 

are  siphoning  off money  to  support businesses  for  their  own  gain.  In  the  latter  case,  refuse  the 
government aid and make them shut down the businesses. 

Q: Why do you think democracy is not functioning well in certain countries? 
A: Even  if we establish  the  right  to  vote, who protects  the  right? Government  should protect us 
from  enemies,  criminals,  diseases  and  other  threats.  Its  job  is  supposed  to  be  protection.  In 
many countries, governments are not in the business of protection; they are running businesses 
instead. Citizens  in  this case have  too  little power  to demand government protection. The  rights 
do not exist because people are not demanding  them and there  is no one to protect them. Take 
Bangladesh  for  example,  where  there  is  a  shortage  of  schools,  hospitals,  roads  and  other 
infrastructure.  The  Bangladeshi  government  still  went  into  the  cell  phone  business  when  there 
were  already  6  existing  cell  phones  companies  because  it  is  an  attractive  business.  If  you  look 
at  the ground  in  real situations, government priorities are not always what  they are supposed  to 
be.  If  Bangladesh  found  mineral  oil  wealth,  they  would  be  finished.  The  government  would  no 
longer  rely on  taxes and selling bonds  from  its citizens, and  there would no  longer be any need 
for them to be accountable. 

The  interesting  thing  is  that  capitalism  gives  rise  to  democracy.  Individual  grassroots  initiatives 
can  be  powerful  and  working  through  NGOs  can  be  more  effective  than  going  through 
government. This  is how  the Grameen Phone started. When  the China government  intervened, 
it actually made certain things more difficult. It is all a cycle. Iqbal believes this is a critical point. 

We  have  to  support  liberating  ideas.  There  are  two  ways  to  support  development:  1)  we  can 
switch  out  of  aid  and  2)  we  can  support  entrepreneurs.  Stopping  aid  is  like  getting  rid  of  the 
headwind, and supporting entrepreneurs is like growing the tailwind.
