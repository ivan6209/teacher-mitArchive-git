•  History of Development (1950-1970): The Colonial Legacy 
•  Follow-Up Discussion on Stakeholder Analysis 

History of Development: 
Today, Bish  is  leading  the class  in a discussion of  the early history of development. So how did 
we  get  here  to  the  current  state  of  things?  Much  is  the  result  of  colonialism,  as  the  colonial  
legacy  left many regions very  fragmented. Most countries 
had  only  a  few  big  port  cities,  unequal  land  ownership 
and  distributional  issues.  There  was  no  technology 
transfer;  the  focus was on  the  extraction  of  raw materials 
from  former  colonies  for  export.  For  the  most  part, 
administration  was  centralized  and  local  governments 
were  regulated.  There  were  no  elections  except  at  the 
local  level,  but  even  local  elections  were  not  about  
preference  and  representation.  Decentralization  and 
giving  power  to  the  locals  was  not  popular,  since  there  
was  an  internalized  notion  of  inferiority  among  poor 
people. 

In 1951, Arthur Lewis wrote about a model of economic development with unlimited labor supply 
and was a champion of  free migration.  In  this model, you exploit  inequality at  the beginning and  
use  that as momentum  for growth. For example,  income distribution will be more skewed at  the 
start, but is supposed to equalize a little over time. Types of inequality include sectoral inequality 
(the  industrial  sector  vs.  the  agricultural  sector),  spacial  inequality  (rural  vs.  urban  areas),  and 
social  inequality (local vs. foreign). Urban-rural  inequalities would mean  that  the  rate of return  in 
the  industrial  sector  is  higher  than  in  the  agricultural  sector,  but  rural  and  urban  wages  should 
eventually  equalize  as  people  move  from  rural  to  urban  areas.  There  is  a  famous  “U”  curve 
demonstrating 
this,  where 
the 
inequality 
index 
increases  and 
then  improves  during 
development.  Lewis’  model  relies  on  strong  national  planning  and  yet  there  is  no  political  
consideration  in  his  writings.  These  ideas  are  representative  of  the  early  model  of  economic  
development, which focused on industrialization, urbanization and agricultural modernization. 

Rostow 
strategies  of 
that 
theorized 
from  MIT 
industrialization  should  involve  substituting  imports  and 
promoting  exports,  and 
training  a  new  cadre  of 
technocrats.  Technology  can  increase  productivity,  which 
raises  consumption.  The  goal  is  to  substitute  imports,  
which is what colonial powers used for control, as colonies 
received  foreign  imports  instead  of  getting  access  to  
technologies.  Producing  your  own  technologies  helps  to 
build  up  your  country,  enabling  you  to  compete  in  
international  markets.  Technology 
in 
this  model  of 
development  traditionally  refers  to  technological  change 
for production and manufacturing. 

In India in 1990, growth actually came with an increase in inequality because most of the growth 
was  happening  in  the  technology  sector, which  benefited mostly  the middle  and  upper  classes.

An  example  of  this  association  between  the  elite  class  and  technological  change  is  the 
emergence  of  the  Indian  Institutes  of  Technologies  (IIT),  which  subsidized  the  training  of  
technocrats.  India’s  strategy  has  been  to  take  the  elite,  train  them  in  the  IIT  system  and  then  
have  this  new  cadre  of  technocrats  build  up  the  country.  What  about  the  rural  areas?  The  
mindset  has  mostly  been  about  catching  up,  so  there  tends  to  be  more  focus  on  urbanization 
and supporting an elite class that can compete. One result of this has been cheap labor. 

Governments often come  into productive processes so  they can compete  in  industries  that  they 
were absent in earlier. Historically, there has also been distrust of private industries. Some have 
perceived private firms to be like greedy colonialists, who come  in  to extract resources and  then 
leave.  It  is  important  to  remind  ourselves  of  why  the  public  sector  prefers  to  hold  commanding 
rights and there has been such a distrust of the private sector. 

There  are  different  elements  of  modernization:  economic  modernization  (capitalism),  political 
modernization  (democracy),  and  social  modernization.  Political  modernization  meant  moving 
from  tribalism  to  nationalism.  For  example,  in  India,  people  in  support  of modernization  did  not 
used  to  respect  tribalism.  There  was  an  opinion  that  tribalism  was  old  and  superstitious,  and 
that  tribes  split  the  nation  into  fractions.  People  wanted  to  build  the  nation  as  a  whole.  Today, 
people want to respect indigenous ways and bring them back, but it was not so in the beginning. 

There  is  a  relationship  between  political  modernization 
and  economic  modernization.  An  illustration  of  this  is 
how  Americans,  who  had  a  big  role  in  foreign  aid, 
believed  that  democracy  and  capitalism  went  hand  in 
hand.  This  was  especially  evident  during  the  Cold  War, 
yet  Fascist  Spain  and  other  countries  were  still  growing 
without  democracy.  The  US  thought  that  a  democratic 
political  system  was  necessary  to  representation,  but 
now  people  are  realizing  that  it  can  be  a  hindrance  to 
representation, 
favoring  certain  communities  and 
interest  groups  instead.  There  was  a  belief  that  people 
would  form  new  political  parties  based  on  interests, 
rather than allegiances of the old kind, when they moved into the cities. When you go to the field 
in January, ask yourself: 
•	 Who are the political leaders? What are they planning to do? 
•	 Pretend you need to get sugar and some interests control the sugar. Who would you talk 
to  –  the  politicians  or  the  community  leaders?  Remember  that  politicians  still  have  a  lot  
of influence. 
•	 There  is a  trend of decreasing organized  labor.  In  the US,  for example,  fewer and  fewer 
laborers  are  becoming  unionized.  You  will  see  this  in  other  countries  as  well,  since  as 
much  as  70%  of  the  workforce  can  be  in  the  informal  labor  sector.  If  workers  are  not  
organized,  who  is  representing  them?  People  are  now  starting  to  be  organized  through 
community groups. See who is playing that role. 

In  the  social  sphere,  there  has  been  a  movement  toward  rationality.  One  meaning  of  being 
rational is to use time wisely and make the most of it. England started putting up clocks in public 
places to remind people that time is not unlimited. They structured the labor force based on time 
and  believed  that  discipline  would  make  the  labor  force  more  productive.  Another  aspect  of  
rationality  is to reduce the labor required. Labor-saving tools, such as the handheld corn sheller, 
can  be  considered  rational:  for  $2  you  can  shell  corn  in  much  less  time  and  use  that  time  for 
something else.

What  is  the  right  use  of  our  time?  The  thinking  has  been 
to reduce the time required for certain tedious tasks so we 
can  spend  more  time  on  worthwhile  activities,  such  as 
education.  Yet  sometimes  what  we  think  is  irrational  is 
actually  very  rational,  such  as  seeing  someone  resting  in 
the  afternoon  instead  of  looking  for  a  job.  It  can  be  hard  
for  us  to  empathize  because  we  do  not  understand  their 
situation  and  how  their  resources  are  constrained,  but 
people  may  have  so  few  resources  that  they  cannot 
adequately  feed  their  body,  so  they  rest when  there  is  no 
work  to  conserve  energy  and  preserve  their  body  as  long 
as  they  can.  These  are  actually  very  detailed  calculations. We  should  not  be  arrogant  in  telling  
people how  to be rational, but we should also not be glorifying poverty and not trying  to  improve 
situations when we can. The  important thing  is  to work  together with  the people we are  trying  to 
help, as most already know a lot about how to best use their resources. 

Part of our western concept of rationality  is  this  idea  that the  individual  is at the center. We tend 
to greatly value independence, yet we see people moving back in with their mothers when times 
get  tough.  Why?  Don’t  we  want  to  move  out  and  become  independent  when  we’re  16? 
Remember that social network is a big part of support, and it is what people fall back upon when 
things  are  not  going  well.  This  is  especially  important  for  poor  people  who  are  especially 
vulnerable.  You  give  me  salt  today  and  I’ll  give  you  sugar  tomorrow.  Many  poor  communities  
are tight-knit and people tend to stay together. 

A  key  assumption  has  been  that  a  lower  level  technologies  means  the  quality  of  life  will  be  
inferior.  Another  assumption  has  been  that  leapfrogging  is  always  the  best  option.  If  people 
have developed better ways of doing things, why not just use those? Do not go capital  intensive 
if  you  do  not  have  to  reinvent  the  wheel.  One  example  is  adopting  mobile  phones  instead  of 
building  up  a  comprehensive  landline  infrastructure.  Leapfrogging  is  about  catching  up  and  
going  for  a  level  of  technology  that  is  much  higher  than  what  you  have  right  now,  but  what 
happens  when  you  give  people  a  level  of  technology  that  they  are  not  familiar  with  using? 
Remember that higher levels of technology can sometimes require more education to utilize. 

An  important  consideration  is  scale,  because  many  projects  that  we  are  working  on  are  of  a  
smaller scale. Why did people go with such big scales before? Largeness leads to economies of 
scale,  where  you  can  use  fewer  additional  resources  to  produce  more.  There  are  also  
advantages  of  being  small  –  fewer  costs,  etc.  The  question  doesn’t  have  to  be  framed  as  only  
going  either  big  scale  or  small  scale,  as  there  is  a  broad  spectrum,  but  the  argument  about 
scale may haunt you as you go about your projects. Try not  to get  lost  in  the maze of questions  
about bureaucracy and management. 

There  are  also  linkages  and  spillover  effects.  When  we  do  something,  it  often  has  additional 
benefits  (positive  externalities)  and  costs  (negative  externalities).  For  example,  increasing 
production  beyond  a  certain  level  could  over-exhaust  the  ground,  which  reduces  productivity. 
Sustainability brings about a new  rationality  that  reminds people  to not extract  resources now  in 
a way  that  destroys  that  resource  later. We often  use  the  need  to  reduce  negative  externalities 
as  a  justification  for  the  government  to  come  in. Not all big  things are  bad, and many  can  have 
important  benefits,  but  they  can  also  have  bad  side  effects  on  a  large  scale.  Some  of  these 
effects may be  so  large  that  they  are  hard  to monitor  and  control,  but  it  is  crucially  important  to  
continue  trying  to  do  so.  It  is  easy  to  forget  that we  often  need  10-20  years  to  begin  to  see  the 
danger  of  what  can  actually  happen,  especially  when  we  bring  in  technologies  that  we  do  not 
really understand and that may increase the risk of hurting people.

Students  in  the  class  asked  how  to  keep  companies  accountable  when  they  are  so  influential 
and make  such  large plans. For example,  important  factories have gotten away with not paying 
attention  to  safety  standards  and  people  in  the  surrounding  area  may  still  be  affected  by 
negative  health  and  environmental  impacts  for  generations  after.  We  need  more  people  who  
understand  these  issues  and  can  scrutinize  plans  to  come  up  with  better  security  and  back-up 
measures. Come up  to Bish after class  if  you  would  like  to  have  a more  upbeat discussion  and 
talk about some concrete ways  to address  this.  In  this course,  in addition  to  trying  to assess  the 
risks of  technologies, we will also ask whether we need  to have  the newest  technology.  Is  there 
a  more  indigenous  solution  that  is  less  risky?  What  about  small-scale  alternative  energy 
generation instead of macro-level dams for hydropower? 

Follow-up Discussion on Stakeholder Analysis: 
Let’s  share  what  worked  well  and  didn’t  work  well  during  the  roleplay  activity  last  time. We  will 
also go over some  tools and practices  that we can build upon, since none of us have 50+ years 
of experience  in development work. There may be effects  that are  inherent  to  the way we work, 
but we can use tools for participation to help prevent us from making more mistakes. 

What we want  to  do  in  stakeholder  analysis  is  figure  out  who  is  important  to  and  has  influence  
over  a  project.  This  involves  identifying  the  stakeholders,  understanding  their  interests  and 
coming up with  the mechanisms  for moving  forward. Stakeholders can be  individuals, groups or 
institutions  and  are  people  who  are  affected  by  the  intervention.  This  includes  not  just  the  
beneficiaries,  but  also  people  who  are  not  necessarily  positively  affected  or  even  directly 
affected,  such  as  competitors  and  those  unintentionally  impacted  by  side  effects.  During  the 
stakeholder  identification  process,  try  to  be  sure  to  include  groups  that  may  be  especially 
vulnerable  or marginalized  and  are  typically  not  included.  It  is  important  to  remember  that all of 
these  stakeholders  can  have  an  effect  on  the  success  or  failure  of  the  project,  whether  we  are 
talking about the government, local NGOs, or small communities. 

The second step is to assess the stakeholders’ interests and potential impact on the project. Try 
to understand  the ecosystem of stakeholders and each stakeholder’s expectations. People may 
believe that our project has much  larger impacts or different impacts than  it really has. What are 
the  negative  effects  that  people  are  concerned  about?  There  is  room  to  think  creatively  here,  
such as trying to engage competitors and bring them into the project so they still benefit in some 
way.  It  is  important  to  recognize  which  stakeholders  support  our  intervention  and  which  ones 
are  against  it,  and  how  they  could  impact  the  outcomes  of  the  project.  It  helps  to  consider  the 
level  of  status  and  influence  that  the  stakeholders  have,  and  their  level  of  organization. Where 
are  the  most  powerful  stakeholders  located  in  the  network  of  people  affected  by  the  project? 
What is their control over strategic resources? Remember that importance and  influence may or 
may  not  be  in  the  same  dimension.  For  example,  imagine  an  educational  project  where  the 
students  are  incredibly  important  to  the  project  but  rarely  have  influence  over  it.  Should  we  be 
involving the students more in the design of the project? 

Following  this,  we  need  to  outline  strategies  for  participation.  There  are  many  types  of  
participation  to  engage  different  stakeholders,  from  one way  flow  of  information,  to  consultation 
where  people  work  together,  to  collaboration  where  decisions  are  actually  made  together,  to  
empowerment  where  the  people  affected  make  all  the  decisions  rather  than  the  people  who 
started the project, and so forth. Try to think about when this participation occurs in the process. 
Is  it during  the project  identification stage, design,  implementation or evaluation – or  throughout  
the entire process? 

There will always be contingencies, but  this proactive analysis can help us  to  be more aware of  
the  situation.  Remember  that  the  situation  will  evolve,  but  it  is  important  that  we  at  least  think 

Page 4 of 5 

through  this  analysis  so  that  we  can  be  better  prepared.  For  homework,  students  will  be  doing  
the stakeholder analysis assignment for the wheelchair roleplay.
