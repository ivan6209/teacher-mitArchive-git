Mitch  Resnick  directs  the  Lifelong  Kindergarten  group  at  the  MIT 
Media  Lab  and  is  the  LEGO  Professor  of  Learning  Research.  He  
works on  technologies  to engage people, particularly  children and  
youth,  in  creative  learning  experiences.  Mitch’s  research  group 
developed  the  “programmable  brick”  technology  that  insipired  the 
LEGO  MindStorms  robotics  kit.  He  co-founded  the  Computer 
Clubhouse  project,  a  worldwide  network  of  after-school  centers 
where  youth  from  low-income  communities  learn  to  express 
themselves  creatively  with  new  technologies.  Recently,  Mitch’s 
group  developed  Scratch,  an  online  community  where  children 
program  and  share  interactive  stories,  games,  and  animations.  In 
addition  to  being  a  professor  of  MIT,  Mitch  has  worked  as  a 
science-technology  journalist  and  consulted  throughout  the  world 
on creative uses of computers  in education. Mitch spoke earlier  in  
the  semester  and  his  biography  is  repeated  here  for  convenient  reference.  He  will  be  giving  a 
lecture today on ICT (information and communication technologies) in creativity. 

“We want an economy that’s fueled by what we invent and what we build. We’re going 
back to Thomas Edison’s principles. We’re going to build stuff and invent stuff.” 
– P r e s i d e n t   B a r a c k  O b a m a  

How  can  we  help  people  become  risk-takers,  doers,  and  makers  of  things?  Obama  has 
stressed  that  we  live  in  a  society  where  it  is  important  for  people  to  be  creating,  building  and  
inventing, no matter what part of  the world we are  in. Unfortunately,  if you  look at  the education 
system,  it  does  not  tend  to  encourage  people  to  become makers  of  things. Why  has  education  
not  embraced  this  yet?  The  model  of  education  today  is  much  like  the  model  of  development 
today, where people are given  information. We have a chance  to move away  from  the model of  
the  information  society  and  the  knowledge  society,  and  into  the  creative  society.  Knowledge  is 
important, but  just having  the  knowledge  isn’t good enough. How  can we use  technology  to not 
just distribute information, but help people become creative citizens? 

ICT  currently  stands  for  information  &  communication  technologies,  but maybe  we  need  a  new 
type  of  ICT:  innovation  &  creativity  technologies.  Kids  in  kindergarten  are  always  creating 
things,  such  as  making  towers  out  of  wooden  blocks  and  or  making  pictures  out  of  finger

painting.  How  can  we  use  technology  in  this  same  spirit?  It  is  fine  to  have  kids making  robots,  
but how can we support them in making something that is more meaningful and useful to them? 

The class was shown a video of students  from a workshop  that Mitch  ran.  In  the workshop, one  
girl  made  a  house  for  her  pet  gerbil  with  an  automatic  door.  She  really  cared  and  wanted  to 
know  what  her  gerbil  did  at  night,  so  she  even  recorded  data  on  how  often  the  door  was 
opened.  Another  girl  loves  rollerblading  and  wanted  to  know  how  fast  she  went,  so  she  put  a 
sensor  on  the wheels  to  record  how many  revolutions  per  second  and  converted  it  to miles per 
hour. She  did math  that  she wouldn’t  have  done  at  school  because  she was motivated  to  learn 
and figure out something she was curious about. 

The  Lifelong  Kindergarten  group  that  Mitch  leads  has  created  a  YouTube-like  website  called 
Scratch,  for  children  to  upload  projects  to  express  themselves  creatively.  To  date,  nearly 
600,000  videos  have  been  uploaded.  The  class  watches  a  Scratch  project  done  by  a  13-year -
old  in  Bangalore.  It  is  about  the  layers  of  the  Earth  and  has  basic  animation  as  well  as  sound  
effects. The narrative is done in his local language. Scratch provides basic tools, such as sound, 
images and animation, for youth to snap together like building bricks as they create their project. 

Another  video  of  a  Scratch  project  was  played,  this  time  featuring  the  work  of  a  girl  with  the 
username MyRedNeptune. Most  sites  for  sending  electronic  cards  only  allow  people  to  choose 
from existing designs. MyRedNeptune decided to make her own interactive holiday musical card 
that  she  could  send  to  family  and  friends.  MyRedNeptune  has  also  started  collaborating  with 
other Scratch  users. For  example,  she  has made  tools  for  others  to  use,  like  an  animation  of  a 
running  cheetah  based  off  National  Geographic,  and  she  has  worked  on  a  game  with  4  other  
kids from 3 different countries. 

Mitch went on to share photos and videos from Bangalore, where an MIT student traveled to run 
a weeklong workshop to support students  in exploring the  local ecology of their community. The 
students  did  a  community  mapping  exercise  where  they  used  phones  to  take  photos  of  local 
animals and plants, as well as  their water  pump  and  sewage area. They used  their own bodies 
to  measure  distances.  After  making  a  3-D  paper  map,  students  used  Scratch  to  make  videos 
that  show  how  dynamic  the  natural  interactions  of  their  region  can  be.  The  videos  were 
downloaded  onto  handheld  devices,  and  the  handheld  devices  were  embedded  into  the  paper  
map.  The  students  then  took  the  map  around  the  community  to  show  people  what  they  had 
learned.  In  this  workshop,  students  used  ICT  like  craft  materials,  analogous  to  paper  and 
markers  and  glue  sticks.  Mitch  wants  to  see  more  people  using  ICT  to  get  his  or  her  own  
message across, rather than just listening to other people’s messages. 

Mitch’s  research  group  is  now  creating  kits  for  students  to  design  physical  interfaces,  such  as 
steering  wheels,  to  go  along  with  the  games  that  they  create.  The  goal  is  to  give  students  the 
experience  to  develop  practical  skills  for  thinking  creatively,  reasoning  systematically  and  
working  collaboratively.  The  instructors  note  that  today’s  lecture  could  be  especially  useful  for  
teams  interested  in  doing  educational  projects  during  their  IAP  trips.  More  educational 
resources  are  also  available  from  the  Edgerton  Center’s  outreach  initiative,  run  by  Amy 
Fitzgerald, at http://web.mit.edu/edgerton/outreach/. 

Hands-On Scratch Activity: 
The  students  spent  the  rest  of  the  class  doing  a  hands-on  activity  in  collaborative  storytelling 
with Scratch, an  interactive program  for creative expression.  In  this activity, students attempt  to 
make  their  own  video  project,  but  shift  computers  before  they  finish  so  that  they  can  work  on

Logistical Announcements: 
A movie called Living with AIDS will be shown  in class next Wednesday.  It  is a difficult movie  to 
watch  about  HIV/AIDS  in  Zambia,  but  it  is  important  to  learn  about  this  issue  that  so  many 
people face, particularly in Southern Africa. 

There  will  also  be  a  concrete  lab  this  Friday.  In  order  for  each  country  team  to  learn  different 
technologies,  team  members  should  choose  to  attend  different  sessions  out  of  the  four  being 
offered.  One  group  will  make  a  peanut  sheller.  Another  group  will  learn  how  to  make  a 
reinforced  latrine slab. A  third group will be making porous blocks  for an  infiltration well, and  the 
last  group  will  be  making  a  charcoal  crusher  to  crush  carbonized  corn  cobs  into  powder  for 
making briquettes. 

The  assignment  this  week  is  to  live  on  $2/day  for  7  days.  Half  of  the  world  does  it  every  day. 
The  budget  is  meant  to  cover  all  food,  transportation  and  entertainment  –  students  can  rest  
assured  that  the  assignment  is  not  meant  to  limit  anything  required  for  their  health  or  their  
academic  careers,  such  as  medicine  or  bus  fare  to  get  to  a  class  at  Harvard  on  time.  To  keep 
the  assignment  simple,  students  are  not  required  to  pro-rate  their  rent  payments,  toiletries  and 
utility  bills.  Several  students  in  the  class  had  some  clarifying  questions  about  the  rules  and  the 
possibility  of  bending  them. While  students  are  free  to  be  creative,  the  point  is  not  to  be  eating  
free  food  at  MIT  events,  but  to  really  try  living  on  $2/day  in  an  attempt  to  begin  understanding 
some  challenges  that  are  faced  by  people  living  in  poverty.  Students  will  have  to  consider  the 
trade-offs  involved and make  tough decisions, because  taking a bus  instead of walking  in order 
to  get  somewhere  faster  would  mean  less  money  for  food.  Choosing  to  buy  more  varied  and 
nutritious  foods,  such  as  vegetables  and  dairy,  can  be  more  expensive  and  mean  much  less 
quantity  of  food  compared  to  buying  grains  and  starches  in  bulk,  like  a  bag  of  rice  or  potatoes. 
For  this  assignment,  students  are  expected  to  keep  a  record  of  everything  they  spend  and 
reflect on  insights gained  from  this experience afterward. This  is  not  an  exact  duplication of  the  
experience  of  people  living  in  poverty,  but  the  idea  is  to  have  the  students  learn  to  appreciate 
what  people  go  through  when  living  on  $2/day.  It  is  important  to  recognize  that  people  in  
developing  regions  would  also  have  to  stretch  this  income  to  cover  healthcare,  education  and 
other expenses such as soap, lighting and cooking fuel.
