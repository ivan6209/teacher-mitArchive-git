Class Introductions: 
One of  the most  important  things about D-Lab  is  the  community  that  develops within  this  class. 
For  the  class  introductions,  everyone  goes  around  saying  at  least  1  interesting  thing  about 
himself  or  herself  that  is  unknown  to most  other  people. Amy’s  interesting  thing  is  that  she  is  a 
direct  descendant  of  the  Mary  who  had  a  little  lamb  from  the  childhood  song  –  hands-on 
education runs in her family. 

Stakeholder Roleplay: Wheelchairs for the Developing World 
To  kick  off  a  discussion  on  the  relationships  between  different  stakeholders  in  development, 
students  participate  in  a  roleplaying  activity  as  donors,  providers,  manufacturers  and  users  of 
wheelchairs. Each student receives a color-coded role information sheet, and begins by meeting 
with  others  playing  the  same  role  to  discuss  and  fully  understand  their  position.  After  making  
sure everyone  is on the same page, the students group themselves by color so that each role  is 
represented. Everyone  introduces  their  role  (keeping  their objectives  and  special  instructions  to 
themselves)  before  beginning  the  negotiations.  Different  roles  can  ask  each  other  questions  to 
learn more  about  the  situation  and  people  involved. Some  teams may  find  it  difficult  to  come  to 
a consensus and decide how to proceed. 

During  the debrief, several students comment  that  there were a  lot of  things  that  they wanted  to 
say  during  the  discussion,  but  could  not,  due  to  special  constraints  placed  on  their  role  limiting  
their  interactions with  the  rest  of  the  group. Another  student  shares  that  she  did  not  feel useful, 
as she wasn’t asked to share any useful information that she did have and did not have answers 
to  the  questions  she  was  asked.  Amy  clarifies  that  the  roles  are  set  up  in  a  particular  way  to 
simulate  the complexities and  limitations  in  real negotiations, so no one should  feel guilty about 
playing  their  role.  For  example,  some  roles  are  not  supposed  to  volunteer  any  information,  but 
only  answer  direct  questions,  as  there  are  cultural  differences with  communication  and  sharing 
information.  Some  students  playing  these  types  of  roles  may  became  frustrated  if  they  were 
overlooked by the more vocal positions during the discussion. 

The  time  allotted  for  the  roleplay  is  also  very  short,  so  there  is  not  a  lot  of  time  for  teams  to 
share  information,  discuss  and  make  a  decision.  One  group  believes  that  crucial  pieces  of 
information  did  not  come  through  in  their  discussion,  making  it  harder  for  them  to  come  to  a

consensus  when  they  could  not  figure  out  everyone’s  motivations  and  interests.  A  group  may  
have  the  same  goal,  but  may  not  realize  it  or  may  struggle  to  find  a  way  to  achieve  it.  People  
are  passionate  about  their  own  approaches,  so  they  may  even  view  other  approaches  as 
challenging  rather  than  collaborative,  even  though  development  is  supposedly  a  collaborative 
field.  There  can  be  blinders  when  people  are  so  driven  by  a  mission  or  passion.  For  instance, 
those who are giving money may not  always have  the complete picture, sometimes hearing  just 
a  few  things  and  becoming  focused  on  them  before  hearing  from  all  the  stakeholders 
(particularly the users). 

Many students admit that they got a little creative and ended up breaking out of the expectations 
of  the  role  to  find  a  solution.  It’s  important  to  start  with  the  rules  of  the  roleplay  as  a  guide,  but 
you  do  not  have  to  let  the  roles  define  you.  About  a  third  to  a  half  of  the  students  playing  the 
NGO  management  role,  users  or  parents  followed  the  special  instruction  to  refrain  from  speak 
freely  and  only  answer  direct  questions.  It  is  not  always  common  for  a  wheelchair  user  to  be 
present  during  a  decision-making  meeting,  but  even  when  they  are,  they  may  not  volunteer 
information  as  freely.  Some  of  this  may  be  cultural  –  at  the  International  Development  Design  
Summit  in  Ghana  this  past  summer,  Amy  noticed  that  students  from  the  US  participated  a  lot 
while  their  Ghanaian  teammates  could  barely  get  in  a  word,  even  though  they  knew  the  most 
about  the  context of  the projects. Western  students are often  trained  to  volunteer  their opinions 
all  the  time,  compared  to  people  from  elsewhere  who  may  have  more  relevant  information  but 
may  not  have  as  many  opportunities  to  share  it  and  tend  to  be  more  soft-spoken.  It  is  an 
interesting dynamic. 

Students  talk  about  how  they  struggled  between  a  moral  standpoint  or  keeping  their  job.  One 
role  in  particular  has  indicators  and  performance  goals  (a  certain  number  of  wheelchairs)  that 
are  supposed  to be met  for  their company, but  feedback  from  users has been  that  those  chairs 
are  not  particularly  useful.  A  student  shares  that  they  felt  bad  about  pushing  hard  about  the  
money, but  they were  representing  someone who did not want  to  see  their organization  die  off. 
It  can  be  complex  when  people’s  livelihoods  depend  on  certain  funders,  who  may  be  more 
motivated  by  short-term  incentives  to  show  growth  than  long-term  sustainable  impact  support  
livelihoods.  In  one  group  meeting,  the  discussion  almost  became  a  contest  for  who  could  give 
the most eloquent argument to the funder and throw out the most supporting numbers, while the 
wheelchair  user  and  parents  felt more  like  spectators  and  were  less  empowered  to  participate. 
Think about what it takes  to really create a  level playing  field  for negotiation. There may be  a  lot 
of unbalances with power and social status.

In  the  real  world,  places  are  often  littered  with  broken  wheelchairs  –  not  only  are  there 
wheelchairs  that  break  after  a  few months,  but  there  are  even  chairs  that  cause  physical  harm 
(that  can  lead  to  sores  and  eventually  even  death)  –  yet  people  are  still  pushing  them  out, 
because  the  incentive  is  to  send  more  chairs  out  rather  than  making  sure  that  we  are  sending  
good  quality  chairs.  Someone may  hold  a  fundraiser  here,  for  example,  to  raise money  to  ship 
used  wheelchairs  from  the  US  to  people  living  in  poor  communities  of  Guatemala.  At  first 
glance,  this might seem  like a worthy  cause, but  it  is  important  to  try  to  find out more about  the 
situation  before  deciding  to  support  it.  Are  the  chairs  appropriate  for  the  intended  use?  How 
robust  are  the  chairs  and  could  they  be  fixed  in  Guatemala,  or  do  they  contain  fragile 
specialized parts with no locally available replacements? 

In  this  class,  D-Lab  does  not  want  students  to  develop  a  jaded  mentality,  but  rather  a  healthy  
and  realistic skepticism  that  takes  into account  the complexity of  the situation and  tries  to  figure  
out  what  may  be  the  best  solution  for  sustainable,  long-term  impact.  It  often  helps  to  start  by 
looking at something that has worked a little better than other programs, and then build on it. No 
one really knows what the best answer is, necessarily. 

The D-Lab Philosophy: 
Before  getting  too  far  into  the  semester,  Amy  wants  to  get  into  the  D-Lab  philosophy  a  little  to 
give  students  a  sense  of  where  this  approach  comes  from.  [Please  Note:  It  is  not  easy  to 
capture and  represent  this philosophy well  through written notes, so  readers are encouraged  to 
take a  look at the D-Lab website (http://d-lab.mit.edu) for more details. A video of Amy speaking 
on  the  D-Lab  philosophy  will  eventually  be  posted  online,  as  part  of  a  library  of  resources 
entitled “D-Clips.”] 

What does the “D” in D-Lab stand for? What are some of our guiding principles? 

Development:  the  belief  that  development  actually  can  happen  and  that  there  are 
sustainable ways for communities to go about it 

Design: technologies can have a role in improving people’s lives 

Dissemination: technologies alone cannot have an impact, however – we need to get these 
technologies into the hands of users 

Dialogue  &  Discovery:  emphasis  on  learning  from  people  who  have  more  direct  
interactions with the users or from the users themselves (D-Lab teams don’t have the hubris 
to  believe  that  they  can  make  the  most  effective  lasting  change  over  a  single  IAP  January  
period,  but  it  is  important  to  go  and  talk  to  people  and  try  to  experience  life  in  the  region  
firsthand, rather than just reading about it, to get a sense of what people’s needs are) 

Not everything that D-Lab values has to start with a “D” (this is not Sesame Street): 

Respect:  it  is  really  important  to  respect  the  communities we  are working with  to  truly work  
together (realize that education and intelligence have very little to do with each other – some 
of  the  smartest  people  you  meet  may  never  have  attended  primary  school,  so  we  need  to 
shake  up  our  preconceptions  coming  from  MIT),  but  also  remember  to  respect  your  own 
capabilities and offer to contribute in ways that you are able 

Humility: recognize  that there are also  issues  in our own society and be open  to  learning (a 
student  once  said  they  wanted  to  “show  people  how  to  live,”  which  is  not  what  D-Lab  is 
about)

Optimism,  Idealism  &  Enthusiasm:  these  are  what  keep  people  in  this  field  going,  as 
development work is not easy – we do not want to discourage people from thinking they can 
make  a  difference,  but  we  want  people  to  think  about  how  they  can  do  it  in  a  sustainable 
way  (Amy  is proud  that she  left  the Peace Corps as  idealistic as when she started, which  is 
considered fairly rare) 

“The real optimist sees even an empty glass as half full ” –  A m y   S m i t h  

We  should  remember  to  be  idealistic,  to  do  the  work  in  the  best  way  that  we  can  think  of, 
and to do it with enthusiasm. 

Amy goes on to describe her transformative work in a refugee camp in Uganda. One of the most 
brutal violent conflicts occurred  in northern Uganda, and communities are starting  to move back  
to  their  villages  after  20-25  years  in  refugee  camps.  Amy  was  invited  to  work  with  these 
communities to show them  technologies that could be useful and ease this transition. When she 
visited  with  a  graduate  student  named  Kofi,  they  found  that  there  were  not  a  lot  of  workshops, 
access to local blacksmiths, and such, so they decided to just teach everyone how to make corn 
shellers on  their own. Amy and Kofi were excited  to  see how people got  really engaged  –  even 
people  who  have  never  worked  with  metal  before  or  thought  of  themselves  as  makers.  When  
they  returned  the next day,  there were stacks of  nicely-made corn shellers  that were being sold 
at half price within the community, and at full price  to neighboring communities. This experience 
has  solidified  Amy’s  belief  that  we  can  work  with  communities  in  a  respectful  way,  really 
believing in the capacity of people to make technologies to impact their own lives. 

D-Lab  wants  to  build  the  creative  capacity  of  communities,  changing  the  paradigm  so  that  
people  feel  empowered  to  build  their  own  technologies,  instead  of  having  the  expectation  of 
being  merely  recipients  of  technologies.  This  is  a  very  exciting  and  revolutionary  methodology 
that  D-Lab  is  actively  promoting,  and  it  goes  against  how  a  lot  of  development  work  has  been 
done  historically.  A  few  groups  are  also  taking  a  similar  approach  – Whirlwind Wheelchair  has 
wheelchairs  users  actually  designing  and  building  their  own  chairs.  D-Lab  asks  students  to  be 
open  to  experiencing  this  and  to  bring  their  enthusiasm,  interest  and  willingness  to  work  with 
people.  Bring  your  nerdiness!  Jump  in  and  try  to  learn  and  experiment  and  do  something.  In 
Ghana, the D-Lab team  tried  to build a well together with  the community despite the fact that no 
one had done so before, but everyone jumped right in and got muddy and worked hard together 
– and they made it! 

“You cannot do this work if you fear mud”  -   J o h n   M a n u  

Also,  do  not  expect  people  to  do  things  for  you.  When  a  D-Lab  team  needed  wood  for 
demonstration,  the  students  just  took  axes  and  chopped  their  own wood, even  though  the men 
in the community were more than willing to help. It should be part of the D-Lab ethos to clean-up 
after  yourself.  After  a  community  demonstration,  the  team  took  straw  and  helped  to  sweep  up 
the  community  space  so  they  would  not  leave  extra  work  for  the  women.  Be  willing  to  take  
initiative  to  help  out  and  do  things  –  not  only  is  it  the  right  thing  to  do,  but  you will  learn  a  lot  in  
the  process.  [Amy  takes  this  opportunity  to  point  out  to  the  class  that  they  have  might  noticed  
how  the  regular  rows  of  chairs  and  tables  got  displaced  during  the  group  activity,  so  students 
should feel free to jump in and help rearrange the classroom afterward.] 

Finally,  it  is  always  important  to  think  carefully  about  what  you  are  asking  people  to  do, 
especially  when  you  are  working  with  people  who  are  living  under  $2  a  day.  Are  you  asking 

Page 4 of 5 

people  to  risk  their entire  crop by  trying a new  technology, which may  still be at  the  stage of an  
untested prototype? You cannot just say, “oh, maybe this will work if you put raisins in the soil.” 

These  are  just  some  of  the  useful  ways  you  can  think  about  approaching  development  work. 
There may be  a  naïveté  in  this  approach,  but  there  is  also  a  strength  in  believing  in  your ability 
to  do  good.  D-Lab  is  challenging  students  to  look  at  all  these  different  dimensions,  not  to  
discourage them, but to empower them to take action in a positive way. 

The class discussion on stakeholder analysis will continue next Monday.
