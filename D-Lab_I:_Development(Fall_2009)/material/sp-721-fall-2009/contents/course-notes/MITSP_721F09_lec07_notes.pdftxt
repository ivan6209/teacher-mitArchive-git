Class Outline for September 28, 2009: 
•	 Community Partner Presentations 
•	 Demonstration of Irrigation Technologies 

Community Partner Presentations: 
The  students  learned  about  D-Lab’s  community  partners  and  potential  projects  in  Honduras, 
Nicaragua,  Ecuador,  Brazil  and  Peru.  Last  week,  they  heard  about  Tanzania,  Zambia,  Ghana, 
Rwanda,  Sierra  Leone,  China  and  India.  These  presentations  inform  the  students’ 
selection of which regions they would like to work in during the January trip.  Students  will  be 
matched  into  teams  to  prepare  for  their  trips  throughout  the  semester.  The  first meeting  is 
scheduled  to  be  during  class  next  week,  followed  by  weekly 2-hour meetings outside of class. 

Demonstration of Water Transport Technologies: 
Students split into teams to try out different technologies and help irrigate the lawns of MIT: 

Drip  irrigation  kits  provide  targeted  irrigation  to  plants  while  using  less  water.  Paul  Polak  of 
International  Development  Enterprises  (IDE)  saw  that  there  were  many  large  drip  irrigation 
systems  available  for  commercial  farming,  but  no  affordable  small-scale  drip  irrigation  kits  for 
small plot farmers. IDE spent years developing these drip irrigation kits and now sells them for a 
price of a couple of dollars, which  includes profit margins for the manufacturers, distributers and 
retailers. The main components of the kit are listed below, along with their functions: 

•	 Lined bag – holds water 
•	 Front valve – dispenses water 
•	 Lead – brings water from the bag to the main 
•	 Main – runs along one side of the plot 
•	 Submains (lateral lines) – bring water from 
the main to the rest of the plot area, punctured 
with straws at location of plants 
•	 Straws – distributes water to plants, can be 
tied into knots to control flow 
•	 Poking device – makes holes in the tubing 
for straws 

The Q-Drum  is  a  tire-shaped  container  fo
r  transporting water  that  has  a  rope  tied  through  it  for 
pulling.  It  allow   you  to  transport  w  ter  by  rolling  it  behind  you  instead  of  carrying  it  on  your 
s
a
head,  which  is  how  most  people  carry  water  after  collecting  it  from  wells.  Students  said  that  it 
felt easier  to use  the drum  than  to carry water by bucket, but  they also  recognized  that  they are 
not  used  to  carrying  buckets  and  are  not  efficient  at  it.  The Q-Drum  can  roll  over  the MIT  lawn 
relatively  easily  and  handle  slight  hills,  but  does  not  work  well  on  rough  ground  or  for  river 
crossings.  [Aside:  Amy  tried  to  adapt  the  Q-Drum  design  to  transport  clay  in  Ghana.  At  clay 
mines  in  Ghana,  women  can  carry  up  to  150  pounds  of  clay  on  their  heads  to  sell  as  coloring 
pigment  in  the market.  It can be hard  to pull  the Q-Drum behind you over  rough ground when  it 
is  filled with  heavy material,  so Amy  designed  a wheelbarrow  version  that  you  can  push  ahead 
of you instead.]

The  treadle pump has  foot pedals  that  the user  steps on  to bring water up  from  the ground  for 
irrigation.  The  device  saves  time  and  effort,  compared  to  raising  water  by  bucket  from  a  well. 
Treadle  pumps  were  invented  decades  ago,  but  were  not  really  mass-manufactured  until  IDE 
started making and selling them to farmers in parts of Asia and Africa. KickStart has also started 
selling  treadle  pumps  under  the  name  MoneyMaker.  Treadle  pumps  enable  farmers  to  grow 
more water-intensive crops or continue farming during dry season, allowing them to fetch higher 
prices  in  the  market  to  increase  income.  The  pumps  are  sold  for  a  price  of  about  $50,  which 
covers  margins  in  the  supply  chain  and  has  a  relatively  short  payback  period  of  a  couple  of 
months.  The  device  is  portable  and  can  be  moved  between  wells  or  rivers.  By  depressing  the 
foot  levers,  treadle pump users can create a pressure gradient  that  lifts  the water  from a source 
and  then  pushes  it  through  a  one-way  valve  and  into  storage  or  a  distribution  channel.  The 
pumps  can  be  connected  to  multiple  distribution  hoses,  which  are  often  gravity  driven,  or  to 
canals  for  irrigating  larger  fields.  While  treadle  pumps  are  mostly  manufactured  centrally  and 
then  distributed,  they  can  also  be  made  locally  in  a  village.  Both  the  metal  frame  and  the 
actuators,  which  are  typically  injection-molded,  can  be  made  from  bamboo.  There  is  limited 
scalability of the bamboo version, however, as the valves are typically still made from rubber. 

This  hands-on  activity  provided  students  with  an  opportunity  to  learn  how  to  use  these 
technologies,  gain  a  better  understanding  of  how  they  work,  and  experience  firsthand  some  of 
the  design  issues.  It  is  important  that  students  leave  class  with  some  practical  knowledge  of 
irrigation,  as  they  may  be  working  to  improve  these  technologies  during  the  semester  and 
demonstrating  them during  the  fieldwork  trip  in January. The Peru  team,  for example,  is  looking 
into using bamboo for some drip irrigation kit components.
