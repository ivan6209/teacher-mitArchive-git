Working in small teams, students complete a sequence of eight group project
assignments, culminating in a final presentation and report on the country and
projects for the IAP field trip.
***** Prior Year Projects *****
The prior year's D-Lab: Development class (2008) worked on the following
projects. Many of these projects have been worked on for several years, with
incremental improvements and innovations by each year's class.
                               Course projects.

***** Group Assignments *****
**** Group Assignment 1: Agricultural Project Assessment ****
As a group, your team will research the agricultural situation in your country
so that you understand the physical as well as the political and economic
environment that affect farmers in your partner community. Identify the key
crops that are grown, and investigate the types of equipment used to process
them. Determine what government policies affect farmers, what the markets are
like (both physical as well as theoretical) and other issues that affect what
farmers choose to grow or raise. You should also investigate the division of
labor based on gender and other social and cultural issues. Based on your
research, outline some potential projects that you might work on at your site.
Your team will present your findings in a short report (about 5 pages).
**** Group Assignment 2: Post-Harvest Processing ****
Your team will be given a sample of an agricultural product to process (either
peanuts to be shelled or corn to be shelled or ground). As a group, you will
process the product in three different ways and measure the quality of the
output and the throughput rate. In addition, each team member should write a
paragraph to reflect upon their experience. You may feel free to include
pictures and graphs as part of the assignment. Turn in one report per group.
**** Group Assignment 3: Making Charcoal ****
As a group, your team will make a small batch of charcoal briquettes. You will
find the equipment you need (pots, pans, spoons, graters cassava, carbonized
material, charcoal crusher and briquette makers) in the D-Lab room. In order to
make binder, use a 1:10 ratio (by volume) of grated cassava to boiling water.
You will need about 250 ml of binder to make your briquettes (and about 250 g
of crushed charcoal). Be sure that you allow enough time for the briquettes to
dry before turning them in. You can dry them in the sun or leave them in the
fume hood in the lab. Please be sure to clean up the lab when you are finished.
Turn in your briquettes in a well-labeled, sealed bag.
**** Group Assignment 4: Village Energy Assessment ****

**** Group Assignment 5: Water Testing Worksheet ****
Assignment description (PDF)
Please complete this in your country groups, and submit one completed worksheet
per group.
**** Group Assignment 6: Water Testing Materials List ****
As a team, think about the possible water projects that you will be doing and
what sort of testing will be involved in these projects. Start to prepare a
list of the supplies that you will need for the tests you need to perform.
Create a list on your D-Lab Team wiki. Make sure that you discuss this during
your country team meeting during the week of Ses #24-26, and finish the list by
the end of that week.
**** Group Assignment 7: Country Team Presentations ****
Each team has 7 minutes to present the projects on which you will work during
the IAP field trips. The purpose of this presentation is to promote
collaboration between groups that may be working on the same projects. It also
will give the course staff a chance to see your team's progress toward
successful projects this January.
Though it is not required, if you have any experiments or prototypes to
present, please bring them along. Not everyone in your team need present. If it
makes sense, you may, if you like, choose one or two people to present for your
team.
**** Group Assignment 8: Final Posters and Presentations ****
First of all, each team has 7 minutes to present, we will be strict about this
time limit, so be sure you practice in advance and work out the timing. Second,
we will be grading each presentation in the following way:
                       Grading criteria.
