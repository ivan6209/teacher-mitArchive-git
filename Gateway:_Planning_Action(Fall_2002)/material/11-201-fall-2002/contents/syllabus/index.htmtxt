***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session
***** Format *****
The class consists of 5 units. Unit I introduces some classics from the
planning literature. Units II, III and IV are based on case-studies of Boston,
Mexico City and Rotterdam. Each of these units will last 4 classes. The first
class will consist of a 2-hour presentation of the case; the second class will
meet in sections for students to discuss the case. In the third class, groups
of 5 or 6 students will present a group project to the class, based on
guidelines set out by the case-study presenter. In the fourth class, the class
again meets in sections to discuss the group projects. Each student will
participate in one group project over the course of the term. At the end of
each unit, students who did not give a group presentation will submit a 5 page
memo commenting on the case in light of the initial planning action framework
presented in the 1st unit. Unit V will provide a course wrap-up, focus on the
future of the profession of city planning and will also include an in-class
final to evaluate mastery of the required readings.
***** Evaluation *****
Each student's grade will be based on
    * his or her team presentation and project,
    * performance on the two required individual memos,
    * in class and on-line participation, and
    * performance in the final.
***** Logistics *****
This class will take advantage of the resources provided by the class website.
It is your responsibility to consult it regularly for updates in the syllabus,
reading list, and assignments. All the readings for the class will be available
for download from the website. Also, all materials presented in class will be
posted on the site. The website also has a discussion forum capability which
you are encouraged to use to continue class discussions.
At the suggestion of previous MCP students, students have randomly been
assigned to study groups of 6 or 7 students. The first student in each of these
groups is its coordinator. These groups are encouraged to meet on their own
time (once a week for an hour, or as they see fit) to discuss assigned
readings, group presentations, memo assignments and to serve as a small support
group. These sections are separate and different from both class discussion
sections and project groups. The study group assignment can be found at the end
of this syllabus, on-line. On the same sheet, you will find a number (from 1 to
4) before each name. This refers to the section you have been assigned to for
in-class discussion.
A project sign-up sheet will be circulated on the first class. Every student
must sign-up for one project group. There will be 4 groups (of 5 and 6
students) preparing reports on each case study. Students who do not fill out
this sheet in class will be randomly assigned to a project group. By the second
class, the finalized listing of project groups will be available on the class
website. Groups will be allotted 30 minutes (including 10 minutes for
questions/discussion) for their presentation during the 3rd class for their
unit. Project groups are responsible for working with the course TAs to make
sure that their presentation is available on the course website no later than
2pm on the day of their presentation. It is highly recommended that the
presentation be online prior to it being given in class. At the end of the
course, the project groups are expected to submit a full write-up based on
their in-class presentation.
Students not involved in a group project will be responsible for submitting
individual assignments on that unit. The detailed assignment guidelines will be
available on the course website. The assignment must be handed in to the
Gateway TAs at the beginning of the class marking the beginning of the next
unit. Late assignments will not be accepted without a reasonable justification.
***** Course OutlineUNIT I: The Framework: Taking Action *****
The introductory lectures outline a theoretical framework for thinking about
planning action. Students will be introduced to some classics from the planning
literature in the context of a seven-step model of planning practice.

    * Key Dilemmas in Thinking About Planning Practice
**** UNIT II: Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning: Taking Action In Boston's
South End ****
The case will focus on the urban renewal planning process undertaken in
Boston's South End during the early l960's. That process, a comprehensive
effort to revitalize the neighborhood both physically and socially was part of
a city-wide effort to use the federally-funded urban renewal process as a way
of "turning around" Boston- both its Downtown and its neighborhoods. The Boston
Redevelopment Authority's (BRA) previous approach to neighborhood planning had
been to clear the site. But planning for residential and commercial
rehabilitation required the active involvement of residents and neighborhood
institutions. The challenge confronting the South End planning team is how to
engage residents and other "stakeholders" in a productive and supportive
planning process.

**** UNIT III: Who's the Hostage Here? Planners, Peasants, and Politicians in
the Sitting of the Mexico City Airport ****
In October 2001 Mexico's Secretary of Communications and Transport announced
the Federal Government's decision to build a new state-of the-art airport on
agricultural lands 30 miles northeast of Mexico City. Peasant protest -- which
involved a national and international media campaign and, ultimately, hostage-
taking -- pushed the President to cancel the plan and consider other sites in
the metropolitan area, much to the dismay of private sector developers and
others who strongly promoted the project. In this unit, we use this case study
to ask questions about the possibilities and limits of citizen protest, about
the challenges of planning for a metropolitan region cross-cut by three levels
of government, about the dilemma of balancing local, regional and national
development aims, about the relationship between planners, politicians, and the
private sector, as well as about the use (and abuse) of technical versus
political and social criteria in the planning process.

**** UNIT IV: Sustainable Development in Rotterdam- Planning or Innovation?
****
Efforts to achieve sustainable development in the Netherlands are characterized
by several conflicts. One is the conflict between the tradition of planned
development and the demands sustainability creates for ongoing adaptation,
innovation, and learning. The second is the "institutional void" (Hajer)
created by the mismatch between the formalized planning practices and the
informal networks in which deliberation about emerging problems occurs. A third
is the disruption caused by social tensions between new (especially immigrant)
communities and the consensus on core social values that has underpinned
social, economic, and physical planning in the Netherlands. Finally, planning
and development are shaped by the pull of demands for greater integration with
global and European political and economic networks and increasing expectations
for among stakeholders at the local level to shape the decisions and actions
that will affect their lives. In this unit we will look at what planning and
innovation suggest for the design of an intervention that can begin to enhance
urban sustainability and livability in tangible ways in the face of these
tensions.

**** UNIT V: Composing a Professional Life as a Planner ****
The content and style of planning education should reflect a clear view of the
roles that planners play, the responsibilities they are expected to assume, and
the skills (and analytic capabilities) they need to be effective. This section
of the Gateway class will provide an opportunity for us to share our views on
these topics. The week of panels will bring practitioners from the Department's
five program areas to campus to talk with students about their practice. Our
goal will be to give students a "boost" in their efforts to think ahead about
how they want to use their two years at MIT.
