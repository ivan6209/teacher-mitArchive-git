Lecture 1: Introduction: Selections from Genesis.
Lecture 2: Aristotle. Selections from Physics.
   1. The word physis in Greek means nature; the title of this book might well
      be The Nature of things. Aristotle believes that understanding anything
      has to do with identifying the sort of thing it is and that this
      identification depends upon being able to identify its inherent principle
      of changeâchange in appearance, in location, in motion. Do we believe
      that change is inherent in things? Or is it always induced by
      externalities? Or a combination of both?
   2. Understanding the nature of things depends upon asking the right
      questions about them. The answers, for Aristotle, are aitaia - word
      usually translated as causes, but perhaps better translated as becauses,
      for they are the answer to a properly formulated question about why
      something is the way it is. Aristotle offers four aitai. What are they?
      Can you give an account of them?
   3. We can easily think of kinds of things that have no intellectual
      significance (Example: all physical objects that are approximately five
      inches from the nearest wall) or things that might have significance but
      do not exist (phlogiston, witches); but Aristotle believes that everyday
      perception and a trained intelligence can see into the nature of
      thingsâget at the inherent principle of change in things. Is this a
      naive assumption? Is it still in operation today?
   4. The inherent tendency to change is called eidos by Aristotleâusually
      translated as form, but it is also the ancient Greek word for idea and
      also for species. Do you see any connection between these things? He has
      a quarrel with the philosopher Antiphon about whether eidos is inherent
      or external in chapter one of Book II. What is the nature of the quarrel?
   5. Aristotle believes that there are two features of the world that do not
      submit to understanding the nature of things - luck or chance (tyche) and
      spontaneity or coincidence (automaton). What is his understanding of
      these features and how does it differ from our own?
   6. Inherent principles of change each make for change in a particular way.
      This way is called its telos, its end, its aim, its goal. Things in the
      world all possess a telos, and the purposeful activities of human beings
      constitute only one sort of teleological activity. Do we still employ
      teleological descriptions of the nature and activity of things? If things
      are properly described teleologically, does it follow that they have
      purposes?
   7. In chapter eight, Aristotle considers the idea that things happen, not
      "for the sake of something", that is, in accordance with an end, an aim,
      or a goal, but rather of necessity, "just as rain falls, not to make
      crops grow but of necessity." What is his argument against this view?
Lecture 3: Carroll, Lewis. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.
   1. The story of the temptation in the Garden of Eden raises questions about
      the value of knowledge and of the state of innocence, which is without
      knowledge of a particular kind. Pre-pubescent children are often
      considered to be innocent in this way. How innocent is Alice? How would
      you describe her general character?
   2. The text says that Alice is always eager to learn a new sort of rule. Is
      this generally true of children? What sort of rules is Alice eager to
      learn? Are these sorts of rule akin to the rules of a game? How do they
      differ?
   3. The text begins with Alice looking over the shoulder of her sister and
      finding the book she is reading dull because it has no pictures or
      conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book without pictures or
      conversations?" Well, what is the use of such books? What sort of book do
      you imagine her sister is reading? Does the childish view that such books
      are useless carry any weight in your view?
   4. Many of the jokes in Alice depend upon word-play and might be thought
      beyond the range of a child's appreciation, both because of the
      sophistication of word-play and because of the seriousness of the
      underlying topicâfor example, the jokes about death. There is a joke
      about death in the first chapter, when Alice thinks about the length of
      her fall down the rabbit-hole and speculates that she very likely
      "wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the
      house!", to which the narrative immediately adds (in parenthesis), "which
      was very likely true." It is tedious to explain a joke but understanding
      the Alice books depends upon such explanations. How does the word-play
      enable the joke here? How many other jokes about death can you find in
      the book? Granted that children cannot understand them, how would you
      describe the reader to whom Carroll is addressing his book?
   5. After a fall, the main character discovers a lovely garden but cannot
      enter it. Is this an allusion to Genesis? (T.S. Eliot thought that it
      was.) When Alice eventually gets into the garden, does it meet her
      expectations?
   6. Alice has moments when she wonders whether "she is herself" - a phrase
      that also works as a pun, as in "I am not quite myself today" or more
      particularly, the Victorian rebuke to children who have just committed a
      breach in good manners: "Take care, young lady. Remember who you are."
      Examine the ways in which Alice tries to decide whether she herself or
      not in Chapter Two. Is it reasonable to determine who you are by showing
      yourself what you know?
   7. Much of the book's nonsense turns out to be sensible under a different
      set of rules. In reciting her multiplication table, Alice seems wildly
      astray and remarks, "Oh, dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate."
      Is there a system of multiplication in which the remark would be
      mathematically true?
   8. By the same token, the remarks of the creatures in Wonderland do not seem
      to make any sense, but sometimes turn out to be sensible, once you grant
      the odd circumstances in which the creatures live. At the Mad Tea-Party,
      for instance, Alice thinks of one of the Hatter's remarks that it "seemed
      to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English."
      Although Alice does not notice the fact, the rest of the conversation
      makes the Hatter's remark clear. What is the meaning of it? Find other
      events and circumstances in the story that can be described in sentences
      that might seem to have no sort of meaning to them and yet are certainly
      English. How easy is it to describe everyday realities in ways that seem
      to have no sort of meaning to them and yet are certainly English? Does it
      tell us anything about the ways in which we live that we can describe
      them as riddles?
   9. A good deal of the book has to do with changing size. How would
      Aristotle's causes fit the changes endured by Alice in the book?
Lecture 4: Voltaire. Candide.
   1. Explanatory note: Candide was published in 1759, more than a half century
      after Newton's Principia, during that period of European intellectual
      history known as the Enlightenment. At the time Newton was held to have
      decisively shown that the universe to be not a heterogeneous assemblage
      but a vast system, every part of which affected every other part
      according to universal laws. Aristotle's notion of physical reality left
      room for chance or merely random events in the material universeâthings
      that just occur or happen to be the case, without being part of some
      larger order built into the structure of physical nature. Newton's notion
      of physical reality did not leave such room; in the Newtonian system,
      whatever occurs or is the case may look random but rightly understood it
      is capable of explanation in terms that apply to everything else, as part
      of the universal system of things. Newton's continental rival in
      philosophy, Leibniz, articulated this idea as "the principle of
      sufficient reason", according to which everything that occurs in the
      physical universe can be explained by adducing conditions sufficient to
      guarantee that it will occur as it does and not otherwise, down to the
      last detail.

      This is this principle that apparently lies behind the arguments of Dr
      Pangloss, when he says, for example: "There is a concatenation of all
      events in the best of possible worlds; for, in short, had you not been
      kicked out of a fine castle for the love of Miss CunÃ©gonde; had you not
      been put into the Inquisition; had you not traveled over America on foot;
      had you not run the Baron through the body; and had you not lost all your
      sheep, which you brought from the good country of El Dorado, you would
      not have been here to eat marmalade and pistachio nuts." Sufficient
      conditions guarantee that something will happen as it happens and not
      another way, and everything that happens or ever will happen has such
      conditions, which have their own conditions in turn. The universe, then,
      is an ongoing "concatenation of events" from which alternative
      possibilities are banished. If room is to be found for possibilities,
      they must lie in alternative worlds, each of which, if it existed, would
      realize events other than those realized in the actual universe. The
      events that constitute such alternative worlds are possible according to
      the physical laws that govern the actual world, but they are not possible
      in the actual world, because the determinate sufficiency of all actual
      events to guarantee the actuality of all other events rules them out.

      Contemporary science-fiction makes use of the notion of physically
      possible "alternative worlds" as if they could somehow exist side-by-side
      with the one that we inhabit, but this use flies in the face of Leibniz's
      conception, which was that such worlds cannot exist, even though they are
      physically possible.
   2. The idea that all events cannot be otherwise than what they are, down to
      the last detail raises a problem in trying to account for the reality of
      human choice. Is it just an illusion? The issue is raised explicitly at
      the end of chapter five, when Pangloss is arrested by the Inquisition for
      denying the existence of free will. Pangloss sees no contradiction of
      free will in his views, but the arresting officers take no notice and
      arrest him anyway. What do you think Voltaire had in mind when he wrote
      this scene into his book?
   3. The essential phrase for Pangloss is that this is "the best of all
      possible world's" â the phrase derives from Leibniz but is not original
      with him. The idea behind it is that, just as Pangloss maintained,
      everything that happens, even the outcome of human choice, happens as it
      does because God, in creating the universe, chose to create one possible
      world out of an infinite number equally possible from the standpoint of
      universal physical laws, and the Creator's nature is such that the best
      is bound to be chosen. Leibniz did not simply announce his view of the
      Creator's nature or the validity of accepting a Creator's existence, but
      his arguments supporting his view do not concern us here. Rather, our
      interest lies in the fact that the view afoot in Voltaire's day about
      possible worlds was directed to the point of explaining that what looks
      like evil is really good and appears evil only because we do not know
      enough about the complexity of thingsâmuch as one might suppose that
      Aristotle's allegedly random events are not actually random but only seem
      random because we do not know enough about the circumstances sufficient
      to cause them.


      As an example, here is a passage in which Leibniz (in his Metaphysical
      Discourses) discusses the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, a prime example of
      evil to the eye of faith at the time:


      ". . . in general one can say that . . . it must be that this evil will
      be repaid with interest somewhere else in the universe, that God will
      derive a greater good from it, and in short it will be found that the
      sequence of events which include the existence of this sinner [Judas] is
      the most perfect of all those which were possible. But to explain in
      every instance the admirable economy of the particular choice, that
      cannot be done while we inhabit this transitory sphere; it suffices to
      know it [as a general principle] without understanding it [in its
      application to every particular case]."


      What does it mean to say that God created "the most perfect" world rather
      than "a perfect world"? Does it show that God cannot create anything
      absolutely perfect? Does it make evil something less than evil to say
      that "on the whole" it produces good?
   4. Consider the generality of the idea that "this is the best of all
      possible worlds." Is it a message of optimism, as the subtitle of Candide
      implies or is it, perhaps, a message of pessimismâas if one were to
      shrug in the face of suffering and say, yes, this is as good as it gets,
      and it is foolish to expect any better? The glass of happiness can be as
      much as half-full only on condition that it is half-empty. Recall
      Candide's question after his flogging at the auto-da-fÃ©: "If this is the
      best of all possible worlds, what must the others be like?" In this
      connection, consider Pangloss and Martin as each devised by Voltaire to
      represent opposite views of the glass of happiness.
   5. Consider the subtitle of the book: "Optimism". Is it well-chosen? Why not
      call the book Candide; or Innocence? In this connection, compare the
      innocence of Candide in the world that he inhabits with the innocence of
      Alice in Wonderland.
   6. Any account that takes the existence of evil in the world as a problem
      that confronts belief in an omnipotent and benevolent deity is called a
      Theodicy. (Leibniz wrote a book with that title in 1710.) A theodicy
      proposes to justify or vindicate the ways of God to man. There are
      generally two kinds of theodical argumentâone which traces the
      existence of evil to humanity's imperfect angle of vision and one which
      traces it to necessities in the plan of Creation. In what ways are the
      two kinds of argument complementary? In what ways are they mutually
      exclusive? How would Voltaire conceive the relation between them?
   7. Theodicies usually concern evils of the sort represented in the book by
      the Lisbon earthquakeâthat is to say, natural evils. We might instance
      the brevity of human life or the natural struggle for existence or the
      vulnerability of animate life to painful afflictions, like cancer. But
      the Lisbon earthquake and two storms at sea are all that Candide affords
      by way of natural evil. Most of the evils in the book are human in
      origin. How seriously is the notion of evil taken up in the book? Again,
      consider that the leading figures in the story are comic in physical
      characterâthat is to say, like creatures in animated cartoons, they can
      be mauled, mashed, flayed to the bone and run through with swords, but
      they are never irrevocably damaged by such injuries; left for dead, they
      are resurrected and reappear in the story. How does this affect the
      depiction of human evil? Is it an advantage to a text ostensibly bent on
      mocking optimism or an imperfection?
   8. At midpoint in the book, Candide visits a utopian commonwealth, an ideal
      sort of human society called El Dorado. What are its social arrangements?
      What are its religious institutions? Why does Candide choose to leave
      this place? Are his reasons good ones? Are they appropriate to a
      character who is otherwise innocent and trusting about the world? Is
      Candide better or worse for having experienced it? How does El Dorado
      function as an episode at the central point of a book that is largely
      concerned with the shortcomings of human existence?
   9. Where, in all this scornful rejection of the notion that all is for the
      best, do we find Voltaire's own position? In the remarks of the Dervish?
      In the attitude of the ruler of El Dorado? In Martin's embrace of
      Manicheanism? In Pococurante's disdain for human vanities? Do those who
      speak in the book against the idea of "the best of worlds" all speak with
      the same voice?
  10. Elucidate the meaning of what appears to be the book's final
      lessonâthat we should cultivate our own garden. How well does the
      phrase sum up the meaning of the book as a whole?
Lecture 5: Hume. Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. (Through Book V in the
excerpts.)
   1. At the outset of the dialogues (not reprinted here), one of the listeners
      refers to the "accurate philosophical turn of Cleanthes", "the careless
      skepticism of Philo," and "the rigid, inflexible orthodoxy of Demea." The
      first paragraph in our excerpt gives the basis of Demea's position. What
      about it makes for "rigid, inflexible orthodoxy"?
   2. How good is Cleanthes's case that the whole universe is one vast machine,
      composed in turn of lesser machines? How does it differ from the case
      advanced by Balbus in Cicero's dialogue?
   3. How close is Cleanthes's argument both here and later in the text to
      Aristotle's view of telos?
   4. In Part II, Philo argues that ideas have an inherent principle of
      organization and that without experience, one might well suppose that
      material parts might have a principle of organization in themselves, too.
      But experience convinces us otherwise, and this, he says, is the heart of
      Cleanthes's view that the organized character of the universe implies a
      Divine Creator. What would Aristotle say of the distinction that Philo
      suggests between matter and mind?
   5. Expound Cleanthe's argument about the "vegetable library". Why is it
      invoked? How valid is the analogy to the case that he is making?
   6. What is the force or validity of Cleanthes claim that without
      anthropomorphism, the worship of deity is atheism?
   7. Cleanthes argues (in Part IV) that you have sufficiently accounted for a
      machine by pointing to the mind that invented it. Philo insists that this
      is like accounting for the movement of the earth by arguing that it is
      carried on the back of a celestial elephant. What is at issue in this
      quarrel and who has the better of it?
   8. How convincing is Cleanthes's argument about the eye, in Part III? How
      would you refute it?
   9. Compare Philo's example (in Part V) of the ship and the carpenters who
      made it with Cleanthes's view that design is a mark of an intelligent and
      knowledgeable designer. Is it an effective refutation?
  10. At one point (in Part VII), Philo resorts to the alleged plausibility of
      the view that the universe is not a machine but a vegetable. Is the move
      valid? What issue does it address? Does it suggest a fallibility in
      Cleanthes's position?
  11. When Philo (in Part VIII) introduces the notion that, given an infinity
      of time the chance movements of atoms alone must sooner or later create
      an ordered universe, Cleanthes counters with the thought that the
      universe is not merely ordered but is benevolently ordered. Rightly or
      wrongly, the difference between organized ideas and disorderly or random
      matter is presented as intuitively apparent by Philo; is it intuitively
      apparent that the arrangment of things in the world is benevolently
      intended? Suppose it looks like a benevolent arrangement: why cannot the
      random motions of atoms create it, given an infinity of time? In any
      case, is this turn in the argument a novelty or is their an ethical idea
      lurking in the very notion that the various parts of the world are well
      fitted to each other?
  12. In Part X, Philo succinctly poses "the problem of evil". What is your
      sense of this problem? Is it a real one? Cleanthes believes that the
      problem affords the clearest evidence of the advantage of his view of
      God. Is he right?
  13. At the end of the dialogue, the transcriber of them offers the judgment
      that Cleanthes argued best in the discussion. Most scholars believe that
      Hume wrote this view into the end of his text in order to pacify the
      majority of his readers, who were possibly not ready for outright
      skepticism with regard to religious matter; these scholar hold that Philo
      gets the best of the argument. What is your view?
Lecture 6: Hume. Dialogues. (remainder)
Lecture 7: Paley. Natural Theology.
   1. Near the outset of Hume's Dialogues, Cleanthes and Philo argue about the
      closeness of the analogy between machines or human artifacts and things
      in nature. Consider the difference between the manner in which Paley
      discusses the mechanical aspects of what we would call organisms and
      Cleanthes's assertion that just as stairs were made for climbing, so the
      human foot is made for walking. Does Paley argue for a close analogy or
      does he claim an identity between artifacts and organs? What difference
      does this make to his argument?
   2. At one point in the Dialogues (Part VIII), Philo concocts the notion that
      the mechanical aspects of organisms, which show an adjustment of parts to
      each other that sustains the whole, resulted simply by accident, as the
      material parts of the universe blindly rearranged themselves over the
      infinite course of time during which the universe existed. As self-
      sustaining entities arose, there would be nothing to stop their increase;
      as soon as any disintegrated, their parts would be incorporated into
      other self-sustaining entities. "It is in vain," Philo concludes,
      "therefore, to insist upon the uses of the parts in animals or
      vegetables, and their curious adjustment to each other. I would fain
      know, how an animal could subsist, unless its parts were so adjusted? Do
      we not find, that it immediately perishes whenever this adjustment
      ceases, and that its matter corrupting tries some new form?" This
      explanation is sometimes taken to offer a decisive answer to Paley. How
      good a rebuttal is Philo's conjecture to the point that Paley is making?
      Paley deals with this argument in Ch. V, sec iv of his book. How
      convincing is he in dismissing it?
   3. Again, Cleanthes's view is that the universe is "one great machine,
      subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines, which again admit
      of subdivision to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can
      trace and explain." Consider Paley's remarks upon astronomy and explain
      why he considers Cleanthes's view a good reason not to try fetching
      proofs of God's existence from hypotheses concerning the nature of the
      universe as a whole.
   4. Paley draws a good deal of his argument from the example of the watch
      found lying in an unpopulated area. How good is the example to make his
      point? He enumerates some of the suppositions that underlie his claim for
      an immediate perception that the watch is an artifact, and not a random
      arrangement of material parts. How good are these suppositions?
   5. Paley says that the eye alone is enough to prove the existence of a
      Creator, just as a single hydraulic machine would be sufficient to
      convince us that it was designed by a workman, provided we understood its
      workings and its use, and never saw another machine in our lifetimes. Is
      there anything wrong with this argument?
   6. In chapter III, Paley concludes his argument about the eye by asking why
      the Deity resorts to contrivances or mechanisms rather than supplying
      creatures with vision as an immediate quality. Deity can work
      miraculously and is not bound by obedience to the physical laws of
      Creation; we might add (as Paley does not) that even today many
      philosophers suppose that reason and human consciousness are just such
      immediate, unmechanical qualities. "Why resort to contrivance, where
      power is omnipotent? Contrivance, by its very definition and nature, is
      the refuge of imperfection." Two questions arise in this connection.
      (a) How sensible is the idea that sight might simply exist as a quality
      without any mechanism? Consider in this connection that Paley is at pains
      to argue that the eye is not "a perceiving organ" but a mechanismâas he
      puts it, an instrument of sight, like the telescope. If the eye is a
      contrivance for seeing, like the telescope, then what does the seeing?
      (b) How does Paley account for God's resort to contrivance? Does it, in
      fact, manifest God's imperfection?
   7. Paley offers a chapter on "compensatory structures", in which "the
      defects of one part, or of one organ, are supplied [i.e., made up for] by
      the structure of another part or of another organ." How close does the
      argument come at this point to echo the Leibnizian claim that on the
      whole, all is for the best? AIf there are defects without compensation,"
      says Paley, "I suspect that they have been misobserved." Do you suppose
      that he is right or wrong in this supposition?
   8. Some efforts at theodicy tried to justify the ways of God to man by
      pointing out how much of the world seemed created to suit human
      necessities. In this sense, the "best" in "the best of all possible
      worlds" meant "best for us humans." Thus Cleanthes, at the end of Part
      VIII of Hume's Dialogues, offers the camel as something created to serve
      mankind as a beast of burden in desert areas. How much of this suiting of
      the world to mankind is present in Paley? Consider his remarks (in
      chapter XVII) about the adaptation of night to the requirements of human
      sleep. In his private notebooks in 1838, Darwin chastised the philosopher
      Whewall, who thought that the length of the terrestrial day had been
      adapted to the duration of human sleep. Darwin called it "insufferable
      arrogance" to suppose that the solar system was adapted to mankind and
      not the other way around. Is Paley guilty of this kind of arrogance?
Lecture 8: Smith, Adam. Wealth of Nations. (selections)
   1. What does Adam Smith mean by "wealth"? When the stock-market fell
      dramatically in March of 2000, economists estimated that the world had
      lost a significant proportion of its wealth. Some people were puzzled: if
      the sum of wealth in the world was lost, where did it go? Could Adam
      Smith help explain their puzzlement?
   2. Smith begins his ground-breaking exposition by talking about the
      production of pins in a pin-factory. Why does he introduce his subject in
      this way? What features of the manufacture of pins are important to his
      general theory about the nature of wealth? What is the most important?
   3. Smith notes that despite his example of the pin-factory, production of
      individual manufactured goodsâsay, items of clothing or
      furnitureâseldom took place at one location, as in a modern industrial
      plant, but was generally carried out in stages distributed over distinct
      locations. How does this feature affect his characterization of the
      nature of mankind's economic life?
   4. Smith lays emphasis upon self-interest as the vital factor in economic
      lifeâthe engine that drives the system. Is self-interest a good thing,
      a bad thing, a neutral thing? Is it, in Smith's view, to be distinguished
      from selfishness? "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the
      brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to
      their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity, but to
      their self?love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of
      their advantages." The economic life of mankind is founded upon a regard
      that looks no further than one's own needs and desires in every
      individual case. How can such a limited view be responsible for the
      maintenance of a system that benefits everyone?
   5. Our excerpts close with Smith's famous statement about an "invisible
      hand". Explain what he means by this phrase and develop some of its
      implications.
   6. Smith's account of the economic system has frequent implications for
      theories about the nature of political life, as when he says that
      differences in intelligence and character between people is not the cause
      but the effect of the division of labor. What are some of the other
      political implications of his theory? Admittedly, economic theory today
      has strategic implications for political practice. Does it have direct
      implications about the norms that ought to govern political life?
   7. Smith makes a distinction between the value in use of a good or a product
      and its value in exchange. He also distinguishes between the real price
      of something and the actual price. Explain the two distinctions and the
      relation between them.
   8. Along with his views on the division of labor, Smith regarded the
      distinction between the real and the actual price as a major feature of
      his theory. It derives from the idea that the medium of exchangeâor
      currencyâwhich serves a measure of the value of goods in exchange is
      not the real measure of value; rather, according to Smith, the real
      measure of something's value is the amount of labor that goes into
      producing it. What does Smith mean by labor? Why is labor best suited to
      the job of measuring the value of things? What notions are involved in
      estimating the amount of something that is used to measure the amount of
      other things? What difficulties attend determining the amount of labor
      required to produce anything and how does the economic system overcome
      them? Is Smith account of labor entirely consistent?
   9. The real (or natural) price of things is distinct from the actual (or
      artificial) price of things by factors not essential to the economic
      systemâ"accidental" fluctuations in supply and demand of one sort or
      another. The actual price itself is further distinguished into the market
      price and the natural price. The language used by Smith is describing
      this distinction is worth recalling: "The natural price," he writes,
      "therefore is, as it were, the central price, to which the prices of all
      commodities are continually gravitating. Different accidents may
      sometimes keep them suspended a good deal above it, and sometimes force
      them down even somewhat below it. But whatever may be the obstacles which
      hinder them from settling in this center of repose and continuance, they
      are constantly tending towards it." The phrases not only allude to the
      Newtonian theory of the system of the material universe, they also
      describe the hovering about a value characteristic of negative feedback
      mechanisms, like thermostats and steam-engine governors. How is the idea
      of negative feedbackâa term not yet coined in the languageâessential
      to Smith's theory?
  10. Smith says that the value of the labor which goes into producing anything
      is divided into three portions or shared out three ways after
      exchangeâa portion in wages, a portion in profit, and a portion in
      rent. Is it essential to Smith's theory that these portions are actually
      distributed among different people, each belonging to different economic
      classes? Or are their recipients theoretical postulates such that a
      single person might belong to any one, two or even three, depending upon
      circumstance? What issues hinge upon the answers to these questions?
  11. How does Smith account for the fact that the wealth of a nation can
      increaseâthat whatever the value of the materials and goods that go
      into a cycle of production, it is possible that a greater value of goods
      and materials comes out of it? Is the increase identical with profit?
Lecture 9: Malthus. Principles of Population.
   1. Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is an argument about the possibilities of
      a certain kind of progress, namely, the material improvement of the
      condition of human life. Malthus's argument builds on Smith (not
      directly, but by implication) but Malthus reaches an opposite
      conclusionâthat the mechanism of economic life condemns mankind to be
      perpetually at the same point of material progress. (It was as a result
      of Malthus's work that economics in the nineteenth-century came to be
      known as "the dismal science".) How much of Smith is there in Malthus?
   2. Smith seems in one passage of our readings virtually to state Malthus's
      point, as part of his argument that the production of human beings, like
      the production of commodities, is something regulated by market forces.
      He writes: "Every species of animals naturally multiplies in proportion
      to the means of their subsistence, and no species can ever multiply
      beyond it. But in civilized society, it is only among the inferior ranks
      of people that the scantiness of subsistence can set limits to the
      further multiplication of the human species; and it can do so in no other
      way than by destroying a great part of the children which their fruitful
      marriages produce." Yet Smith does not reach Malthus's conclusionâquite
      the reverse. How do you account for the difference between them?
   3. There is an old puzzle that is posed about Malthus. If human being
      multiply "geometrically" (we would say "exponentially", why cannot the
      species upon which humanity is nourished multiply geometrically as well?
      Does this question show an insufficiency in Malthus's argument or is it
      based on a misunderstanding of it?
   4. Malthus is not heartless in respect of the sufferings of the poor or
      their exploitation at the hands of the wealthy. Consider the long passage
      about the real and the nominal price of labor at the end of Chapter II
      and his remarks about those who employ laborers and complain about the
      fact that wages do not fall when food becomes cheap. He quickly reaches
      the conclusion, however, that doing away with a wealthy class will only
      spread poverty not wealth. Given this conclusion, he finds a value in the
      existence of a wealthy class and condemns the ideal of an egalitarian
      society. What is the function of the wealthy class, in his view, in terms
      of promoting the general welfare? Why not share poverty and increase, if
      only by a limited amount, the number of those who do not want for
      subsistence in society?
   5. Malthus regards charity for the unemployed poor not only as something
      ill-advised but also as a crime against society. How does he support this
      surprising (and dismal) conclusion?
   6. At the outset of Chapter XVII, Malthus argues, against Adam Smith, that
      it is not labor in general but only agricultural labor that increases the
      material wealth of mankind. How good are his arguments?
   7. Darwin claimed to get his inspiration for the decisive idea behind his
      theory of natural selection while reading Malthus one day for
      intellectual recreation. To be sure, some of the elements important to
      Darwin's thinking are in the textâthe notion that more members of any
      species are born that can possibly survive, the harshness of competition
      for sustenanceâMalthus even used the phrase "struggle for existence" at
      one point, though without Darwinian reference. Yet just as Smith did not
      anticipate Malthus, so Malthus fails to anticipate Darwin. Indeed, in
      Chapter 9 he even invokes the idea of a limit in the change that
      selective breeding can impose upon sheep (with the implication that
      species are fixed, not changeful) as an illustration of the fact that the
      conditions of human life cannot be much altered by the ingenuity of
      mankind. What notion or notions does he lack which Darwin might have
      found elsewhere in order to bolster the idea that the conditions of life
      in the natural world are constantly changing, even though they are the
      effect of events that take place according to fixed natural laws?
   8. The great impediments to even modest improvement in the human condition
      overall are miseryâthe inability of those economically distressed to
      care for their childrenâand vice, the failure of human beings to
      abstain from the pleasures of sexuality. Malthus considers neither the
      immense improvements that might be made in food-production through
      technology nor the practices of various forms of contraception, which
      modern science has made increasingly effective. Is his argument outdated
      on either of these scores?
   9. With regard to the latter point, there are still some who consider
      contraception an evil to be discouraged and still more who consider it an
      inalienable right (so enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations) for
      human beings to have as many children as they wish. Would violating this
      alleged right make Malthus's argument irrelevant? Or (making allowances
      for the fact that Malthus does not address the issue directly) can
      Malthus's argument be adapted to deal adequately with this objection?
  10. Since Aristotle, there has been a distinction habitually drawn between
      nature (physis) and human civilization (nomos). Arguments for supporting
      a belief in the progressive improvement of the human condition have
      usually drawn upon this distinction. How much does Malthus draw
      civilization into the orbit of nature? A number of environmentalists have
      applauded Malthus for the way in which his argument sets determined
      limits to the alleged "conquest of nature" by human civilization. Are
      they right to do so?
  11. Malthus concludes his text with a theodicy. What is its character? How
      acceptable do you find it?
Lecture 10: Malthus. (continued)
Lecture 11: Darwin. On the Origin of Species. (Excerpts from Signet edition.)
   1. Darwin begins with the deliberate selection practiced in the breeding of
      stock-animals and moves to the notion of unconscious selection. What is
      the point of this strategy? How does unconscious selection work? What do
      humans consciously select for? What do they unconsciously select for?
   2. Darwin was at pains to say that his theory was a theory of Natural
      Selection and not a theory of evolution. In fact, the word "evolution"
      does not appear in the book; the last word alone, evolved, is the only
      place where a cognate of "evolution" is used. Why do you suppose this is
      so?
   3. Darwin refers at one point (in chapter 3) to "the delicate balance of
      nature". What does that phrase imply? To what extent is it appropriate to
      what Darwin is talking about?
   4. Chapter 3 is entitled, "The Struggle for Existence". Where is that
      struggle most intense, from the standpoint of its relevance to the origin
      of species?
   5. To illustrate the "web of complex relations" that constitute Nature at
      any moment, Darwin invents an example having to do with the presence of
      "old maids" in a village area and the prevalence of red clover. What is
      the moral of the example? What is its relevance to the notion that global
      cataclysms have been imagined by some theorists to explain the sudden
      extinction of species that is revealed in the geological record of the
      planet?
   6. Discuss Darwin's personification of Nature near the outset of Chapter 4.
      Does it help or confuse the argument to make Nature into an agent that
      does the selecting?
   7. To obviate possible confusions on this score, Darwin was eventually
      persuaded by colleagues to add to or substitute for "Natural Selection" a
      phrase borrowed from the philosopher Herbert Spencer, "the survival of
      the fittest." Is this phrase a good one for the job that Darwin wanted it
      to do?
   8. In the light of Darwin's over-all conception, how adequate is the idea of
      a treeâthe typical image, which Darwin himself invokes, for
      representing lines of descentâto serve as an analogy for what Darwin is
      talking about?
   9. Darwin is also at pains to insist that Nature, in exercising selection,
      acts only "for the good of each being", as if Nature were a beneficent
      agency. How appropriate is this implication to the theory? Is the history
      of life in Darwin's view a history of progress and improvement? If so,
      what is the direction of progress? What is it that gets improved and in
      what respect is it improved?
  10. What is meant by convergent evolution? How does Darwin regard the idea
      and why does he regard it in this way?
  11. Darwin says that adaptative traits (he uses the word "characters") are
      always beneficial to a species. Working with some of his examples, would
      you say that it therefore must also be beneficial to the individual
      members of the species, which possess the traits in question?
  12. A source of much confusion among Darwin's first readers was the
      difference between "individual differences" and "single variations". What
      is the difference and why is it a possible source of confusion if the two
      ideas are mixed up?
  13. In the first edition of the Origin, Darwin suggested that the habits and
      instinctual behavior of a species might be transmitted from generation to
      generation, just as anatomical features might be, but he omitted the
      suggestion in subsequent editions. Can you guess at his reasons for
      withdrawing the suggestion?
  14. Like most important notions, the concept of adaptation is not
      straightforward. One might suppose that a sheep capable of browsing both
      on mountainsides and level plains and therefore adept at the area in
      between would have a selective advantage over sheep capable of just doing
      one or the other, but Darwin argues for the reverse conclusion. What is
      his reasoning and how important is the issue to his theory?
  15. The idea of the eye as an "organ of extreme perfection" was already dealt
      with in Hume's Dialogue. It was a well-entrenched idea and the source of
      much early criticism of Darwin's views. What difficulty does the idea of
      "organs of extreme perfection" raise for Darwin's theory? How well does
      he deal with it? What becomes of the notion of perfection in his hands?
  16. In this connection, an important idea in Darwin's time was the notion
      that every sort of creature is extremely well-adjusted by reason of its
      anatomy to its necessities and to the habits that go with satisfying
      them. This adjustment of habit with anatomy and of both to the creature's
      habitat was an important point in the theory of special creation. What is
      the theory of special creation? What are its ramifications in thinking
      about the biosphere as a whole? What Darwin's view of this theory and why
      does he take the position that he occupies with respect to it?
  17. Darwin distinguished between analogy and homology in identifying the
      "characters" or traits of different species. What is this distinction and
      how important is it to Darwin's conception of the adaptiveness of
      organisms to their habitats?
  18. In connection with our reading of Paley, we have encountered the notion
      that many natural philosophers took an anthropocentric view of the
      design-features of organisms, arguing that e.g., the hump of the camel
      was created for the benefit of nomads, who might have a beast of burden
      fit for desert places. In this connection, a familiar example was the
      rattle of the rattlesnake, which many believed was put there by a
      benevolent Providence to warn reasonable creatures of the danger posed by
      the rattlesnake. Darwin's term for a generalized version of this notion
      is the utilitarian theory, the idea that creatures have traits whose
      primary function is to benefit other creatures. How does Darwin deal with
      the "utilitarian theory"? Darwin poured particular scorn on the theory
      about the rattlesnake. How would he explain the existence of the rattle
      in the tail of the rattlesnake?
  19. A prime example of the "utilitarian theory" concerned the adaptation of
      the social insects to the interests of the group, the most familiar
      instance being the sting of the bee, which is fatal to the insect that
      uses it. Why does this instance raise a difficulty for Darwin's theory
      and how does he deal with it?
  20. Several times in the book, Darwin cites the maxim: "Nature is prodigal in
      variety, though niggard in invention." What does this phrase mean? He
      believes that his theory can explain the truth of the maxim and the
      theory of "special creation" cannot. Why? In your view, is the truth of
      the maxim confined to the biological world or does it apply to
      civilization as well?
  21. Near the end of his book, Darwin repeats Hume's analogy about the savage,
      looking on a ship as a wondrous contrivance quite beyond human
      comprehension. Explore the analogy in the context of Darwin's argument.
      Which side would Darwin have taken, Philo's or Cleanthes's?
  22. How would Darwin speak about "the environment", should he have been
      transported to the present and stumbled across this phrase?
Lecture 12: Darwin. On the Origin of Species. (continued)
Lecture 13: Darwin. On the Origin of Species. (continued)
Lecture 14: Butler, Samuel. Erewhon.
   1. "Erewhon" is, of course, nowhere spelled backwards, with a slight
      concession to pronounceability. It is a utopia, an imaginary society
      whose ways have some bearing on our own. During the nineteenth-century,
      imagining a perfect society became a common motive for fiction, but
      Butler's Erewhon is more on the order of Swift's Gulliver's Travels, the
      kind of imaginary place which has a good deal of absurdity about it. We
      have already dealt, briefly, with one utopiaâthe place called El
      Dorado, in Voltaire's Candide. How much similarity is there between the
      two?
   2. The flora and fauna of Erewhon are much like those of Europe and so are
      the artifactsâthey are different, but obviously of the same families.
      The people, however, are of greater beauty. What accounts for this? Is it
      worth the price?
   3. Social institutions in Erewhon are also of the same genera as European
      social institutions, but there is an overriding difference in certain
      cases. Erewhon has a number of institutions which, in the case of their
      real-life counterparts, may be considered in opposition to some other
      institution. For example, since Jesus said that one cannot serve both God
      and Money, we might think that the church was an institution opposed in
      some respect to banking and finance. Both church and banks exist in
      Erewhon but here one of the two institutionsâin this case, the
      banksâseems to have acquired some aspects of its opposite. Are there
      other instances of this blurring of opposition? Describe Erewhonian
      banking in some detail, pointing out the resemblance to conventional
      religious practice. What is the point of the two systems of currency? Is
      the net effect to make religion look absurd or banking or both? If the
      church can be represented by dealings in currency, is the suggestion that
      money has spiritual properties?
   4. The same trick is tried with practices designed to correct evils for
      which one cannot, in the real world, be held responsible, and practices
      designed to correct evils for which one can be held responsibleâfor
      medicine and criminality, in short. How much truth is there in this
      reversal of values? Is there any measure of truth in supposing that one
      should be cured of having a malign will and punished for the bad luck of
      contracting an illness? Do we, in the real world, ever punish bad luck?
      (Butler has his narrator offer an instance in which he claims that we
      do.) How clear is the distinction between responsible agency and external
      determination in real life?
   5. Mixing up opposites in this way creates puzzles about Butler's satiric
      targets. What is the satiric target in the episode where a wife
      apologizes for her husband's absence by saying, not that he was ill, but
      that he had unhappily stolen a pair of socks that morning? What is the
      point of the joke when we learn that in Erewhon it is considered a nasty
      insinuation to ask "How do you do?"âa question that inquires into the
      condition of one's health? How much truth is there in the words of the
      judge who sentences someone for the crime of ill-health: "You say, in
      exoneration of your offense, that it is your misfortune to be criminal; I
      answer that it is your crime to be unfortunate"?
   6. In what way do those who treat people for theft resemble doctors? In what
      ways do they resemble priests? We seem to reach the heights of absurdity
      when we encounter the judge who says to a defendant convicted of the
      crime of catching a fatal disease that if the jury had found him
      innocent, he would have convicted the defendant anyway, because the
      defendant would then have been guilty of having had the bad luck to be
      wrongly accused of a crime. Is there anything in the actual world that
      could be the target of this paradox?
   7. A final reversal: the Erewhonians treat birth as if it were a death and
      life before birth as if it were life after death. Explore the oddities
      that result from this reversal, especially in connection with attitudes
      that obtain between parents and offspring.
   8. In the last chapter of Darwin's Descent of Man, Darwin speaks of mankind
      as a "dominant" species. The word reflects the idea of "dominion" used in
      the first chapter of Genesis to describe the relation between mankind and
      other creatures. Is Darwin's use justified?
   9. The most Darwinian part of Butler's Erewhon is the "Book of the
      Machines", much of which turns upon the notion of domination. Are
      machines servants of mankind or is mankind servant to the machines? How
      Darwinian are the arguments that Butler's imaginary author uses to
      support the second alternative? Butler's original audience thought that
      he was mocking Darwinism, and Butler protested (in a preface to the 2nd
      edition) that he was not: his purpose, he said, was to mock certain texts
      that used misused analogies in order to argue for the existence of God
      and for the notion that many aspects of the world had been designed to
      serve mankind's uses. Would you agree with Butler or with his first
      readers?
  10. Against the author of the "Book of Machines", another Erewhonian author
      has written that machines are merely extensions of humanity's relation to
      the world, much as the body is merely an executive agent directed by the
      seat of human identity, the intelligent brain. How good is this argument
      as a response to the notion that our dependence upon machinery is a form
      of domination?
  11. The institutions of higher learning in Erewhon take a cautious view of
      progress in knowledge. What is their view of progress? Do their
      assumptions about the nature of progress resemble our own in any way? If
      there are resemblances, how is it that our views of the virtues of
      progress in knowledge nonetheless differ from theirs? Does it make sense
      that the venerable Professor of Worldly Wisdom should be President of the
      Society for the Suppression of Useless Knowledge and for the Completer
      Obliteration of the Past?
  12. At the end of the Descent, Darwin seems to offer a paradox worthy of an
      Erewhonian professor. The more intelligent members of the human species,
      he says, will refrain from procreating until they can support their
      children, and the less intelligent will not, and so the less intelligent
      are bound to swamp the more intelligent in the population in each
      subsequent generation, leading to the degeneration of mankind. Darwin
      does not explicitly draw this conclusion, but it would seem that
      intelligence as a quality is involved in a situation of negative
      feedback. How Malthusian is this notion? How sensible is Darwin's
      position on this point? Darwin seems to conclude that it would be a good
      thing if overpopulation were allowed to thrive at all levels of society.
      What are his reasons? How good are they?

Darwin. Excerpt from The Descent of Man.
Lecture 17: Stevenson, Robert Louis. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
   1. Stevenson's story is one of the few literary worksâDon Quixote and
      Frankenstein are othersâwhich most literate people know by hearsay
      rather than by direct acquaintance, and they are often surprised when
      they are confronted with the actual text, which turns out to be quite
      different from what they expected. Did the story hold any surprises for
      you and if so, what were they? Of course, Stevenson's original readers
      encountered the tale as a mysteryâthe reader is supposed to be
      surprised to discover at the end of the story that Jekyll and Hyde are
      the same person. Does knowing the solution to the mystery diminish the
      tale in your view?
   2. One response to the story is to take it as a cautionary tale, a simple
      affair carrying the force of a Victorian moral: to give in to wicked
      impulses is to fall slave to the worst side of one's character. How
      adequate is this view of the story? Is it the right view, an incomplete
      view but a good start, or does it get off on the wrong foot altogether?
   3. The story begins with a puzzling relationship between Mr. Utterson and
      Mr. Endfield. What is the nature of their individual characters and how
      do they relate to the theme of the story?
   4. Hyde cannot be described by Enfield except by way of
      contradictionâdeformed without malformationâand he inspires disgust
      and fear, so much so that a doctor at the scene appears to have trouble
      restraining himself from killing Hyde. Mr. Utterson is presented at the
      outset also by way of contradictionâhe is dour, dreary, coldly
      withdrawn, "and yet somehow loveable". What is the point of these
      descriptions of the indescribable?
   5. Hyde is not merely disgusting and fearful, he is degenerateâapparently
      a throwback to some primordial form of existence. Can you develop a
      relation between the nature of Hyde and Darwin's idea of degeneration in
      the Origin? Between the responses of onlookers to Hyde and Darwin's idea
      of the usual response to the notion of mankind descent from a simian-like
      creature?
   6. A chief point of difference between Stevenson's story and the popular
      imagination of the Jekyll and Hyde relationship (derived in part from the
      way that the story has been filmed) is that the popular version presents
      Jekyll's wish to become Hyde as a piece of scientific hybris, a case of
      science treading into forbidden territories. How does this view square
      with the way in which Jekyll describe the motives for his experiment in
      the book? If the result of the experiment does not divide Jekyll into a
      good self and an evil self, how does it divide him? Is the way in which
      it divides him an inevitable result of taking the drug or was another
      result possible?
   7. Describe the character of Jekyll, "a smooth-faced man of about fifty,
      with something sly about his face". Describe the character of Hyde. Why
      is he interested (at the outset of the story) in preserving his
      reputation? Why does he kill himself at the end? What is the attitude
      that Jekyll and Hyde hold of the other? What characteristics does Hyde
      possess that makes Jekyll at once loathe and pity him? Is Hyde evil or
      merely innocent, as an animal might be innocent, in that he possesses no
      conscience, no sense of guilt? Why does Jekyll describe some of his
      characteristics as "wonderful"? Can it be said that he envies Hyde?
   8. Near the conclusion of the tale, Jekyll describes the moment when he
      believed that he had to choose between Jekyll and being Hyde. What are
      the terms of that choice? How is a choice possible, when Jekyll would
      have to make it and in becoming Hyde would cease to exist? What
      advantages follow from being Hyde, as Jekyll understands it?
   9. Suppose that the story were conceived differentlyâthat the drug altered
      Jekyll's character when under its influence but did nothing to alter his
      appearance. What effect would that have on the meaning of the tale, if
      any?
Lecture 18: Stevenson. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. (continued)
Lecture 19: Huxley, Thomas. Prolegomena to Evolution and Ethics.
   1. What is the occasion for Huxley's argument? What view of the implications
      of Darwinism is he trying to discredit?
   2. Huxley opposes the State of Nature and the Human State of Art (that is to
      say, artifice, the intelligent management of things) and insists that the
      two are in conflict. What was Aristotle's view of this relationship? How
      would an intelligent Darwinist argue against Huxley's notion of a
      conflict?
   3. Huxley links the State of Nature with Cosmic Nature and argues that on
      earth human artifice is the product of cosmic nature. If it seems
      contradictory, then, to speak of art as resisting cosmic nature, Huxley
      says, that is just too bad for logic. Is the opposition logically
      contradictory? What are the grounds of your answer?
   4. The emblem of artifice chosen by Huxley is the Gardenâan image of
      nature, by implication, as thoroughly under control of human artifice as
      might be, "where every plant and every lower animal should be adapted to
      human wants and would perish if human supervision and protection were
      withdrawn". How does this garden compare with the garden in Genesis? How
      does its supervision compare with the idea of breeding domestic animals
      in the first chapter of Darwin's Origin?
   5. The Garden is subsequently transformed into a Colony. What are some of
      the implications of the analogy drawn between a colony (in allegedly
      "undeveloped" parts of the world) and civilization? Would Huxley accept
      them?
   6. In the colony, the struggle for existence would be completely abolished,
      among humans as well as among all species under their domestic
      administration. What is Huxley's opinion of this ideal? What is the
      serpent in the garden? Is the ideal good but impractical, in Huxley's
      view, or a false ideal, inherently wrongheaded? Or is it both, a
      wonderful fantasy but an impossible realization and therefore bad the
      moment one attempts to use it as a guide, to put it to any degree into
      practice? In answering, take into account Huxley's view that direct
      selection of the best humans would be undesirable not just because we
      lack the knowledge to select the fittest but also because it cannot "be
      practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the
      bonds which holds society together."
   7. In summing up his view, Huxley speaks of the force antagonist to natural
      selection "the ethical process," which works "in harmonious contrast with
      the cosmic process, by promoting the efficiency of a group, "in the
      struggle for existence with nature, or with other societies", but which
      also "tends to the suppression of the qualities best fitted for success
      in that struggle". What does Huxley mean by "harmonious contrast"? Is
      there any warrant in Darwin's Origin for applying the idea of a "natural"
      selection among combatants in a struggle for existence to groups within a
      species rather than to individual members of a species? What conclusion
      does he draw from the "double-bind" that mankind seems to be placed in by
      the action of natural selection? Is the effort to develop our distinctly
      human nature bound to destroy itself?
   8. Compare Huxley's conclusions with those sketched in the last paragraphs
      of Darwin's Descent of Man. In what sense are Huxley and Darwin
      addressing the same issue? How different are their conclusions?
Lecture 20: Wells, H. G. The Time Machine.
   1. Wells wrote in an essay roughly contemporaneous with this story in which
      he argued that natural selection, having evolved mankind and placed it at
      the top of the pyramid of life, might not be a pro-human force. "There
      is....no guarantee in scientific knowledge of man's permanence or
      permanent ascendancy....The presumption is that before him lies a long
      future of profound modification, but whether this will be, according to
      his present ideals, upward or downward, no one can forecast." Was Wells
      right about natural selection? Are the Eloi and the Morlocks, according
      to present ideals, degenerations of humanity? Or do they each embody a
      version, if perhaps only a partial version, of rival ideals?
   2. At the end of his Descent, Darwin wrote: "Man, like every other animal,
      has no doubt advanced to his present high condition through a struggle
      for existence . . . and if he is to advance still higher, it is to be
      feared that he must remain subject to a severe struggle. Otherwise he
      would sink into indolence, and the more gifted men would not be more
      successful in the battle of life than the less gifted." In Wells's story
      this fear of what indolence might produce applies only to the Eloi, but
      it can be generalized over the human condition, as it is in Darwin's
      statement. As enhanced technology reduces the need for effort, there is
      less differential advantage in strength or intelligence. Arguably, then,
      by a negative feedback mechanism akin to Malthus's checks on population,
      these qualities may reach a "natural" balance with their opposites,
      hovering about, or as Adam Smith would say, "gravitating towards" a
      median limit. How sensible is this speculation, in your view? How has
      Wells managed the construction of his story in order to make the Eloi as
      unintelligent as they are?
   3. The Time Machine begins with a lecture about "the fourth dimension",
      borrowed from Wells's contemporary, Simon Newcomb. How necessary is it to
      the text? Is the way in which the lecture argues for the possibility of
      time-travel sensible, plausible, or silly? Does the science in science-
      fiction have to be good science?
   4. We have got interested in "possible worlds" (shades of Leibniz!) and
      recent science-fiction often plays with the notion of the paradoxes that
      might result if one traveled back and altered our past or if someone (or
      something) from the past traveled back into our time in order to change
      the future. Wells's text does not touch upon these paradoxes that might
      result from time-travel. Indeed, in a sense, the story disavows their
      existence. Otherwise, the fact that the narrator of the story continues
      to hope that the Time Traveller will return one day makes no sense, for
      the Time Traveler ought to be able to return momentarily, as he promised
      to do, if he is able to return at all. Why are paradoxes associated with
      time-travel stories today (like meeting yourself yesterday at breakfast)
      incompatible with the purposes of Wells's story?
   5. The Time Traveler has three distinct speculations about the nature of
      humanity in 802,701 AD and how it got that way. What are the
      speculations? How do they differ from each other?
   6. Recall Huxley's description of a colony "within which the cosmic process,
      the coarse struggle for existence of the state of nature, should be
      abolished; . . . where every plant and every lower animal should be
      adapted to human wants . . ." How much of Huxley's Prolegomena can you
      find in Wells's story? It has been suggested that Wells designed the
      story to illustrate Huxley's argument. How valid is this opinion, in your
      view?
   7. As the remote ancestor of both the Eloi and the Morlocks, is the Time
      Traveler more primitive in any way than they are? Recall that his only
      use for the artifacts in the ancient museum of science is as weaponry.
   8. Just before the Morlock's Feast of the New Moon, the Time Traveler
      glances at the stars. "I thought of the great processional cycle that the
      pole of the earth describes. Only forty times had that silent revolution
      occurred during all the years that I had traversed." Compare this
      reflection with the last sentence of Darwin's Origin. Do they make the
      same intellectual point?
   9. Before returning to the present, the Time Traveler uses his machine to
      travel to Planet Earth's furthest future. What is the function of this
      episode in the story?
Lecture 21: Wells, H. G. The Island of Dr Moreau.
   1. Many readers have often found this text dissatisfying because it does not
      seem to contain a clear point of view upon its materials. In this
      connection, many have claimed that it is an argument against vivisection,
      a tract against cruel forms of experimentation upon animals. What can be
      said against this view?
   2. In the light of your reading of the book, what is the point of the first
      episode, where the men in the life raft consider resorting to
      cannibalism?
   3. What oppresses Prendick about the island at the end of the bookâwhen he
      suffers, so to speak, from a spiritual hangoverâis the aimlessness of
      things there. Is this aimlessness in line with a Darwinian view of life
      on planet Earth?
   4. Prendick's first guess at what Moreau is doing leads him to suspect that
      he is trying to turn men into beasts; he learns that the truth is rather
      the reverse. Is the one occupation worse than the other or are they
      equally horrifying? Why do you think Well wrote this error into the
      thoughts of his main character?
   5. Moreau, of course, sees nothing wrong in what he is doing and argues
      about the meaninglessness of pain? In the view of Prendick, is the extent
      of the animal's sufferings what is wrong with Moreau's experiments or
      does his sense of horror have another source?
   6. Prendick says at one point that he might have "understood" Moreau if all
      this pain was administered for some humanitarian purpose. Would that be a
      valid justification for it?
   7. Prendick muses about the life of the animals on the island: Before they
      had been beasts, their instincts fitly adapted to their surroundings, and
      happy as living things may be. Now they stumbled in the shackles of
      humanity, lived in a fear that never died, fretted by a law they could
      not understand; their mock-human existence began in agony, was on long
      internal struggle, one long dread of Moreau--and for what? It was the
      wantonness that stirred me. (p. 98, Signet edition.) What would Darwin
      have made of the notion of "fitness" expressed in this passage. What are
      the implications of the thought that the animals, having become human
      beings, are now "unfit"âunadapted to their surroundings?
   8. Consider the following passage by Jacques Monod, the Nobel-laureate
      biologist, on the development of language and intelligence, in his book
      Chance and Necessity: "...recent experiments with a young chimpanzee seem
      to show that while apes are incapable of learning spoken language, they
      can assimilate and utilize some elements of the sign language deaf-mutes
      employ. Hence there are grounds for supposing that the acquisition of the
      power of articulate symbolization might have followed upon some not
      necessarily very elaborate neurophysiological modifications in an animal
      which at this stage was no more intelligent than a present-day
      chimpanzee. . . . It is evident that, once having made its appearance,
      language, however primitive, could not help but greatly increase the
      survival value of intelligence, and thus create, in favor of the
      development of the brain, a formidable and oriented selective pressure,
      the likes of which no speechless species could ever experience. . . . We
      see . . . that the selective pressure engendered by speech was bound to
      steer the evolution of the central nervous system in the direction of a
      special kind of intelligence: the kind most apt to exploit this
      particular, specific performance, rich in immense possibilities."


      How does Monod's argument bear upon those offered by Moreau in Chapter 14
      of the book? If there is something arguably horrifying about Moreau's
      view of things, is there anything horrifying about Monod's remarks?
   9. Moreau complains that somehow he cannot get at the seat of emotions,
      which, he says, "harm humanity", that he wants to create a creature which
      is truly rational but the emotions thwart him. Does Moreau himself
      possess the sorts of emotions that he is complaining about? Is he
      striving to create a rational creature "in his own image"? Would this
      make the creature more or less human? Alternatively, is the liability to
      emotion a "mark of the beast", as Moreau claims?
  10. At the end of the text, Prendick seems to have adapted Moreau's view
      about humans, "who lack the calm authority of a reasonable soul." In the
      end, he takes solace from astronomy and the contemplation of cosmic
      rather than planetary nature. Compare this with the last sentence in
      Darwin's Origin. What solace can cosmic nature afford? How would you
      describe Prendick's attitude? Is it an attitude endorsed by the book?
Lecture 22: Wells, H. G. The Island of Dr Moreau. (continued)
Lecture 23: Forster, E. M. The Machine Stops.
   1. The Machine Stops depends upon a difference in the relation between
      people where body-language and nuances of expression carry important
      weight and relationsâsuch as conference-calls like the one that
      preceded the Challenger disasterâthat are managed via the operations of
      machinery. The former is referred to as "direct experience" and the
      inhabitants of the Machine have a horror of it. How valid is this
      opposition? Do we ever encounter each other directly? Our social
      identities have many aspects, and these aspects, more often than not, are
      tied to the considerable variety in kinds of social situations; explicit
      and inexplicit codes and conventions find expression in speech and
      behavior and mediate our experience of one another. Why should talking
      down a telephone, say, be any less immediate than the ritual gestures and
      speech of a conversation in a board room or during a presentation at
      presidential mansion?
   2. Hackers and nerds who frequent internet "chat-rooms" experience a novel
      freedom from their everyday social identities and often claim to have
      developed a series of new ones, to which they give mysterious,
      misleading, or comic names. Can media be a vehicle for the expression of
      an alternate social identity? Consider the difference between tools and
      machines. Tools, we know, can become extensions of one's body. (The blind
      often claim that they feel what their canes are touching, not the cane
      that their fingers are touching.) Is a bicycle a tool or a machine? Can
      automobiles become an extension of your body? How about the hacker and
      his computer?
   3. What does it mean to live inside a machine? Is the machinery simply a
      metaphor, a stand-in for features of human relationships that Forster
      judged adversely? Or is the story actually about machinery and what
      happens to human relationships when human relationships become dependent
      upon machines, particularly in the way of communication? Or can these
      questions both be answered affirmativelyâby raising the possibility
      that the story is about something in human nature (of which Forster does
      not approve) which does not depend upon the existence of machinery but
      which is encouraged by an increasing reliance of human beings to manage
      their relationships with one another by means of machines?
   4. Can people be part of a machine (or a machine-like process)? Would you
      regard the workers on an assembly-line as serving the conveyor belt,
      which embodies an idea of consecutive assembly that the workers do not
      have to grasp to perform their function? Can one regard the factory
      itself as a machine in which the workers are functioning parts?
   5. Workers might be elements of a machine-system but how about staff and
      management? Any corporate entity (e.g., a government or a business) with
      a table of organization regards each element as performing a distinct
      function within the system of the whole, as the system turns input into
      output. Is it necessary to understand how the system works at every stage
      to operate efficiently as a subordinate element within it?
   6. Some specific questions, among others about The Machine Stops: Vashti
      agrees to "isolate" herself to talk to Kuno. Is she in the presence of
      "several thousand people" when she hasn't "isolated" herself? Why does
      she feel that she is "wasting time" when she agrees to talk to only one
      person? What does Kuno mean when he says that mankind is the measure of
      all things? The Book of the Machine is a set of instructions for
      operating the cell inhabited by each of the people of the Machine plus a
      set of timetables for various public facilities. Vashti holds it
      "reverently", kisses it, and feels "the delirium of acquiescence." What
      is she "acquiescing" to? Regard for the Machine is presented in the text
      as a kind of misplaced form of religious worship, and yet there is much
      talk that the present age has successfully banished superstition. Is this
      a contradiction? How about the notion that each year (p. 263.) the
      machine is served more efficiently and less intelligently? Looking at the
      stars or the Himalayas, Vashti thinks, "No ideas here." What sort of
      ideas could one discover simply by looking at such things?
