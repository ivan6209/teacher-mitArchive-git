OF THE CAUSES OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE PRODUCTIVE POWERS OF Labor, AND OF THE 
ORDER ACCORDING TO WHICH ITS PRODUCE IS NATURALLY DISTRlBUTED AMONG THE 
DIFFERENT RANKS OF THE PEOPLE. 

CHAPTER I. 

OF THE DIVISlON OF LABOR. 

The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labor, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, 
and judgment, with which it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division 
of labor. The effects of the division of labor, in the general business of society, will be more easily 
understood, by considering in what manner it operates in some particular manufactures. It is commonly 
supposed to be carried furthest in some very trifling ones ; not perhaps that it really is carried further in 
them than in others of more importance: but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to supply the 
small wants of but a small number of people, the whole number of workmen must necessarily be small ; 
and those employed in every different branch of the work can often be collected into the same workhouse, 
and placed at once under the view of the spectator. 

In those great manufactures, on the contrary. which are destined to supply the great wants of the great body 
of the people, every different branch of the work employs so great a number of workmen, that it is 
impossible to collect them all into the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one time, than those 
employed in one single branch. Though in such manufactures, therefore, the work may really be divided 
into a much greater number of parts, than in those of a more trifling nature, the division is not near so 
obvious, and has accordingly been much less observed. 

To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture, but one in which the division of labor has 
been very often taken notice of, the trade of a pin-maker: a workman not educated to this business (which 
the division of labor has rendered a distinct trade, nor acquainted with the use of the machinery employed 
in it (to the invention of which the same division of labor has probably given occasion), could scarce, 
perhaps, with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the 
way in which this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided 
into a number of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the 
wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; 
to make the head requires two or three distinct operations ; to put it on is a peculiar business; to whiten the 
pins is another ; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper ; and the important business of making 
a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are 
all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of 
them. I have seen a small manufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed, and where some 
of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor, and 
therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted 
themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four 
thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of 

forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, 
might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought 
separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they 
certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the 
two hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part of what they are at present 
capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different operations. 

In every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labor are similar to what they are in this 
very trifling one, though, in many of them, the labor can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so 
great a simplicity of operation. The division of labor, however, so far as it can be introduced, occasions, in 
every art, a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labor. The separation of different trades 
and employments from one another, seems to have taken place in consequence of this advantage. This 
separation, too, is generally carried furthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry 
and improvement; what is the work of one man, in a rude state of society, being generally that of several in 
an improved one. In every improved society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer ; the 
manufacturer, nothing but a manufacturer. The labor, too, which is necessary to produce any one complete 
manufacture, is almost always divided among a great number of hands. How many different trades are 
employed in each branch of the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and the 
wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and dressers of the cloth ! The nature of 
agriculture, indeed, does not admit of so many subdivisions of labor, nor of so complete a separation of one 
business from another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so entirely the business of the grazier 
from that of the corn-farmer, as the trade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. 
The spinner is almost always a distinct person from the, weaver; but the ploughman, the harrower, the 
sower of the seed, and the reaper of the corn, are often the same. The occasions for those different sorts of 
labor returning with the different seasons of the year, it is impossible that one man should be constantly 
employed in any one of them. This impossibility of making so complete and entire a separation of all the 
different branches of labor employed in agriculture, is perhaps the reason why the improvement of the 
productive powers of labor, in this art, does not always keep pace with their improvement in manufactures. 
The most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their neighbours in agriculture as well as in 
manufactures ; but they are commonly more distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the 
former. Their lands are in general better cultivated, and having more labor and expense bestowed upon 
them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural fertility of the ground. But this superiority of 
produce is seldom much more than in proportion to the superiority of labor and expense. In agriculture, the 
labor of the rich country is not always much more productive than that of the poor ; or, at least, it is never 
so much more productive, as it commonly is in manufactures. The corn of the rich country, therefore, will 
not always, in the same degree of goodness, come cheaper to market than that of the poor. . . . 

This great increase in the quantity of work, which, in consequence of the division of labor, the same 
number of people are capable of performing, is owing to three different circumstances ; first, to the 
increase of dexterity in every particular workman ; secondly, to the saving of the time which is commonly 
lost in passing from one species of work to another ; and, lastly, to the invention of a great number of 
machines which facilitate and abridge labor, and enable one man to do the work of many. 

First, the improvement of the dexterity of the workmen, necessarily increases the quantity of the work he 
can perform; and the division of labor, by reducing every man's business to some one simple operation, 
and by making this operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily increases very much the dexterity 
of the workman. A common smith, who, though accustomed to handle the hammer, has never been used to 
make nails, if, upon some particular occasion, he is obliged to attempt it, will scarce, I am assured, be able 
to make above two or three hundred nails in a day, and those, too, very bad ones. A smith who has been 
accustomed to make nails, but whose sole or principal business has not been that of a nailer, can seldom, 
with his utmost diligence, make more than eight hundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several 

boys, under twenty years of age, who had never exercised any other trade but that of making nails, and 
who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each of them, upwards of two thousand three hundred 
nails in a day. The making of a nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same 
person blows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion, heats the iron, and forges every part 
of the nail: in forging the head, too, he is obliged to change his tools. The different operations into which 
the making of a pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of them much more simple, and the 
dexterity of the person, of whose life it has been the sole business to perform them, is usually much 
greater. The rapidity with which some of the operations of those manufactures are performed, exceeds 
what the human hand could, by those who had never seen them, he supposed capable of acquiring. 

Secondly, The advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost in passing from one sort of 
work to another, is much greater than we should at first view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass 
very quickly from one kind of work to another, that is carried on in a different place, and with quite 
different tools. A country weaver, who cultivates a small farm, must loose a good deal of time in passing 
from his loom to the field, and from the field to his loom. When the two trades can be carried on in the 
same workhouse, the loss of time is, no doubt, much less. It is, even in this case, however, very 
considerable. A man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to 
another. When he first begins the new work, he is seldom very keen and hearty; his mind, as they say, does 
not go to it, and for some time he rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering, and 
of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather necessarily, acquired by every country 
workman who is obliged to change his work and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty 
different ways almost every day of his life, renders him almost always slothful and lazy, and incapable of 
any vigorous application, even on the most pressing occasions. Independent, therefore, of his deficiency in 
point of dexterity, this cause alone must always reduce considerably the quantity of work which he is 
capable of performing. 

Thirdly, and lastly, everybody must be sensible how much labor is facilitated and abridged by the 
application of proper machinery. It is unnecessary to give any example. I shall only observe, therefore, that 
the invention of all those machines by which labor is to much facilitated and abridged, seems to have been 
originally owing to the division of labor. Men are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods 
of attaining any object. when the whole attention of their minds is directed towards that single object, than 
when it is dissipated among a great variety of things. But, in consequence of the division of labor, the 
whole of every man's attention comes naturally to be directed towards some one very simple object. It is 
naturally to be expected, therefore, that some one or other of those who are employed in each particular 
branch of labor should soon find out easier and readier methods of performing their own particular work, 
whenever the nature of it admits of such improvement. A great part of the machines made use of in those 
manufactures in which labor is most subdivided, were originally the invention of common workmen, who, 
being each of them employed in some very simple operation, naturally turned their thoughts towards 
finding out easier and readier methods of performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed to visit such 
manufactures, must frequently have been shewn very pretty machines, which were the inventions of such 
workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken their own particular part of the work. In the first fire engines 
{this was the current designation for steam engines}, a boy was constantly employed to open and shut 
alternately the communication between the boiler and the cylinder, according as the piston either ascended 
or descended. One of those boys, who loved to play with his companions, observed that, by tying a string 
from the handle of the valve which opened this communication to another part of the machine, the valve 
would open and shut without his assistance, and leave him at liberty to divert himself with his play-fellows. 
One of the greatest improvements that has been made upon this machine, since it was first invented, was in 
this manner the discovery of a boy who wanted to save his own labor. 

All the improvements in machinery, however, have by no means been the inventions of those who had 
occasion to use the machines. Many improvements have been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the 

machines, when to make them became the business of a peculiar trade; and some by that of those who are 
called philosophers, or men of speculation, whose trade it is not to do any thing, but to observe every thing, 
and who, upon that account, are often capable of combining together the powers of the most distant and 
dissimilar objects. in the progress of society, philosophy or speculation becomes, like every other 
employment, the principal or sole trade and occupation of a particular class of citizens. Like every other 
employment, too, it is subdivided into a great number of different branches, each of which affords 
occupation to a peculiar tribe or class of philosophers ; and this subdivision of employment in philosophy, 
as well as in every other business, improve dexterity, and saves time. Each individual becomes more expert 
in his own peculiar branch, more work is done upon the whole, and the quantity of science is considerably 
increased by it. 

It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of 
labor, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the 
lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what 
he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to 
exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or, what comes to the same thing, for the 
price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they 
accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all 
the different ranks of the society. 

Observe the accommodation of the most common artificer or daylaborer in a civilized and thriving 
country, and you will perceive that the number of people, of whose industry a part, though but a small part, 
has been employed in procuring him this accommodation, exceeds all computation. The woollen coat, for 
example, which covers the day-laborer, as coarse and rough as it may appear, is the produce of the joint 
labor of a great multitude of workmen. The shepherd, the sorter of the wool, the wool-comber or carder, 
the dyer, the scribbler, the spinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dresser, with many others, must all join their 
different arts in order to complete even this homely production. How many merchants and carriers, 
besides, must have been employed in transporting the materials from some of those workmen to others 
who often live in a very distant part of the country ? How much commerce and navigation in particular, 
how many ship-builders, sailors, sail-makers, rope-makers, must have been employed in order to bring 
together the different drugs made use of by the dyer, which often come from the remotest corners of the 
world ? What a variety of labor, too, is necessary in order to produce the tools of the meanest of those 
workmen ! To say nothing of such complicated machines as the ship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or 
even the loom of the weaver, let us consider only what a variety of labor is requisite in order to form that 
very simple machine, the shears with which the shepherd clips the wool. The miner, the builder of the 
furnace for smelting the ore the feller of the timber, the burner of the charcoal to be made use of in the 
smelting-house, the brickmaker, the bricklayer, the workmen who attend the furnace, the millwright, the 
forger, the smith, must all of them join their different arts in order to produce them. Were we to examine, 
in the same manner, all the different parts of his dress and household furniture, the coarse linen shirt which 
he wears next his skin, the shoes which cover his feet, the bed which he lies on, and all the different parts 
which compose it, the kitchen-grate at which he prepares his victuals, the coals which he makes use of for 
that purpose, dug from the bowels of the earth, and brought to him, perhaps, by a long sea and a long 
land-carriage, all the other utensils of his kitchen, all the furniture of his table, the knives and forks, the 
earthen or pewter plates upon which he serves up and divides his victuals, the different hands employed in 
preparing his bread and his beer, the glass window which lets in the heat and the light, and keeps out the 
wind and the rain, with all the knowledge and art requisite for preparing that beautiful and happy invention, 
without which these northern parts of the world could scarce have afforded a very comfortable habitation, 
together with the tools of all the different workmen employed in producing those different conveniencies ; 
if we examine, I say, all these things, and consider what a variety of labor is employed about each of them, 
we shall be sensible that, without the assistance and co-operation of many thousands, the very meanest 
person in a civilized country could not be provided, even according to, what we very falsely imagine, the 

easy and simple manner in which he is commonly accommodated. Compared, indeed, with the more  

extravagant luxury of the great, his accommodation must no doubt appear extremely simple and easy ; and  

yet it may be true, perhaps, that the accommodation of an European prince does not always so much  

exceed that of an industrious and frugal peasant, as the accommodation of the latter exceeds that of many

an African king, the absolute masters of the lives and liberties of ten thousand naked savages.

CHAPTER II.  

OF THE PRINCIPLE WHICH GIVES OCCASION TO THE DIVISION OF Labor.  


This division of labor, from which so many advantages are derived, is not originally the effect of any

human wisdom, which foresees and intends that general opulence to which it gives occasion. It is the  

necessary, though very slow and gradual, consequence of a certain propensity in human nature, which has  

in view no such extensive utility ; the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.  


Whether this propensity be one of those original principles in human nature, of which no further account  

can be given, or whether, as seems more probable, it be the necessary consequence of the faculties of  

reason and speech, it belongs not to our present subject to inquire. It is common to all men, and to be found  

in no other race of animals, which seem to know neither this nor any other species of contracts. Two  

greyhounds, in running down the same hare, have sometimes the appearance of acting in some sort of  

concert. Each turns her towards his companion, or endeavors to intercept her when his companion turns her  

towards himself. This, however, is not the effect of any contract, but of the accidental concurrence of their  

passions in the same object at that particular time. Nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate  

exchange of one bone for another with another dog. Nobody ever saw one animal, by its gestures and  

natural cries signify to another, this is mine, that yours ; I am willing to give this for that. When an animal  

wants to obtain something either of a man, or of another animal, it has no other means of persuasion, but to

gain the favour of those whose service it requires. A puppy fawns upon its dam, and a spaniel endeavors,  

by a thousand attractions, to engage the attention of its master who is at dinner, when it wants to be fed by

him. Man sometimes uses the same arts with his brethren, and when he has no other means of engaging

them to act according to his inclinations, endeavors by every servile and fawning attention to obtain their 

good will. He has not time, however, to do this upon every occasion. In civilized society he stands at all  

times in need of the co-operation and assistance of great multitudes, while his whole life is scarce  

sufficient to gain the friendship of a few persons. In almost every other race of animals, each individual,  

when it is grown up to maturity, is entirely independent, and in its natural state has occasion for the  

assistance of no other living creature. But man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren,  

and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can  

interest their self-love in his favour, and shew them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he  

requires of them. Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which  

I want, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer; and it is in this manner  

that we obtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is  

not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their  

regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never  

talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages. Nobody but a beggar chooses to depend  

chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow-citizens. Even a beggar does not depend upon it entirely. The  

charity of well-disposed people, indeed, supplies him with the whole fund of his subsistence. But though  

this principle ultimately provides him with all the necessaries of life which he has occasion for, it neither  

does nor can provide him with them as he has occasion for them. The greater part of his occasional wants

are supplied in the same manner as those of other people, by treaty, by barter, and by purchase. With the  

money which one man gives him he purchases food. The old clothes which another bestows upon him he  


exchanges for other clothes which suit him better, or for lodging, or for food, or for money, with which he 
can buy either food, clothes, or lodging, as he has occasion. 

As it is by treaty, by barter, and by purchase, that we obtain from one another the greater part of those 
mutual good offices which we stand in need of, so it is this same trucking disposition which originally 
gives occasion to the division of labor. In a tribe of hunters or shepherds, a particular person makes bows 
and arrows, for example, with more readiness and dexterity than any other. He frequently exchanges them 
for cattle or for venison, with his companions; and he finds at last that he can, in this manner, get more 
cattle and venison, than if he himself went to the field to catch them. From a regard to his own interest, 
therefore, the making of bows and arrows grows to be his chief business, and he becomes a sort of 
armourer. Another excels in making the frames and covers of their little huts or moveable houses. He is 
accustomed to be of use in this way to his neighbours, who reward him in the same manner with cattle and 
with venison, till at last he finds it his interest to dedicate himself entirely to this employment, and to 
become a sort of house-carpenter. In the same manner a third becomes a smith or a brazier; a fourth, a 
tanner or dresser of hides or skins, the principal part of the clothing of savages. And thus the certainty of 
being able to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labor, which is over and above his 
own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men's labor as he may have occasion for, 
encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation, and to cultivate and bring to perfection 
whatever talent of genius he may possess for that particular species of business. 

The difference of natural talents in different men, is, in reality, much less than we are aware of ; and the 
very different genius which appears to distinguish men of different professions, when grown up to 
maturity, is not upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division of labor. The 
difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a philosopher and a common street porter, for 
example, seems to arise not so much from nature, as from habit, custom, and education. When they came 
in to the world, and for the first six or eight years of their existence, they were, perhaps, very much alike, 
and neither their parents nor play-fellows could perceive any remarkable difference. About that age, or 
soon after, they come to be employed in very different occupations. The difference of talents comes then to 
be taken notice of, and widens by degrees, till at last the vanity of the philosopher is willing to 
acknowledge scarce any resemblance. But without the disposition to truck, barter, and exchange, every 
man must have procured to himself every necessary and conveniency of life which he wanted. All must 
have had the same duties to perform, and the same work to do, and there could have been no such 
difference of employment as could alone give occasion to any great difference of talents. 

As it is this disposition which forms that difference of talents, so remarkable among men of different 
professions, so it is this same disposition which renders that difference useful. Many tribes of animals, 
acknowledged to be all of the same species, derive from nature a much more remarkable distinction of 
genius, than what, antecedent to custom and education, appears to take place among men. By nature a 
philosopher is not in genius and disposition half so different from a street porter, as a mastiff is from a 
grey-hound, or a grey-hound from a spaniel, or this last from a shepherd's dog. Those different tribes of 
animals, however, though all of the same species are of scarce any use to one another. The strength of the 
mastiff is not in the least supported either by the swiftness of the greyhound, or by the sagacity of the 
spaniel, or by the docility of the shepherd's dog. The effects of those different geniuses and talents, for 
want of the power or disposition to barter and exchange, cannot be brought into a common stock, and do 
not in the least contribute to the better accommodation and conveniency of the species. Each animal is still 
obliged to support and defend itself, separately and independently, and derives no sort of advantage from 
that variety of talents with which nature has distinguished its fellows. Among men, on the contrary, the 
most dissimilar geniuses are of use to one another ; the different produces of their respective talents, by the 
general disposition to truck, barter, and exchange, being brought, as it were, into a common stock, where 
every man may purchase whatever part of the produce of other men's talents he has occasion for, 

 CHAPTER III. 

THAT THE DIVISION OF Labor IS LIMITED BY THE EXTENT OF THE MARKET. 

As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labor, so the extent of this division 
must always be limited by the extent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the market. When 
the market is very small, no person can have any encouragement to dedicate himself entirely to one 
employment, for want of the power to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labor, which 
is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men's labor as he has 
occasion for. 

There are some sorts of industry, even of the lowest kind, which can be carried on nowhere but in a great 
town. A porter, for example, can find employment and subsistence in no other place. A village is by much 
too narrow a sphere for him; even an ordinary market-town is scarce large enough to afford him constant 
occupation. In the lone houses and very small villages which are scattered about in so desert a country as 
the highlands of Scotland, every farmer must be butcher, baker, and brewer, for his own family. In such 
situations we can scarce expect to find even a smith, a carpenter, or a mason, within less than twenty miles 
of another of the same trade. The scattered families that live at eight or ten miles distance from the nearest 
of them, must learn to perform themselves a great number of little pieces of work, for which, in more 
populous countries, they would call in the assistance of those workmen. Country workmen are almost 
everywhere obliged to apply themselves to all the different branches of industry that have so much affinity 
to one another as to be employed about the same sort of materials. A country carpenter deals in every sort 
of work that is made of wood ; a country smith in every sort of work that is made of iron. The former is not 
only a carpenter, but a joiner, a cabinet-maker, and even a carver in wood, as well as a wheel-wright, a 
plough-wright, a cart and waggon-maker. The employments of the latter are still more various. It is 
impossible there should be such a trade as even that of a nailer in the remote and inland parts of the 
highlands of Scotland. Such a workman at the rate of a thousand nails a-day, and three hundred working 
days in the year, will make three hundred thousand nails in the year. But in such a situation it would be 
impossible to dispose of one thousand, that is, of one day's work in the year.  

As by means of water-carriage, a more extensive market is opened to every sort of industry than what 
land-carriage alone can afford it, so it is upon the sea-coast, and along the banks of navigable rivers, that 
industry of every kind naturally begins to subdivide and improve itself, and it is frequently not till a long 
time after that those improvements extend themselves to the inland parts of the country. . . . 

CHAPTER IV. 

OF THE ORIGIN AND USE OF MONEY. 

When the division of labor has been once thoroughly established, it is but a very small part of a man's 
wants which the produce of his own labor can supply. He supplies the far greater part of them by 
exchanging that surplus part of the produce of his own labor, which is over and above his own 
consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men's labor as he has occasion for. Every man thus 
lives by exchanging, or becomes, in some measure, a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is 
properly a commercial society. 

But when the division of labor first began to take place, this power of exchanging must frequently have 
been very much clogged and embarrassed in its operations. One man, we shall suppose, has more of a 
certain commodity than he himself has occasion for, while another has less. The former, consequently, 
would be glad to dispose of; and the latter to purchase, a part of this superfluity. But if this latter should 

chance to have nothing that the former stands in need of, no exchange can be made between them. The 
butcher has more meat in his shop than he himself can consume, and the brewer and the baker would each 
of them be willing to purchase a part of it. But they have nothing to offer in exchange, except the different 
productions of their respective trades, and the butcher is already provided with all the bread and beer which 
he has immediate occasion for. No exchange can, in this case, be made between them. He cannot be their 
merchant, nor they his customers ; and they are all of them thus mutually less serviceable to one another. In 
order to avoid the inconveniency of such situations, every prudent man in every period of society, after the 
first establishment of the division of labor, must naturally have endeavored to manage his affairs in such a 
manner, as to have at all times by him, besides the peculiar produce of his own industry, a certain quantity 
of some one commodity or other, such as he imagined few people would be likely to refuse in exchange for 
the produce of their industry. Many different commodities, it is probable, were successively both thought 
of and employed for this purpose. In the rude ages of society, cattle are said to have been the common 
instrument of commerce ; and, though they must have been a most inconvenient one, yet, in old times, we 
find things were frequently valued according to the number of cattle which had been given in exchange for 
them. The armour of Diomede, says Homer, cost only nine oxen; but that of Glaucus cost a hundred oxen. 
Salt is said to be the common instrument of commerce and exchanges in Abyssinia ; a species of shells in 
some parts of the coast of India ; dried cod at Newfoundland; tobacco in Virginia; sugar in some of our 
West India colonies; hides or dressed leather in some other countries; and there is at this day a village In 
Scotland, where it is not uncommon, I am told, for a workman to carry nails instead of money to the 
baker's shop or the ale-house. 

In all countries, however, men seem at last to have been determined by irresistible reasons to give the 
preference, for this employment, to metals above every other commodity. Metals can not only be kept with 
as little loss as any other commodity, scarce any thing being less perishable than they are, but they can 
likewise, without any loss, be divided into any number of parts, as by fusion those parts can easily be 
re-united again; a quality which no other equally durable commodities possess, and which, more than any 
other quality, renders them fit to be the instruments of commerce and circulation. The man who wanted to 
buy salt, for example, and had nothing but cattle to give in exchange for it, must have been obliged to buy 
salt to the value of a whole ox, or a whole sheep, at a time. He could seldom buy less than this, because 
what he was to give for it could seldom be divided without loss; and if he had a mind to buy more, he must, 
for the same reasons, have been obliged to buy double or triple the quantity, the value, to wit, of two or 
three oxen, or of two or three sheep. If, on the contrary, instead of sheep or oxen, he had metals to give in 
exchange for it, he could easily proportion the quantity of the metal to the precise quantity of the 
commodity which he had immediate occasion for. . . . 

What are the rules which men naturally observe, in exchanging them either for money, or for one another, I 
shall now proceed to examine. These rules determine what may be called the relative or exchangeable 
value of goods. 

The word VALUE, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of 
some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that 
object conveys. The one may be called ' value in use ;' the other, 'value in exchange.' The things which 
have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange ; and, on the contrary, those 
which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful 
than water ; but it will purchase scarce any thing; scarce any thing can be had in exchange for it. A 
diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may 
frequently be had in exchange for it. 
In order to investigate the principles which regulate the exchangeable value of commodities, I shall 
endeavor to shew:  First, what is the real measure of this exchangeable value; or wherein consists the real 
price of all commodities.  Secondly, what are the different parts of which this real price is composed or 
made up.  And, lastly, what are the different circumstances which sometimes raise some or all of these 

different parts of price above, and sometimes sink them below, their natural or ordinary rate; or, what are 
the causes which sometimes hinder the market price, that is, the actual price of commodities, from 
coinciding exactly with what may be called their natural price. . . . 

CHAPTER V. 

OF THE REAL AND NOMINAL PRICE OF COMMODITIES, OR OF THEIR PRICE IN LABOR AND 
THEIR PRICE IN MONEY. 

Every man is rich or poor according to the degree in which he can afford to enjoy the necessaries, 
conveniencies, and amusements of human life. But after the division of labor has once thoroughly taken 
place, it is but a very small part of these with which a man's own labor can supply him. The far greater part 
of them he must derive from the labor of other people, and he must be rich or poor according to the 
quantity of that labor which he can command, or which he can afford to purchase. The value of any 
commodity, therefore, to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but 
to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labor which it enables him to purchase or 
command. Labor therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities. 

The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil 
and trouble of acquiring it. What every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it and who wants 
to dispose of it, or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and 
which it can impose upon other people. What is bought with money, or with goods, is purchased by labor, 
as much as what we acquire by the toil of our own body. That money, or those goods, indeed, save us this 
toil. They contain the value of a certain quantity of labor, which we exchange for what is supposed at the 
time to contain the value of an equal quantity. Labor was the first price, the original purchase money that 
was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by silver, but by labor, that all the wealth of the world was 
originally purchased; and its value, to those who possess it, and who want to exchange it for some new 
productions, is precisely equal to the quantity of' labor which it can enable them to purchase or command. 

Wealth, as Mr Hobbes says, is power. But the person who either acquires, or succeeds to a great fortune, 
does not necessarily acquire or succeed to any political power, either civil or military. His fortune may, 
perhaps, afford him the means of acquiring both; but the mere possession of that fortune does not 
necessarily convey to him either. The power which that possession immediately and directly conveys to 
him, is the power of purchasing a certain command over all the labor, or over all the produce of labor 
which is then in the market. His fortune is greater or less, precisely in proportion to the extent of this 
power, or to the quantity either of other men's labor, or, what is the same thing, of the produce of other 
men's labor, which it enables him to purchase or command. The exchangeable value of every thing must 
always be precisely equal to the extent of this power which it conveys to its owner. 

But though labor be the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities, it is not that by which 
their value is commonly estimated. It is often difficult to ascertain the proportion between two different 
quantities of labor. The time spent in two different sorts of work will not always alone determine this 
proportion. The different degrees of hardship endured, and of ingenuity exercised, must likewise be taken 
into account. There may be more labor in an hour's hard work, than in two hours easy business ; or in an 
hour's application to a trade which it cost ten years labor to learn, than in a month's industry, at an ordinary 
and obvious employment. But it is not easy to find any accurate measure either of hardship or ingenuity. In 
exchanging, indeed, the different productions of different sorts of labor for one another, some allowance is 
commonly made for both. It is adjusted, however, not by any accurate measure, but by the higgling and 
bargaining of the market, according to that sort of rough equality which, though not exact, is sufficient for 
carrying on the business of common life. 

Every commodity, besides, Is more frequently exchanged for, and thereby compared with, other 
commodities, than with labor. It is more natural, therefore, to estimate its exchangeable value by the 
quantity of some other commodity, than by that of the labor which it can produce. The greater part of 
people, too, understand better what is meant by a quantity of a particular commodity, than by a quantity of 
labor. The one is a plain palpable object ; the other an abstract notion, which though it can be made 
sufficiently intelligible, is not altogether so natural and obvious. 

But when barter ceases, and money has become the common instrument of commerce, every particular 
commodity is more frequently exchanged for money than for any other commodity. The butcher seldom 
carries his beef or his mutton to the baker or the brewer, in order to exchange them for bread or for beer ; 
but he carries them to the market, where he exchanges them for money, and afterwards exchanges that 
money for bread and for beer. The quantity of money which he gets for them regulates, too, the quantity of 
bread and beer which he can afterwards purchase. It is more natural and obvious to him, therefore, to 
estimate their value by the quantity of money, the commodity for which he immediately exchanges them, 
than by that of bread and beer, the commodities for which he can exchange them only by the intervention 
of another commodity ; and rather to say that his butcher's meat is worth three-pence or fourpence a-pound, 
than that it is worth three or four pounds of bread, or three or four quarts of small beer. Hence it comes to 
pass, that the exchangeable value of every commodity is more frequently estimated by the quantity of 
money, than by the quantity either of labor or of any other commodity which can be had in exchange for it. 

Gold and silver, however, like every other commodity, vary in their value; are sometimes cheaper and 
sometimes dearer, sometimes of easier and sometimes of more difficult purchase. The quantity of labor 
which any particular quantity of them can purchase or command, or the quantity of other goods which it 
will exchange for, depends always upon the fertility or barrenness of the mines which happen to be known 
about the time when such exchanges are made. The discovery of the abundant mines of America, reduced, 
in the sixteenth century, the value of gold and silver in Europe to about a third of what it had been before. 
As it cost less labor to bring those metals from the mine to the market, so, when they were brought thither, 
they could purchase or command less labor; and this revolution in their value, though perhaps the greatest, 
is by no means the only one of which history gives some account. But as a measure of quantity, such as the 
natural foot, fathom, or handful, which is continually varying in its own quantity, can never be an accurate 
measure of the quantity of other things ; so a commodity which is itself continually varying in its own 
value, can never be an accurate measure of the value of other commodities. Equal quantities of labor, at all 
times and places, may be said to be of equal value to the laborer. In his ordinary state of health, strength, 
and spirits ; in the ordinary degree of his skill and dexterity, he must always lay down the same portion of 
his ease, his liberty, and his happiness. The price which he pays must always be the same, whatever may be 
the quantity of goods which he receives in return for it. Of these, indeed, it may sometimes purchase a 
greater and sometimes a smaller quantity ; but it is their value which varies, not that of the labor which 
purchases them. At all times and places, that is dear which it is difficult to come at, or which it costs much 
labor to acquire; and that cheap which is to be had easily, or with very little labor. Labor alone, therefore, 
never varying in its own value, is alone the ultimate and real standard by which the value of all 
commodities can at all times and places be estimated and compared. It is their real price; money is their 
nominal price only. 

But though equal quantities of labor are always of equal value to the laborer, yet to the person who 
employs him they appear sometimes to be of greater, and sometimes of smaller value. He purchases them 
sometimes with a greater, and sometimes with a smaller quantity of goods, and to him the price of labor 
seems to vary like that of all other things. It appears to him dear in the one case, and cheap in the other. In 
reality, however, it is the goods which are cheap in the one case, and dear in the other. 

In this popular sense, therefore, labor, like commodities, may be said to have a real and a nominal price. Its 
real price may be said to consist in the quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of life which are 

given for it ; its nominal price, in the quantity of money. The laborer is rich or poor, is well or ill rewarded, 
in proportion to the real, not to the nominal price of his labor. 

The distinction between the real and the nominal price of commodities and labor is not a matter of mere 
speculation, but may sometimes be of considerable use in practice. The same real price is always of the 
same value; but on account of the variations in the value of gold and silver, the same nominal price is 
sometimes of very different values. When a landed estate, therefore, is sold with a reservation of a 
perpetual rent, if it is intended that this rent should always be of the same value, it is of importance to the 
family in whose favour it is reserved, that it should not consist in a particular sum of money. Its value 
would in this case be liable to variations of two different kinds: first, to those which arise from the different 
quantities of gold and silver which are contained at different times in coin of the same denomination; and, 
secondly, to those which arise from the different values of equal quantities of gold and silver at different 
times. 

Princes and sovereign states have frequently fancied that they had a temporary interest to diminish the 
quantity of pure metal contained in their coins; but they seldom have fancied that they had any to augment 
it. The quantity of metal contained in the coins, I believe of all nations, has accordingly been almost 
continually diminishing, and hardly ever augmenting. Such variations, therefore, tend almost always to 
diminish the value of a money rent. 

The discovery of the mines of America diminished the value of gold and silver in Europe. This diminution, 
it is commonly supposed, though I apprehend without any certain proof, is still going on gradually, and is 
likely to continue to do so for a long time. Upon this supposition, therefore, such variations are more likely 
to diminish than to augment the value of a money rent, even though it should be stipulated to be paid, not 
in such a quantity of coined money of such a denomination (in so many pounds sterling, for example), but 
in so many ounces, either of pure silver, or of silver of a certain standard. . . . 

Equal quantities of labor will, at distant times, be purchased more nearly with equal quantities of corn, the 
subsistence of the laborer, than with equal quantities of gold and silver, or, perhaps, of any other 
commodity. Equal quantities of corn, therefore, will, at distant times, be more nearly of the same real 
value, or enable the possessor to purchase or command more nearly the same quantity of the labor of other 
people. They will do this, I say, more nearly than equal quantities of almost any other commodity; for even 
equal quantities of corn will not do it exactly. The subsistence of the laborer, or the real price of labor, as I 
shall endeavor to shew hereafter, is very different upon different occasions ; more liberal in a society 
advancing to opulence, than in one that is standing still, and in one that is standing still, than in one that is 
going backwards. Every other commodity, however, will, at any particular time, purchase a greater or 
smaller quantity of labor, in proportion to the quantity of subsistence which it can purchase at that time. . . . 
The money price of labor, as I shall endeavor to shew hereafter, does not fluctuate from year to year with 
the money price of corn, but seems to be everywhere accommodated, not to the temporary or occasional, 
but to the average or ordinary price of that necessary of life. The average or ordinary price of corn, again is 
regulated, as I shall likewise endeavor to shew hereafter, by the value of silver, by the richness or 
barrenness of the mines which supply the market with that metal, or by the quantity of labor which must be 
employed, and consequently of corn which must be consumed, in order to bring any particular quantity of 
silver from the mine to the market. But the value of silver, though it sometimes varies greatly from century 
to century, seldom varies much from year to year, but frequently continues the same, or very nearly the 
same, for half a century or a century together. The ordinary or average money price of corn, therefore, 
may, during so long a period, continue the same, or very nearly the same, too, and along with it the money 
price of labor, provided, at least, the society continues, in other respects, in the same, or nearly in the same, 
condition. In the mean time, the temporary and occasional price of corn may frequently be double one year 
of what it had been the year before, or fluctuate, for example, from five-and-twenty to fifty shillings the 
quarter. But when corn is at the latter price, not only the nominal, but the real value of a corn rent, will be 

double of what it is when at the former, or will command double the quantity either of labor, or of the 
greater part of other commodities; the money price of labor, and along with it that of most other things, 
continuing the same during all these fluctuations. 

Labor, therefore, it appears evidently, is the only universal, as well as the only accurate, measure of value, 
or the only standard by which we can compare the values of different commodities, at all times, and at all 
places. We cannot estimate, it is allowed, the real value of different commodities from century to century 
by the quantities of silver which were given for them. We cannot estimate it from year to year by the 
quantities of corn. By the quantities of labor, we can, with the greatest accuracy, estimate it, both from 
century to century, and from year to year. From century to century, corn is a better measure than silver, 
because, from century to century, equal quantities of corn will command the same quantity of labor more 
nearly than equal quantities of silver. From year to year, on the contrary, silver is a better measure than 
corn, because equal quantities of it will more nearly command the same quantity of labor. 

But though, in establishing perpetual rents, or even in letting very long leases, it may be of use to 
distinguish between real and nominal price; it is of none in buying and selling, the more common and 
ordinary transactions. of human life. 

At the same time and place, the real and the nominal price of all commodities are exactly in proportion to 
one another. The more or less money you get for any commodity, in the London market, for example, the 
more or less labor it will at that time and place enable you to purchase or command. At the same time and 
place, therefore, money is the exact measure of the real exchangeable value of all commodities. It is so, 
however, at the same time and place only. 

Though at distant places there is no regular proportion between the real and the money price of 
commodities, yet the merchant who carries goods from the one to the other, has nothing to consider but the 
money price, or the difference between the quantity of silver for which he buys them, and that for which he 
is likely to sell them. Half an ounce of silver at Canton in China may command a greater quantity both of 
labor and of the necessaries and conveniencies of life, than an ounce at London. A commodity, therefore, 
which sells for half an ounce of silver at Canton, may there be really dearer, of more real importance to the 
man who possesses it there, than a commodity which sells for an ounce at London is to the man who 
possesses it at London. If a London merchant, however, can buy at Canton, for half an ounce of silver a 
commodity which he can afterwards sell at London for an ounce, he gains a hundred per cent. by the 
bargain, just as much as if an ounce of silver was at London exactly of the same value as at Canton. It is of 
no importance to him that half an ounce of silver at Canton would have given him the command of more 
labor, and of a greater quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of life than an ounce can do at 
London. An ounce at London will always give him the command of double the quantity of all these, which 
half an ounce could have done there, and this is precisely what he wants. 

As it is the nominal or money price of goods, therefore, which finally determines the prudence or 
imprudence of all purchases and sales, and thereby regulates almost the whole business of common life in 
which price is concerned, we cannot wonder that it should have been so much more attended to than the 
real price. . . . 

CHAPTER VI. 

OF THE COMPONENT PART OF THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES. 

In that early and rude state of society which precedes both the accumulation of stock and the appropriation 
of land, the proportion between the quantities of labor necessary for acquiring different objects, seems to 
be the only circumstance which can afford any rule for exchanging them for one another. If among a nation 

of hunters, for example, it usually costs twice the labor to kill a beaver which it does to kill a deer, one 
beaver should naturally exchange for or be worth two deer. It is natural that what is usually the produce of 
two days or two hours labor, should be worth double of what is usually the produce of one day's or one 
hour's labor. 

If the one species of labor should be more severe than the other, some allowance will naturally be made for 
this superior hardship; and the produce of one hour's labor in the one way may frequently exchange for that 
of two hour's labor in the other. 

Or if the one species of labor requires an uncommon degree of dexterity and ingenuity, the esteem which 
men have for such talents, will naturally give a value to their produce, superior to what would be due to the 
time employed about it. Such talents can seldom be acquired but in consequence of long application, and 
the superior value of their produce may frequently be no more than a reasonable compensation for the time 
and labor which must be spent in acquiring them. In the advanced state of society, allowances of this kind, 
for superior hardship and superior skill, are commonly made in the wages of labor ; and something of the 
same kind must probably have taken place in its earliest and rudest period. 

In this state of things, the whole produce of labor belongs to the laborer; and the quantity of labor 
commonly employed in acquiring or producing any commodity, is the only circumstance which can 
regulate the quantity of labor which it ought commonly to purchase, command, or exchange for. 

As soon as stock has accumulated in the hands of particular persons, some of them will naturally employ it 
in setting to work industrious people, whom they will supply with materials and subsistence, in order to 
make a profit by the sale of their work, or by what their labor adds to the value of the materials. In 
exchanging the complete manufacture either for money, for labor, or for other goods, over and above what 
may be sufficient to pay the price of the materials, and the wages of the workmen, something must be 
given for the profits of the undertaker of the work, who hazards his stock in this adventure. The value 
which the workmen add to the materials, therefore, resolves itself in this case into two parts, of which the 
one pays their wages, the other the profits of their employer upon the whole stock of materials and wages 
which he advanced. He could have no interest to employ them, unless he expected from the sale of their 
work something more than what was sufficient to replace his stock to him ; and he could have no interest 
to employ a great stock rather than a small one, unless his profits were to bear some proportion to the 
extent of his stock. 

The profits of stock, it may perhaps be thought, are only a different name for the wages of a particular sort 
of labor, the labor of inspection and direction. They are, however, altogether different, are regulated by 
quite different principles, and bear no proportion to the quantity, the hardship, or the ingenuity of this 
supposed labor of inspection and direction. They are regulated altogether by the value of the stock 
employed, and are greater or smaller in proportion to the extent of this stock. Let us suppose, for example, 
that in some particular place, where the common annual profits of manufacturing stock are ten per cent. 
there are two different manufactures, in each of which twenty workmen are employed, at the rate of fifteen 
pounds a year each, or at the expense of three hundred a-year in each manufactory. Let us suppose, too, 
that the coarse materials annually wrought up in the one cost only seven hundred pounds, while the finer 
materials in the other cost seven thousand. The capital annually employed in the one will, in this case, 
amount only to one thousand pounds; whereas that employed in the other will amount to seven thousand 
three hundred pounds. At the rate of ten per cent. therefore, the undertaker of the one will expect a yearly 
profit of about one hundred pounds only; while that of the other will expect about seven hundred and thirty 
pounds. But though their profits are so very different, their labor of inspection and direction may be either 
altogether or very nearly the same. In many great works, almost the whole labor of this kind is committed 
to some principal clerk. His wages properly express the value of this labor of inspection and direction. 
Though in settling them some regard is had commonly, not only to his labor and skill, but to the trust 

which is reposed in him, yet they never bear any regular proportion to the capital of which he oversees the 
management ; and the owner of this capital, though he is thus discharged of almost all labor, still expects 
that his profit should bear a regular proportion to his capital. In the price of commodities, therefore, the 
profits of stock constitute a component part altogether different from the wages of labor, and regulated by 
quite different principles. 

In this state of things, the whole produce of labor does not always belong to the laborer. He must in most 
cases share it with the owner of the stock which employs him. Neither is the quantity of labor commonly 
employed in acquiring or producing any commodity, the only circumstance which can regulate the quantity 
which it ought commonly to purchase, command or exchange for. An additional quantity, it is evident, 
must be due for the profits of the stock which advanced the wages and furnished the materials of that labor. 

As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love 
to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest, 
the grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when land was in common, cost the 
laborer only the trouble of gathering them, come, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them. 
He must then pay for the licence to gather them, and must give up to the landlord a portion of what his 
labor either collects or produces. This portion, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, 
constitutes the rent of land, and in the price of the greater part of commodities, makes a third component 
part. 

The real value of all the different component parts of price, it must be observed, is measured by the 
quantity of labor which they can, each of them, purchase or command. Labor measures the value, not only 
of that part of price which resolves itself into labor, but of that which resolves itself into rent, and of that 
which resolves itself into profit. 

In every society, the price of every commodity finally resolves itself into some one or other, or all of those 
three parts ; and in every improved society, all the three enter, more or less, as component parts, into the 
price of the far greater part of commodities. 

In the price of corn, for example, one part pays the rent of the landlord, another pays the wages or 
maintenance of the laborers and laboring cattle employed in producing it, and the third pays the profit of 
the farmer. These three parts seem either immediately or ultimately to make up the whole price of corn. A 
fourth part, it may perhaps be thought is necessary for replacing the stock of the farmer, or for 
compensating the wear and tear of his laboring cattle, and other instruments of husbandry. But it must be 
considered, that the price of any instrument of husbandry, such as a laboring horse, is itself made up of the 
same time parts ; the rent of the land upon which he is reared, the labor of tending and rearing him, and the 
profits of the farmer, who advances both the rent of this land, and the wages of this labor. Though the price 
of the corn, therefore, may pay the price as well as the maintenance of the horse, the whole price still 
resolves itself, either immediately or ultimately, into the same three parts of rent, labor, and profit. 

In the price of flour or meal, we must add to the price of the corn, the profits of the miller, and the wages of 
his servants ; in the price of bread, the profits of the baker, and the wages of his servants; and in the price 
of both, the labor of transporting the corn from the house of the farmer to that of the miller, and from that 
of the miller to that of the baker, together with the profits of those who advance the wages of that labor. . . . 
But the whole price of any commodity must still finally resolve itself into some one or other or all of those 
three parts; as whatever part of it remains after paying the rent of the land, and the price of the whole labor 
employed in raising, manufacturing, and bringing it to market, must necessarily be profit to somebody. 

As the price or exchangeable value of every particular commodity, taken separately, resolves itself into 
some one or other, or all of those three parts ; so that of all the commodities which compose the whole 

annual produce of the labor of every country, taken complexly, must resolve itself into the same three 
parts, and be parcelled out among different inhabitants of the country, either as the wages of their labor, the 
profits of their stock, or the rent of their land. The whole of what is annually either collected or produced 
by the labor of every society, or, what comes to the same thing, the whole price of it, is in this manner 
originally distributed among some of its different members. Wages, profit, and rent, are the three original 
sources of all revenue, as well as of all exchangeable value. All other revenue is ultimately derived from 
some one or other of these. . . . 

As in a civilized country there are but few commodities of which the exchangeable value arises from labor 
only, rent and profit contributing largely to that of the far greater part of them, so the annual produce of its 
labor will always be sufficient to purchase or command a much greater quantity of labor than what was 
employed in raising, preparing, and bringing that produce to market. If the society were annually to employ 
all the labor which it can annually purchase, as the quantity of labor would increase greatly every year, so 
the produce of every succeeding year would be of vastly greater value than that of the foregoing. But there 
is no country in which the whole annual produce is employed in maintaining the industrious. The idle 
everywhere consume a great part of it; and, according to the different proportions in which it is annually 
divided between those two different orders of people, its ordinary or average value must either annually 
increase or diminish, or continue the same from one year to another. 

 CHAPTER VII. 

OF THE NATURAL AND MARKET PRICE OF COMMODITIES. 
There is in every society or neighbourhood an ordinary or average rate, both of wages and profit, in every 
different employment of labor and stock. This rate is naturally regulated, as I shall shew hereafter, partly 
by the general circumstances of the society, their riches or poverty, their advancing, stationary, or declining 
condition, and partly by the particular nature of each employment. . . . These ordinary or average rates may 
be called the natural rates of wages, profit and rent, at the time and place in which they commonly prevail. 
When the price of any commodity is neither more nor less than what is sufficient to pay the rent of the 
land, the wages of the labor, and the profits of the stock employed in raising, preparing, and bringing it to 
market, according to their natural rates, the commodity is then sold for what may be called its natural price. 

The commodity is then sold precisely for what it is worth, or for what it really costs the person who brings 
it to market; for though, in common language, what is called the prime cost of any commodity does not 
comprehend the profit of the person who is to sell it again, yet, if he sells it at a price which does not allow 
him the ordinary rate of profit in his neighbourhood, he is evidently a loser by the trade; since, by 
employing his stock in some other way, he might have made that profit. His profit, besides, is his revenue, 
the proper fund of his subsistence. As, while he is preparing and bringing the goods to market, he advances 
to his workmen their wages, or their subsistence ; so he advances to himself, in the same manner, his own 
subsistence, which is generally suitable to the profit which he may reasonably expect from the sale of his 
goods. Unless they yield him this profit, therefore, they do not repay him what they may very properly be 
said to have really cost him. 

Though the price, therefore, which leaves him this profit, is not always the lowest at which a dealer may 
sometimes sell his goods, it is the lowest at which he is likely to sell them for any considerable time; at 
least where there is perfect liberty, or where he may change his trade as often as he pleases. 

The actual price at which any commodity is commonly sold, is called its market price. It may either be 
above, or below, or exactly the same with its natural price. 

The market price of every particular commodity is regulated by the proportion between the quantity which 
is actually brought to market, and the demand of those who are willing to pay the natural price of the 

commodity, or the whole value of the rent, labor, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it thither. 
Such people may be called the effectual demanders, and their demand the effectual demand; since it maybe 
sufficient to effectuate the bringing of the commodity to market. It is different from the absolute demand. 
A very poor man may be said, in some sense, to have a demand for a coach and six; he might like to have 
it; but his demand is not an effectual demand, as the commodity can never be brought to market in order to 
satisfy it. 

When the quantity of any commodity which is brought to market falls short of the effectual demand, all 
those who are willing to pay the whole value of the rent, wages, and profit, which must be paid in order to 
bring it thither, cannot be supplied with the quantity which they want. Rather than want it altogether, some 
of them will be willing to give more. A competition will immediately begin among them, and the market 
price will rise more or less above the natural price, according as either the greatness of the deficiency, or 
the wealth and wanton luxury of the competitors, happen to animate more or less the eagerness of the 
competition. Among competitors of equal wealth and luxury, the same deficiency will generally occasion a 
more or less eager competition, according as the acquisition of the commodity happens to be of more or 
less importance to them. Hence the exorbitant price of the necessaries of life during the blockade of a 
town, or in a famine. 

When the quantity brought to market exceeds the effectual demand, it cannot be all sold to those who are 
willing to pay the whole value of the rent, wages, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it thither. 
Some part must be sold to those who are willing to pay less, and the low price which they give for it must 
reduce the price of the whole. The market price will sink more or less below the natural price, according as 
the greatness of the excess increases more or less the competition of the sellers, or according as it happens 
to be more or less important to them to get immediately rid of the commodity. The same excess in the 
importation of perishable, will occasion a much greater competition than in that of durable commodities; in 
the importation of oranges, for example, than in that of old iron. 

When the quantity brought to market is just sufficient to supply the effectual demand, and no more, the 
market price naturally comes to be either exactly, or as nearly as can be judged of, the same with the 
natural price. The whole quantity upon hand can be disposed of for this price, and can not be disposed of 
for more. The competition of the different dealers obliges them all to accept of this price, but does not 
oblige them to accept of less. 

The quantity of every commodity brought to market naturally suits itself to the effectual demand. It is the 
interest of all those who employ their land, labor, or stock, in bringing any commodity to market, that the 
quantity never should exceed the effectual demand ; and it is the interest of all other people that it never 
should fall short of that demand. 

If at any time it exceeds the effectual demand, some of the component parts of its price must be paid below 
their natural rate. If it is rent, the interest of the landlords will immediately prompt them to withdraw a part 
of their land; and if it is wages or profit, the interest of the laborers in the one case, and of their employers 
in the other, will prompt them to withdraw a part of their labor or stock, from this employment. The 
quantity brought to market will soon be no more than sufficient to supply the effectual demand. All the 
different parts of its price will rise to their natural rate, and the whole price to its natural price. 

If, on the contrary, the quantity brought to market should at any time fall short of the effectual demand, 
some of the component parts of its price must rise above their natural rate. If it is rent, the interest of all 
other landlords will naturally prompt them to prepare more land for the raising of this commodity ; if it is 
wages or profit, the interest of all other laborers and dealers will soon prompt them to employ more labor 
and stock in preparing and bringing it to market. The quantity brought thither will soon be sufficient to 

supply the effectual demand. All the different parts of its price will soon sink to their natural rate, and the 
whole price to its natural price. 

The natural price, therefore, is, as it were, the central price, to which the prices of all commodities are 
continually gravitating. Different accidents may sometimes keep them suspended a good deal above it, and 
sometimes force them down even somewhat below it. But whatever may be the obstacles which hinder 
them from settling in this centre of repose and continuance, they are constantly tending towards it. 

The whole quantity of industry annually employed in order to bring any commodity to market, naturally 
suits itself in this manner to the effectual demand. It naturally aims at bringing always that precise quantity 
thither which may be sufficient to supply, and no more than supply, that demand. 

But, in some employments, the same quantity of industry will, in different years, produce very different 
quantities of commodities ; while, in others, it will produce always the same, or very nearly the same. The 
same number of laborers in husbandry will, in different years, produce very different quantities of corn, 
wine, oil, hops, etc. But the same number of spinners or weavers will every year produce the same, or very 
nearly the same, quantity of linen and woollen cloth. It is only the average produce of the one species of 
industry [e.g., agriculture] which can be suited, in any respect, to the effectual demand ; and as its actual 
produce is frequently much greater, and frequently much less, than its average produce, the quantity of the 
commodities brought to market will sometimes exceed a good deal, and sometimes fall short a good deal, 
of the effectual demand. Even though that demand, therefore, should continue always the same, their 
market price will be liable to great fluctuations, will sometimes fall a good deal below, and sometimes rise 
a good deal above, their natural price. In the other species of industry, the produce of equal quantities of 
labor being always the same, or very nearly the same, it can be more exactly suited to the effectual 
demand. While that demand continues the same, therefore, the market price of the commodities is likely to 
do so too, and to be either altogether, or as nearly as can be judged of, the same with the natural price. That 
the price of linen and woollen cloth is liable neither to such frequent, nor to such great variations, as the 
price of corn, every man's experience will inform him. The price of the one species of commodities varies 
only with the variations in the demand; that of the other varies not only with the variations in the demand, 
but with the much greater, and more frequent, variations in the quantity of what is brought to market, in 
order to supply that demand. 

The occasional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of any commodity fall chiefly upon those 
parts of its price which resolve themselves into wages and profit. That part which resolves itself into rent is 
less affected by them. . . . Some natural productions require such a singularity of soil and situation, that all 
the land in a great country, which is fit for producing them, may not be sufficient to supply the effectual 
demand. The whole quantity brought to market, therefore, may be disposed of to those who are willing to 
give more than what is sufficient to pay the rent of the land which produced them, together with the wages 
of the labor and the profits of the stock which were employed in preparing and bringing them to market, 
according to their natural rates. Such commodities may continue for whole centuries together to be sold at 
this high price ; and that part of it which resolves itself into the rent of land, is in this case the part which is 
generally paid above its natural rate. The rent of the land which affords such singular and esteemed 
productions, like the rent of some vineyards in France of a peculiarly happy soil and situation, bears no 
regular proportion to the rent of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated land in its neighbourhood. 
The wages of the labor, and the profits of the stock employed in bringing such commodities to market, on 
the contrary, are seldom out of their natural proportion to those of the other employments of labor and 
stock in their neighbourhood. Such enhancements of the market price are evidently the effect of natural 
causes, which may hinder the effectual demand from ever being fully supplied, and which may continue, 
therefore, to operate for ever. . . . 

Though pecuniary wages and profit are very different in the different employments of labor and stock ; yet 
a certain proportion seems commonly to take place between both the pecuniary wages in all the different 
employments of labor, and the pecuniary profits in all the different employments of stock. This proportion, 
it will appear hereafter, depends partly upon the nature of the different employments, and partly upon the 
different laws and policy of the society in which they are carried on. But though in many respects 
dependent upon the laws and policy, this proportion seems to be little affected by the riches or poverty of 
that society, by its advancing, stationary, or declining condition, but to remain the same, or very nearly the 
same, in all those different states. I shall, in the third place, endeavor to explain all the different 
circumstances which regulate this proportion. . . . 

 CHAPTER VIII. 

OF THE WAGES OF LABOR. 

The produce of labor constitutes the natural recompence or wages of labor. 

In that original state of things which precedes both the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock, 
the whole produce of labor belongs to the laborer. He has neither landlord nor master to share with him. 

Had this state continued, the wages of labor would have augmented with all those improvements in its 
productive powers, to which the division of labor gives occasion. All things would gradually have become 
cheaper. They would have been produced by a smaller quantity of labor ; and as the commodities produced 
by equal quantities of labor would naturally in this state of things be exchanged for one another, they 
would have been purchased likewise with the produce of a smaller quantity. 

But though all things would have become cheaper in reality, in appearance many things might have 
become dearer, than before, or have been exchanged for a greater quantity of other goods. Let us suppose, 
for example, that in the greater part of employments the productive powers of labor had been improved to 
tenfold, or that a day's labor could produce ten times the quantity of work which it had done originally ; but 
that in a particular employment they had been improved only to double, or that a day's labor could produce 
only twice the quantity of work which it had done before. In exchanging the produce of a day's labor in the 
greater part of employments for that of a day's labor in this particular one, ten times the original quantity of 
work in them would purchase only twice the original quantity in it. Any particular quantity in it, therefore, 
a pound weight, for example, would appear to be five times dearer than before. In reality, however, it 
would be twice as cheap. Though it required five times the quantity of other goods to purchase it, it would 
require only half the quantity of labor either to purchase or to produce it. The acquisition, therefore, would 
be twice as easy as before. 

But this original state of things, in which the laborer enjoyed the whole produce of his own labor, could not 
last beyond the first introduction of the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock. It was at an 
end, therefore, long before the most considerable improvements were made in the productive powers of 
labor ; and it would be to no purpose to trace further what might have been its effects upon the recompence 
or wages of labor. 

As soon as land becomes private property, the landlord demands a share of almost all the produce which 
the laborer can either raise or collect from it. His rent makes the first deduction from the produce of the 
labor which is employed upon land. 

It seldom happens that the person who tills the ground has wherewithal to maintain himself till he reaps the 
harvest. His maintenance is generally advanced to him from the stock of a master, the farmer who employs 
him, and who would have no interest to employ him, unless he was to share in the produce of his labor, or 

unless his stock was to be replaced to him with a profit. This profit makes a second deduction from the 
produce of the labor which is employed upon land. 

The produce of almost all other labor is liable to the like deduction of profit. In all arts and manufactures, 
the greater part of the workmen stand in need of a master, to advance them the materials of their work, and 
their wages and maintenance, till it be completed. He shares in the produce of their labor, or in the value 
which it adds to the materials upon which it is bestowed; and in this share consists his profit. 

It sometimes happens, indeed, that a single independent workman has stock sufficient both to purchase the 
materials of his work, and to maintain himself till it be completed. He is both master and workman, and 
enjoys the whole produce of his own labor, or the whole value which it adds to the materials upon which it 
is bestowed. It includes what are usually two distinct revenues, belonging to two distinct persons, the 
profits of stock, and the wages of labor. 

Such cases, however, are not very frequent; and in every part of Europe twenty workmen serve under a 
master for one that is independent, and the wages of labor are everywhere understood to be, what they 
usually are, when the laborer is one person, and the owner of the stock which employs him another.  
What are the common wages of labor, depends everywhere upon the contract usually made between those 
two parties, whose interests are by no means the same. The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to 
give as little, as possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to raise, the latter in order to lower, 
the wages of labor. 

It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the 
advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms. . . . Masters are always and 
everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform, combination, not to raise the wages of labor above 
their actual rate. To violate this combination is everywhere a most unpopular action, and a sort of reproach 
to a master among his neighbours and equals. . . . 

When an independent workman, such as a weaver or shoemaker, has got more stock than what is sufficient 
to purchase the materials of his own work, and to maintain himself till he can dispose of it, he naturally 
employs one or more journeymen with the surplus, in order to make a profit by their work. Increase this 
surplus, and he will naturally increase the number of his journeymen. The demand for those who live by 
wages, therefore, necessarily increases with the increase of the revenue and stock of every country, and 
cannot possibly increase without it. The increase of revenue and stock is the increase of national wealth. 
The demand for those who live by wages, therefore, naturally increases with the increase of national 
wealth, and cannot possibly increase without it. 

It is not the actual greatness of national wealth, but its continual increase, which occasions a rise in the 
wages of labor. It is not, accordingly, in the richest countries, but in the most thriving, or in those which are 
growing rich the fastest, that the wages of labor are highest. . . . Though the wealth of a country should be 
very great, yet if it has been long stationary, we must not expect to find the wages of labor very high in it. 
The funds destined for the payment of wages, the revenue and stock of its inhabitants, may be of the 
greatest extent; but if they have continued for several centuries of the same, or very nearly of the same 
extent, the number of laborers employed every year could easily supply, and even more than supply, the 
number wanted the following year. There could seldom be any scarcity of hands, nor could the masters be 
obliged to bid against one another in order to get them. The hands, on the contrary, would, in this case, 
naturally multiply beyond their employment. There would be a constant scarcity of employment, and the 
laborers would be obliged to bid against one another in order to get it. If in such a country the wages off 
labor had ever been more than sufficient to maintain the laborer, and to enable him to bring up a family, 
the competition of the laborers and the interest of the masters would soon reduce them to the lowest rate 
which is consistent with common humanity. . . . But it would be otherwise in a country where the funds 

destined for the maintenance of labor were sensibly decaying. Every year the demand for servants and 
laborers would, in all the different classes of employments, be less than it had been the year before. Many 
who had been bred in the superior classes, not being able to find employment in their own business, would 
be glad to seek it in the lowest. The lowest class being not only overstocked with its own workmen, but 
with the overflowings of all the other classes, the competition for employment would be so great in it, as to 
reduce the wages of labor to the most miserable and scanty subsistence of the laborer. Many would not he 
able to find employment even upon these hard terms, but would either starve, or be driven to seek a 
subsistence, either by begging, or by the perpetration perhaps, of the greatest enormities. Want, famine, 
and mortality, would immediately prevail in that class, and from thence extend themselves to all the 
superior classes, till the number of inhabitants in the country was reduced to what could easily be 
maintained by the revenue and stock which remained in it, and which had escaped either the tyranny or 
calamity which had destroyed the rest. This, perhaps, is nearly the present state of Bengal, and of some 
other of the English settlements in the East Indies. In a fertile country, which had before been much 
depopulated, where subsistence, consequently, should not be very difficult, and where, notwithstanding, 
three or four hundred thousand people die of hunger in one year, we maybe assured that the funds destined 
for the maintenance of the laboring poor are fast decaying. The difference between the genius of the British 
constitution, which protects and governs North America, and that of the mercantile company which 
oppresses and domineers in the East Indies, cannot, perhaps, be better illustrated than by the different state 
of those countries. 

The liberal reward of labor, therefore, as it is the necessary effect, so it is the natural symptom of 
increasing national wealth. The scanty maintenance of the laboring poor, on the other hand, is the natural 
symptom that things are at a stand, and their starving condition, that they are going fast backwards. . . . 

The real recompence of labor, the real quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of life which it can 
procure to the laborer, has, during the course of the present century, increased perhaps in a still greater 
proportion than its money price. . . . Is this improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of the 
people to be regarded as an advantage, or as an inconveniency, to the society ? The answer seems at first 
abundantly plain. Servants, laborers, and workmen of different kinds, make up the far greater part of every 
great political society. But what improves the circumstances of the greater part, can never be regarded as 
any inconveniency to the whole. No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater 
part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, clothe, and lodge 
the whole body of the people, should have such a share of the produce of their own labor as to be 
themselves tolerably well fed, clothed, and lodged. 

Poverty, though it no doubt discourages, does not always prevent, marriage. It seems even to be favourable 
to generation. A half-starved Highland woman frequently bears more than twenty children, while a 
pampered fine lady is often incapable of bearing any, and is generally exhausted by two or three. 
Barrenness, so frequent among women of fashion, is very rare among those of inferior station. Luxury, in 
the fair sex, while it inflames, perhaps, the passion for enjoyment, seems always to weaken, and frequently 
to destroy altogether, the powers of generation. 

But poverty, though it does not prevent the generation, is extremely unfavourable to the rearing of children. 
The tender plant is produced ; but in so cold a soil, and so severe a climate, soon withers and dies. It is not 
uncommon, I have been frequently told, in the Highlands of Scotland, for a mother who has born twenty 
children not to have two alive. . . . Every species of animals naturally multiplies in proportion to the means 
of their subsistence, and no species can ever multiply be yond it. But in civilized society, it is only among 
the inferior ranks of people that the scantiness of subsistence can set limits to the further multiplication of 
the human species ; and it can do so in no other way than by destroying a great part of the children which 
their fruitful marriages produce. 

The liberal reward of labor, by enabling them to provide better for their children, and consequently to bring 
up a greater number, naturally tends to widen and extend those limits. It deserves to be remarked, too, that 
it necessarily does this as nearly as possible in the proportion which the demand for labor requires. If this 
demand is continually increasing, the reward of labor must necessarily encourage in such a manner the 
marriage and multiplication of laborers, as may enable them to supply that continually increasing demand 
by a continually increasing population. If the reward should at any time be less than what was requisite for 
this purpose, the deficiency of hands would soon raise it ; and if it should at any time be more, their 
excessive multiplication would soon lower it to this necessary rate. The market would be so much 
understocked with labor in the one case, and so much overstocked in the other, as would soon force back 
its price to that proper rate which the circumstances of the society required. It is in this manner that the 
demand for men, like that for any other commodity, necessarily regulates the production of men, quickens 
it when it goes on too slowly, and stops it when it advances too fast. It is this demand which regulates and 
determines the state of propagation in all the different countries of the world ; in North America, in 
Europe, and in China ; which renders it rapidly progressive in the first, slow and gradual in the second, and 
altogether stationary in the last. . . . 

Through the variations in the price of labor not only do not always correspond with those in the price of 
provisions, but are frequently quite opposite, we must not, upon this account, imagine that the price of 
provisions has no influence upon that of labor. . . . The scarcity of a dear year, by diminishing the demand 
for labor, tends to lower its price, as the high price of provisions tends to raise it. The plenty of a cheap 
year, on the contrary, by increasing the demand, tends to raise the price of labor, as the cheapness of 
provisions tends to lower it. In the ordinary variations of the prices of provisions, those two opposite 
causes seem to counterbalance one another, which is probably, in part, the reason why the wages of labor 
are everywhere so much more steady and permanent than the price of provisions. 

The increase in the wages of labor necessarily increases the price of many commodities, by increasing that 
part of it which resolves itself into wages, and so far tends to diminish their consumption, both at home and 
abroad. The same cause, however, which raises the wages of labor, the increase of stock, tends to increase 
its productive powers, and to make a smaller quantity of labor produce a greater quantity of work. The 
owner of the stock which employs a great number of laborers necessarily endeavors, for his own 
advantage, to make such a proper division and distribution of employment, that they may be enabled to 
produce the greatest quantity of work possible. For the same reason, he endeavors to supply them with the 
best machinery which either he or they can think of. What takes place among the laborers in a particular 
workhouse, takes place, for the same reason, among those of a great society. The greater their number, the 
more they naturally divide themselves into different classes and subdivisions of employments. More heads 
are occupied in inventing the most proper machinery for executing the work of each, and it is, therefore, 
more likely to be invented. There me many commodities, therefore, which, in consequence of these 
improvements, come to be produced by so much less labor than be. fore, that the increase of its price is 
more than compensated by the diminution of its quantity.

 CHAPTER IX. 

OF THE PROFITS OF STOCK. 

The rise and fall in the profits of stock depend upon the same causes with the rise and fall in the wages of 
labor, the increasing or declining state of the wealth of the society ; but those causes affect the one and the 
other very differently. 
The increase of stock, which raises wages, tends to lower profit. When the stocks of many rich merchants 
are turned into the same trade, their mutual competition naturally tends to lower its profit; and when there 
is a like increase of stock in all the different trades carried on in the same society, the same competition 
must produce the same effect in them all. 

It is not easy, it has already been observed, to ascertain what are the average wages of labor, even in a 
particular place, and at a particular time. We can, even in this case, seldom determine more than what are 
the most usual wages. But even this can seldom be done with regard to the profits of stock. Profit is so very 
fluctuating, that the person who carries on a particular trade, cannot always tell you himself what is the 
average of his annual profit. It is affected, not only by every variation of price in the commodities which he 
deals in, but by the good or bad fortune both of his rivals and of his customers, and by a thousand other 
accidents, to which goods, when carried either by sea or by land, or even when stored in a warehouse, are 
liable. It varies, therefore, not only from year to year, but from day to day, and almost from hour to hour. 
To ascertain what is the average profit of all the different trades carried on in a great kingdom, must be 
much more difficult; and to judge of what it may have been formerly, or in remote periods of time, with 
any degree of precision, must be altogether impossible. 

But though it may be impossible to determine, with any degree of precision, what are or were the average 
profits of stock, either in the present or in ancient times, some notion may be formed of them from the 
interest of money. It may be laid down as a maxim, that wherever a great deal can be made by the use of 
money, a great deal will commonly be given for the use of it; and that, wherever little can be made by it, 
less will commonly he given for it. Accordingly, therefore, as the usual market rate of interest varies in any 
country, we may be assured that the ordinary profits of stock must vary with it, must sink as it sinks, and 
rise as it rises. The progress of interest, therefore, may lead us to form some notion of the progress of 
profit. . . . 

In reality, high profits tend much more to raise the price of work than high wages. If, in the linen 
manufacture, for example, the wages of the different working people, the flax-dressers, the spinners, the 
weavers, etc. should all of them be advanced twopence a-day, it would be necessary to heighten the price 
of a piece of linen only by a number of twopences equal to the number of people that had been employed 
about it, multiplied by the number of days during which they had been so employed. That part of the price 
of the commodity which resolved itself into the wages, would, through all the different stages of the 
manufacture, rise only in arithmetical proportion to this rise of wages. But if the profits of all the different 
employers of those working people should be raised five per cent. that part of the price of the commodity 
which resolved itself into profit would, through all the different stages of the manufacture, rise in 
geometrical proportion to this rise of profit. The employer of the flax dressers would, in selling his flax, 
require an additional five per cent. upon the whole value of the materials and wages which he advanced to 
his workmen. The employer of the spinners would require an additional five per cent. both upon the 
advanced price of the flax, and upon the wages of the spinners. And the employer of the weavers would 
require alike five per cent. both upon the advanced price of the linen-yarn, and upon the wages of the 
weavers. In raising the price of commodities, the rise of wages operates in the same manner as simple 
interest does in the accumulation of debt. The rise of profit operates like compound interest. Our merchants 
and master manufacturers complain much of the bad effects of high wages in raising the price, and thereby 
lessening the sale of their goods, both at home and abroad. They say nothing concerning the bad effects of 
high profits ; they are silent with regard to the pernicious effects of their own gains; they complain only of 
those of other people. 

CHAPTER X. 

OF WAGES AND PROFIT IN THE DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENTS OF LABOR AND 
STOCK. 

The whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of labor and stock, 
must, in the same neighbourhood, be either perfectly equal, or continually tending to equality. If, 
in the same neighbourhood, there was any employment evidently either more or less 
advantageous than the rest, so many people would crowd into it in the one case, and so many 
would desert it in the other, that its advantages would soon return to the level of other 
employments. This, at least, would be the case in a society where things were left to follow their 
natural course, where there was perfect liberty, and where every man was perfectly free both to 
choose what occupation he thought proper, and to change it as often as he thought proper. Every 
man's interest would prompt him to seek the advantageous, and to shun the disadvantageous 
employment. . . . 

The property which every man has in his own labor, as it is the original foundation of all other 
property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable. The patrimony of a poor man lies in the strength 
and dexterity of his hands ; and to hinder him from employing this strength and dexterity in what 
manner he thinks proper, without injury to his neighbour. is a plain violation of this most sacred 
property. It is a manifest encroachment upon the just liberty, both of the workman, and of those 
who might be disposed to employ him. As it hinders the one from working at what he thinks 
proper, so it hinders the others from employing whom they think proper. To judge whether he is 
fit to be employed, may surely be trusted to the discretion of the employers, whose interest it so 
much concerns. . . . 

EXCERPT FROM BOOK IV, CHAPTER II. 

Every individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most advantageous employment 
for whatever capital he can command. It is his own advantage, indeed, and not that of the society, 
which he has in view. But the study of his own advantage naturally, or rather necessarily, leads 
him to prefer that employment which is most advantageous to the society. . . . 

[T]he annual revenue of every society is always precisely equal to the exchangeable value of the 
whole annual produce of its industry, or rather is precisely the same thing with that exchangeable 
value. As every individual, therefore, endeavors as much as he can, both to employ his capital in 
the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the 
greatest value; every individual necessarily labors to render the annual revenue of the society as 
great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows 
how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he 
intends only his own security ; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may 
be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led 
by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the 
worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest, he frequently 
promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have 
never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an 
affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed 
in dissuading them from it.
