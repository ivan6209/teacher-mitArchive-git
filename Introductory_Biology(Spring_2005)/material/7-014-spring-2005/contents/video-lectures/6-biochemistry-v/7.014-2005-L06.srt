1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
OK.  Today we're going to get into
some stuff where we're kind of

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:10
peering way back in evolution about
how life first learned to make

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:15
energy.  But before we do that I
just want to finish up talking a

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:20
little bit more about enzymes,
the biological catalysts that are

5
00:00:20 --> 00:00:25
critical for life to exist and about
how energy is stored.

6
00:00:25 --> 00:00:30
I want to clarify a point that
clearly confused a couple of you in

7
00:00:30 --> 00:00:35
the last lecture.
So the Gibbs free energy that we

8
00:00:35 --> 00:00:40
talked about can tell us that a
reaction could go and,

9
00:00:40 --> 00:00:45
in this case, would actually release
energy if it occurred,

10
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
if these reactants were converted to
these products.

11
00:00:49 --> 00:00:54
But the problem for most reactions
is that in order for the reaction to

12
00:00:54 --> 00:00:59
take place there's a state in the
middle, some chemical state known as

13
00:00:59 --> 00:01:04
the transition state which is
energetically less favorable than

14
00:01:04 --> 00:01:09
either the reactants
or the products.

15
00:01:09 --> 00:01:12
And if A and B are going to convert
to C and D they have to probably

16
00:01:12 --> 00:01:16
start coming together in some kind
of way, and that becomes

17
00:01:16 --> 00:01:20
energetically unfavorable.
And this gives this activation

18
00:01:20 --> 00:01:30
energy --

19
00:01:30 --> 00:01:34
-- or delta G00.
And if the cell wants chemical

20
00:01:34 --> 00:01:39
reactions to take place at 25
degrees Centigrade aqueous solution

21
00:01:39 --> 00:01:43
it has to do something about that,
and so it employs biological

22
00:01:43 --> 00:01:48
catalysts.  And what a catalyst does,
as you've heard in chemistry,

23
00:01:48 --> 00:01:53
is it lowers the activation energy
in some way so that the molecules

24
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
have enough energy just within their
normal energy distribution at that

25
00:01:57 --> 00:02:02
temperature to get over the hump.
These biological catalysts come in

26
00:02:02 --> 00:02:08
two flavors.  As I said there are
enzymes which are made of protein

27
00:02:08 --> 00:02:14
with all of those amino acids,
the side chains that we talked about

28
00:02:14 --> 00:02:20
when the thing folds up in
3-dimensional space form a little

29
00:02:20 --> 00:02:26
chemical environment that enables
that activation energy to be lowered.

30
00:02:26 --> 00:02:31
There are also few --
Not so many.  But we now know that

31
00:02:31 --> 00:02:36
there are catalysts made out of RNA.
These are called ribozymes.  There

32
00:02:36 --> 00:02:41
are not so many of them but they're
important.  Now,

33
00:02:41 --> 00:02:46
the characteristics of these that
are important is the specificity --

34
00:02:46 --> 00:03:03
Each enzyme or ribozyme is highly

35
00:03:03 --> 00:03:13
specific for a given reaction.
So that means the reaction probably

36
00:03:13 --> 00:03:18
will barely go unless that enzyme or,
in some cases,

37
00:03:18 --> 00:03:23
ribozyme is present.
And so that's really the secret to

38
00:03:23 --> 00:03:28
how cells control all of these many,
many, many hundreds or thousands of

39
00:03:28 --> 00:03:34
chemical reactions that take place
that are necessary for life.

40
00:03:34 --> 00:03:39
Because what they need to do,
and if they want to control whether

41
00:03:39 --> 00:03:45
reaction takes place or not is they
control the availability or the

42
00:03:45 --> 00:03:51
activity of an enzyme.
And when we talk about gene

43
00:03:51 --> 00:03:57
regulation you'll see,
for example, one way a cell might do

44
00:03:57 --> 00:04:03
it is to not even bother to make the
enzyme unless it wants a particular

45
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
reaction to take place.
Or it could take an enzyme that's

46
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
there and put little bells and
whistles on it that make it more

47
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
active or less active.
And we'll see an example of that

48
00:04:14 --> 00:04:17
pretty soon.  That is the secret to
how cells are then able to

49
00:04:17 --> 00:04:25
regulate metabolism.

50
00:04:25 --> 00:04:30
And these biological catalysts use a
whole variety of different molecular

51
00:04:30 --> 00:04:35
mechanisms, although all of them
follow this principle of what

52
00:04:35 --> 00:04:41
they're trying to do is lower the
activation energy.

53
00:04:41 --> 00:04:45
So I'll just give you an example.
I showed you of how one particular

54
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
enzyme does it just in sort of
cartoon form.  I gave you the

55
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
example of glutamate being converted
to glutamine.  Now,

56
00:04:53 --> 00:04:57
both of those are amino acids that
are critical for making proteins.

57
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
The cell has to make both of them.
But as I showed you converting

58
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
glutamate to glutamine is
energetically unfavorable.

59
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
It's got a delta G plus 7.
And then I showed you if you had an

60
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
ATP going to ADP at the same time
you could actually drive the whole

61
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
reaction forward because there was a
net gain.  But how is that actually

62
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
accomplished?  And it's the enzyme
that carries this out.

63
00:05:22 --> 00:05:26
And I'll just show you,
as I say, in sort of cartoon form.

64
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
The way the enzyme works it has one
binding pocket for glutamic

65
00:05:30 --> 00:05:35
acid or glutamate.
It fits in here.

66
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
It makes lots of specialized
contacts, all those sort of

67
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
molecular interactions we're talking
about.  And it also binds this

68
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
molecule adenine triphosphate or ATP
which is an adenine,

69
00:05:47 --> 00:05:51
a ribose and then three phosphates
joined together.

70
00:05:51 --> 00:05:55
And it makes interactions along
here that enable it to bind very

71
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
specifically.  Now,
by providing all this binding energy

72
00:05:59 --> 00:06:03
for ATP and for glutamic acid what
the enzyme has done is positioned

73
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
the carboxyl group of glutamic acid
right next to the last

74
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
phosphate on the ATP.
This enables this to form a bond

75
00:06:11 --> 00:06:16
here which liberates ADP and leaves
you now with the glutamic acid with

76
00:06:16 --> 00:06:21
a phosphate on.
That reaction goes forward because

77
00:06:21 --> 00:06:26
you broke the bond of ATP,
but this is still a pretty unhappy

78
00:06:26 --> 00:06:31
molecule.  It's got a lot of oxygens
at very close proximity.

79
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
So the enzyme has another binding
pocket that's absolutely specific

80
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
for ammonia.  It won't fit water
which is very close,

81
00:06:39 --> 00:06:44
which is a good thing because that
would just reverse the process.

82
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
Ammonia gets in there and then it
attacks here and liberates the

83
00:06:48 --> 00:06:53
phosphate.  And that then gives you
glutamine and the inorganic

84
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
phosphate.  So the enzyme has
provided this binding surface that

85
00:06:57 --> 00:07:02
makes the reactions go under
biological conditions.

86
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
But it's also managed in the same
process to have it go by a mechanism

87
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
in which it sort of temporarily
captured that energy that's in the

88
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
ATP bond and then used it to drive
the rest of the reaction.

89
00:07:14 --> 00:07:19
I mean it's the magic of how all of
this developed.

90
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
It's really amazing but that's how
every single biochemical step in

91
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
your body takes place.
Virtually of them require an enzyme

92
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
that in some way is highly tuned to
do just the one single reaction.

93
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
As I said, the principle of how
these enzymes work is they lower the

94
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
activation energy.
And the way they do that in general

95
00:07:40 --> 00:07:44
is they provide a binding pocket
that resembles the transition state.

96
00:07:44 --> 00:07:48
So as things approach here then it
fits best into the pocket and

97
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
therefore you get some energy back
and kind of lowered the energy hump

98
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
that's necessary to go over.
And here's a reaction I'll be

99
00:07:56 --> 00:08:00
showing you in today's lecture.
It's going to involve the transfer

100
00:08:00 --> 00:08:05
of a phosphate to a glucose.
And the first thing that happens is

101
00:08:05 --> 00:08:10
this enzyme interacts with ATP and
takes one of the phosphates and

102
00:08:10 --> 00:08:15
attaches it to one of its aspartic
acid carboxyl groups.

103
00:08:15 --> 00:08:20
So you've got actually a mixed in
hydride if you know chemistry.

104
00:08:20 --> 00:08:25
But again it's captured that
phosphate.  This is a very unstable

105
00:08:25 --> 00:08:30
bond.  And so if you break it you
will release energy.

106
00:08:30 --> 00:08:34
And what the enzyme does is it
allows the hydroxyl of here to come

107
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
and attack this phosphate,
and that then releases the aspartate

108
00:08:38 --> 00:08:42
of the enzyme and you end up
affecting the transfer of the

109
00:08:42 --> 00:08:46
phosphate that began life on ATP.
And now it ends up on the glucose.

110
00:08:46 --> 00:08:50
But, as you can see here, phosphate
interacts with four atoms.

111
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
But as this hydroxyl comes in it
has to attack the phosphate.

112
00:08:54 --> 00:08:58
And somewhere in the middle there's
an intermediate where all of these

113
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
things are interacting.
And some crystallographers actually

114
00:09:02 --> 00:09:06
managed to capture that in a crystal
structure.  And here you can see

115
00:09:06 --> 00:09:10
this is the oxygen coming from the
sugar, this is the oxygen of the

116
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
aspartate and here is the phosphate
where it's now,

117
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
as the attack is taking place the
thing is sort of pushed out,

118
00:09:17 --> 00:09:21
and it's caught right at that
transition state.

119
00:09:21 --> 00:09:25
And that's what the enzyme is
providing a binding pocket for and

120
00:09:25 --> 00:09:29
thereby lowering the activation
energy.  It's a really beautiful

121
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
piece of structural work.
The second thing then I want to

122
00:09:33 --> 00:09:38
clarify was this molecule ATP which
is, as I say, like energy money for

123
00:09:38 --> 00:09:42
the cell.  When there's a reaction
where it can extract energy it tries

124
00:09:42 --> 00:09:47
to make ATP.  And when there's a
reaction that doesn't want to go it

125
00:09:47 --> 00:09:52
will somehow figure out a way to
spend that energy and make the

126
00:09:52 --> 00:09:57
reaction go forward.
And the molecule, just to put it

127
00:09:57 --> 00:10:02
again, because it's a pretty
important one in biology.

128
00:10:02 --> 00:10:08
That's adenine which you already saw
when we talked about nucleic acids.

129
00:10:08 --> 00:10:14
And it's got three phosphates like
this.  You can see it's probably a

130
00:10:14 --> 00:10:20
pretty unhappy molecule because it's
got all of these oxygens stuck

131
00:10:20 --> 00:10:26
together.  And if you break this
bond then you release some energy.

132
00:10:26 --> 00:10:33
So you could think of it in this
kind of way.

133
00:10:33 --> 00:10:41
That if we have ADP,
which is adenosine diphosphate plus

134
00:10:41 --> 00:10:49
inorganic phosphate,
and ATP is here.  And if you were to

135
00:10:49 --> 00:10:57
break the bond and make it back into
ADP and inorganic phosphate then you

136
00:10:57 --> 00:11:05
would have gone energetically
downhill.

137
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
But in order to make this you could
think of it as taking an inorganic

138
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
phosphate ion and this ADP,
if you start pushing them together

139
00:11:13 --> 00:11:18
the negative charges are going to
repel and you kind of go up an

140
00:11:18 --> 00:11:22
energy hill.  But if you ever get
them close enough then they start to

141
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26
share electrons and they fall into
this sort of energy well.

142
00:11:26 --> 00:11:31
And this is what ATP is.
And so it's sort of like taking a

143
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
spring and pushing it together.
And then when you form the bond

144
00:11:35 --> 00:11:40
it's like you put a little hook on
it.  And now you've got this spring

145
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
that's compressed.
And it's stable, it won't do

146
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49
anything, but there's energy stored
in there that you can use.

147
00:11:49 --> 00:11:54
And it's the same principle in
terms of how the cell stores energy

148
00:11:54 --> 00:11:59
within ATP.  And this
energy is stored --

149
00:11:59 --> 00:12:06
-- if you think of it in bundles of

150
00:12:06 --> 00:12:11
about 12 kilocalories per mole.
That's about how much energy is

151
00:12:11 --> 00:12:17
released under physiological
conditions when you hydrolyze that

152
00:12:17 --> 00:12:22
bond.  So hydrolyzing ATP to give
ADP plus inorganic phosphate will

153
00:12:22 --> 00:12:27
have a delta G of minus 12
kilocalories per mole under

154
00:12:27 --> 00:12:32
physiological conditions.
Now something in terms of evolution,

155
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
which I know a number of you said
you were interested in,

156
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
here's a really interesting thing.
This is the main energy storage

157
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
molecule for the cell,
but you've heard about it before

158
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48
because adenosine,
that's the nucleotide that we find

159
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
in RNA.  And, in fact,
ATP is also the precursor,

160
00:12:52 --> 00:12:56
as we'll learn, for making RNA.
And one of the things that puzzled

161
00:12:56 --> 00:13:00
scientists for many years is how did
life ever get started

162
00:13:00 --> 00:13:04
in the first place?
There seemed to be a chicken and an

163
00:13:04 --> 00:13:08
egg issue that proteins did the work
and DNA stored the information and

164
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
RNA was kind of a messenger in
between, and we'll talk a lot about

165
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
that in between.
So how could you ever get life

166
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
started?  So the current thinking is
that sometime,

167
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
if you remember in that first
lecture, we had about 4.

168
00:13:22 --> 00:13:26
billion years ago the first
organism, something like today's

169
00:13:26 --> 00:13:30
bacterium showed up here about maybe
3.8 billion years ago.

170
00:13:30 --> 00:13:34
That somewhere in between there was
what people are now thinking of as

171
00:13:34 --> 00:13:38
an “RNA world” where RNA managed to
act as a ribosome and catalyzed

172
00:13:38 --> 00:13:42
chemical reactions,
but it also had the capacity to

173
00:13:42 --> 00:13:47
store information.
But it's sort of intriguing,

174
00:13:47 --> 00:13:51
although no one has proven that.
It's just a hypothesis.  We also

175
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
see that the major energy storage
molecule found in all living things

176
00:13:55 --> 00:13:59
is also a building block of RNA.
It certainly sort of fits with that

177
00:13:59 --> 00:14:03
kind of idea.
Now, there's one other kind of

178
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
reaction I'm going to have to tell
you about.  Penny will talk quite a

179
00:14:07 --> 00:14:11
bit about this when you're thinking
about how organisms make living.

180
00:14:11 --> 00:14:15
But this is a set of reactions
known as “redox reactions”.

181
00:14:15 --> 00:14:27
So the loss of one or more

182
00:14:27 --> 00:14:37
electron(s) is called an oxidation.
And the gain of one or more

183
00:14:37 --> 00:14:41
electron(s) is called a reduction.
If you're going to take away an

184
00:14:41 --> 00:14:46
electron somebody else has to get it.
So these things always happen

185
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
together.  And therefore they're
given the term redox reactions where

186
00:14:50 --> 00:14:55
electron(s) from somebody goes to
somebody else.

187
00:14:55 --> 00:14:59
So somebody gets oxidized and
somebody gets reduced in

188
00:14:59 --> 00:15:05
the same reaction.
And you can think of them as a

189
00:15:05 --> 00:15:11
transfer of hydrogen atoms,
not hydrogon ions.  And the most

190
00:15:11 --> 00:15:18
familiar kind of sequence that you
will see over and over again in

191
00:15:18 --> 00:15:24
biology is the sequence you go from,
let's say, a methyl group to an

192
00:15:24 --> 00:15:30
alcohol with a hydroxyl to an
aldehyde or a ketone with the double

193
00:15:30 --> 00:15:37
bond oxygen to a carboxyl group.
You go one more step then it's CO2.

194
00:15:37 --> 00:15:43
So going in this direction it's an
oxidation.  If it's going in that

195
00:15:43 --> 00:15:50
direction the molecules are getting
reduced.  Just the same way that the

196
00:15:50 --> 00:15:56
cell and life have molecules that
store energy in ATP,

197
00:15:56 --> 00:16:03
they also have an important molecule
that stores electrons.

198
00:16:03 --> 00:16:14
And that molecule is known as NAD or
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

199
00:16:14 --> 00:16:37
NAD+.  And its structure is,

200
00:16:37 --> 00:16:46
let's say a ribose, a five carbon
sugar.  And it's got this entity on

201
00:16:46 --> 00:16:55
it.  This is in your book so don't
worry if you don't get

202
00:16:55 --> 00:17:03
the structure down.
There's a positive charge on the

203
00:17:03 --> 00:17:11
nitrogen here.
And it's joined through a

204
00:17:11 --> 00:17:19
diphosphate linkage to,
guess what?  Another molecule of

205
00:17:19 --> 00:17:27
adenosine.  Here we find again a
piece of a thing we find in RNA is

206
00:17:27 --> 00:17:35
now part of this system
for storing electrons.

207
00:17:35 --> 00:17:45
And the way this works is if you
have two hydrogen atoms transferred

208
00:17:45 --> 00:17:55
to here then this entity right here
goes to this plus a hydrogen ion.

209
00:17:55 --> 00:18:02
And this we would know is NADH.
I left out an oxygen here.

210
00:18:02 --> 00:18:08
Somebody picked it up.  [LAUGHTER]
Just too excited by the annual

211
00:18:08 --> 00:18:14
Valentine's Day visit here.
I wish the rest of you had a song

212
00:18:14 --> 00:18:20
for you, too, but we didn't have
time to set that up.

213
00:18:20 --> 00:18:26
So there's an important thing here,
too, because actually a lot of

214
00:18:26 --> 00:18:32
energy is stored in there.
This is a bundle of energy in this

215
00:18:32 --> 00:18:38
molecule that's actually about 50
kilocalories per mole.

216
00:18:38 --> 00:18:43
And especially when we get to next
week's lecture you'll see how cells

217
00:18:43 --> 00:18:48
go about extracting the energy out
of that and making that energy into

218
00:18:48 --> 00:18:53
ATP, which is sort of a universal
currency the cells can spend.

219
00:18:53 --> 00:18:59
Now, somebody asked about
memorizing all of these structures

220
00:18:59 --> 00:19:02
I mean really,
As Julia says in her thing,

221
00:19:02 --> 00:19:05
we're trying to get you to focus on
the concepts here.

222
00:19:05 --> 00:19:09
You won't have to memorize the
structure of everything.

223
00:19:09 --> 00:19:12
It would be helpful if you
recognized that glutamine and

224
00:19:12 --> 00:19:15
glutamate are of the 20 amino acids,
but we'll give you the structures

225
00:19:15 --> 00:19:19
and we'll give you the structures of
something like NADH if you needed to

226
00:19:19 --> 00:19:22
do something with it.
But the important thing is to

227
00:19:22 --> 00:19:25
remember that energy is stored in
that high energy bond of ATP,

228
00:19:25 --> 00:19:29
that electrons are stored in this
NADH, and they can be used in

229
00:19:29 --> 00:19:33
reactions that oxidize or reduce.
NAD and NADH can be used in

230
00:19:33 --> 00:19:38
reactions that remove or give
electrons to biomolecules.

231
00:19:38 --> 00:19:44
Now, the same thing goes for what
I'm about to tell you now because

232
00:19:44 --> 00:19:49
one of the first things that had to
happen as life evolved was there had

233
00:19:49 --> 00:19:54
to be some mechanism of getting
energy made.  And the reaction I'm

234
00:19:54 --> 00:20:00
going to tell you about
is called glycolysis.

235
00:20:00 --> 00:20:07
And it's a way of taking a molecule
of glucose through a whole series of

236
00:20:07 --> 00:20:15
biochemical transformations and to
end up yielding --

237
00:20:15 --> 00:20:26
-- two molecules of something that's

238
00:20:26 --> 00:20:32
known as pyruvate.
And it also makes two molecules of

239
00:20:32 --> 00:20:37
ATP and two molecules of NADH.
So it's a way that was invented in

240
00:20:37 --> 00:20:42
evolution of making ATP by carrying
out a chemical transformation.

241
00:20:42 --> 00:20:48
And this is basically the same
chemical transformation that we've

242
00:20:48 --> 00:20:53
been talking about that Lavoisier
and Pasteur studied except that,

243
00:20:53 --> 00:20:58
as I'll show you, you do a little
bit to convert it either to lactate

244
00:20:58 --> 00:21:02
or to ethanol.
I'll get to that in a few minutes.

245
00:21:02 --> 00:21:06
Remember the point, also just to
remind you, the reason I gave you

246
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10
that historical thing is because
what it turned out when people

247
00:21:10 --> 00:21:14
started out to study something,
was winemaking of great interest to

248
00:21:14 --> 00:21:18
French scientists,
was what they actually learned was

249
00:21:18 --> 00:21:22
how cells made energy.
And, in fact, here we're looking at

250
00:21:22 --> 00:21:26
a sort of biochemical fossil in a
way because this pathway of

251
00:21:26 --> 00:21:30
glycolysis, which you'll
see is kind of awkward.

252
00:21:30 --> 00:21:35
It's got ten different biochemical
steps, it needs ten different

253
00:21:35 --> 00:21:40
enzymes, and what the cells got out
of it is two molecules of ATP.

254
00:21:40 --> 00:21:45
But this system developed
apparently way,

255
00:21:45 --> 00:21:50
way back in evolution before life
forms got into these various

256
00:21:50 --> 00:21:55
Kingdoms because it's in virtually
in every living creature no matter

257
00:21:55 --> 00:22:00
what it is and it's essentially
biochemically identical.

258
00:22:00 --> 00:22:03
Now, it's possible we could go back
nowadays and devise a better method,

259
00:22:03 --> 00:22:07
but once that something like that
gets fixed in evolution,

260
00:22:07 --> 00:22:10
if something mutates to try and
change it most of the time it's a

261
00:22:10 --> 00:22:14
disadvantage.  And so if something
gets locked in,

262
00:22:14 --> 00:22:17
and this is true of many,
many of these very complicated

263
00:22:17 --> 00:22:21
biochemical pathways.
So you won't have to remember all

264
00:22:21 --> 00:22:24
these structures I'm going to put on
the board, but try and stay with me

265
00:22:24 --> 00:22:28
because I want to sort of show you
one of these.  This is probably the

266
00:22:28 --> 00:22:31
most ancient of these pathways.
And it's still in all of us.

267
00:22:31 --> 00:22:35
It's in the bacteria in our guts.
It's in the plants in the field.

268
00:22:35 --> 00:22:39
If you go out in the open ocean
organisms still can carry out

269
00:22:39 --> 00:22:43
glycolysis.  So one thing,
though, I want to try and put it in

270
00:22:43 --> 00:22:46
this way, if I came to you and said
I've got the greatest idea.

271
00:22:46 --> 00:22:50
This is going to be how we're going
to make energy and evolution as part

272
00:22:50 --> 00:22:54
of this entrepreneurship,
I think you'd be right to be

273
00:22:54 --> 00:22:58
skeptical so I'll probably sort of
tell you in that way.

274
00:22:58 --> 00:23:02
So I've already shown you how to
write glucose in a linear form,

275
00:23:02 --> 00:23:07
although I then told you that most
of the time in solution it's

276
00:23:07 --> 00:23:12
cyclized into a pyranose ring,
a six membered ring.  But for the

277
00:23:12 --> 00:23:17
moment we can think of glucose as a
stick.  And I'll get you to just

278
00:23:17 --> 00:23:22
focus on the one position,
the two position and the six

279
00:23:22 --> 00:23:27
position in that linear thing.
If you look back at your notes you

280
00:23:27 --> 00:23:32
can see what the full structure of
glucose looks like.

281
00:23:32 --> 00:23:39
But this is how the process of
glycolysis starts.

282
00:23:39 --> 00:23:47
This is if your body is going to
take a molecule of glucose and make

283
00:23:47 --> 00:23:55
energy out of it,
this is the first thing it does.

284
00:23:55 --> 00:24:03
It takes an ATP.  It converts it to
an ADP.  It puts the phosphate down

285
00:24:03 --> 00:24:08
here to give glucose-6- phosphate.
That's the only thing that changes.

286
00:24:08 --> 00:24:11
Isn't this just like most young
entrepreneurs?

287
00:24:11 --> 00:24:14
Give them some venture capital.
The first thing they do is spend it,

288
00:24:14 --> 00:24:17
buy a nice potted plant for the
company they're building.

289
00:24:17 --> 00:24:21
It doesn't seem to be, if you want
to make energy,

290
00:24:21 --> 00:24:24
starting out here spending energy is
the first thing that the cell is

291
00:24:24 --> 00:24:27
doing.  It's using up an ADP,
although the overall goal is to make

292
00:24:27 --> 00:24:32
ADP.
It then does a little shuffle,

293
00:24:32 --> 00:24:38
reverses the position of the double
bond and the hydroxyl.

294
00:24:38 --> 00:24:44
This is an energetically something
without much cost,

295
00:24:44 --> 00:24:51
but this sugar is different because
this is now fructose-6-phosphate.

296
00:24:51 --> 00:24:57
It's got a little bit different
arrangement of the double bond and

297
00:24:57 --> 00:25:04
the hydroxyl, but energetically it's
pretty much the same thing.

298
00:25:04 --> 00:25:10
Then the next thing that happens the
cells spends another molecule of ATP.

299
00:25:10 --> 00:25:25
It gives now --

300
00:25:25 --> 00:25:31
-- fructose-1,
, this is the sixth position,

301
00:25:31 --> 00:25:37
the one position to two position,
1,6-diphosphate.

302
00:25:37 --> 00:25:41
It doesn't look like we're on our
way to make energy yet.

303
00:25:41 --> 00:25:46
Cells invested two molecules of ATP
and what it's done is it's got this

304
00:25:46 --> 00:25:50
glucose transformed to fructose 1,
-disphopshate.  Well, what happens

305
00:25:50 --> 00:25:55
now then is the cell splits this
into two three carbon units.

306
00:25:55 --> 00:26:00
There were six carbons in glucose.
Yeah?

307
00:26:00 --> 00:26:10
Well, it's a linear molecule.

308
00:26:10 --> 00:26:14
There's a phosphate here and a
separate phosphate down there.

309
00:26:14 --> 00:26:19
They should be.  Yeah.  I'm
probably dropping charges and

310
00:26:19 --> 00:26:23
hydroxyls, OK?
But check your book if you notice

311
00:26:23 --> 00:26:28
something like that.
So what we get --

312
00:26:28 --> 00:26:32
What the cell gets out of this then
are two three carbon units,

313
00:26:32 --> 00:26:45
one of which is this --

314
00:26:45 --> 00:26:49
-- known as dihydroxyacetone
phosphate.  And you can find these

315
00:26:49 --> 00:26:54
names in your book.
You don't have to, as I say,

316
00:26:54 --> 00:26:58
remember the structures.
What I've done is basically taken

317
00:26:58 --> 00:27:02
this molecule and I've flipped it
over so that the phosphate will be

318
00:27:02 --> 00:27:05
down.  And you'll see why I've done
that in a second.

319
00:27:05 --> 00:27:09
And from the bottom half of the
molecule then we get --

320
00:27:09 --> 00:27:37
This is glycereldahyde-3-phosphate.

321
00:27:37 --> 00:27:41
So this is three carbons.
This is three carbons.  This was

322
00:27:41 --> 00:27:45
six carbons.  So the cell has split
it into these three carbon units

323
00:27:45 --> 00:27:49
that are very similarly related
except where the double bond is.

324
00:27:49 --> 00:27:53
And there's an enzyme that actually
catalyzes the conversion of those

325
00:27:53 --> 00:27:58
two.  It's a catalytically perfect
enzyme that goes.

326
00:27:58 --> 00:28:01
It's just limited by the rate of
diffusion.  And it can do something

327
00:28:01 --> 00:28:05
of the order of ten to the eighth
molecules a second.

328
00:28:05 --> 00:28:09
It's a really, really efficient
catalyst.  So what happens then is

329
00:28:09 --> 00:28:13
this, since these are in equilibrium
the cell is going to now

330
00:28:13 --> 00:28:24
start to pull these --

331
00:28:24 --> 00:28:28
This.  But these will be converted
into that and will be able to get

332
00:28:28 --> 00:28:32
here.  So we're going to follow the
fait then of these --

333
00:28:32 --> 00:28:46
-- two glycaraldahyde-3-phosphate

334
00:28:46 --> 00:28:56
molecules.  Excuse me.
Sorry.  OK.  Now, at this point the

335
00:28:56 --> 00:29:04
cell is at the aldehyde stage.
And it's going to carry out an

336
00:29:04 --> 00:29:08
oxidation reaction.
So it's going to take a couple of

337
00:29:08 --> 00:29:13
electrons away from here,
and it's going to therefore be

338
00:29:13 --> 00:29:17
carrying out an oxidation.
If the molecule is getting oxidized

339
00:29:17 --> 00:29:22
something else has to be reduced.
What's going to get reduced is NAD+.

340
00:29:22 --> 00:29:26
We'll need two molecules of that
because we've got two molecules of

341
00:29:26 --> 00:29:31
glyceraldehydes phosphate.
So we end up with two molecules of

342
00:29:31 --> 00:29:35
NADH plus a hydrogen ion.
And this is an energetically

343
00:29:35 --> 00:29:40
favorable reaction.
So the cell is able to sneak a

344
00:29:40 --> 00:29:45
phosphate in and make a molecule and
still have the reaction go forward,

345
00:29:45 --> 00:29:49
have a molecule that's not very
stable, but it can make it because

346
00:29:49 --> 00:30:00
the overall thing goes forward.

347
00:30:00 --> 00:30:04
And there are two of these.
And what we have now is

348
00:30:04 --> 00:30:09
1,3-phosphoglycerate.
What the cell has basically managed

349
00:30:09 --> 00:30:14
to do is to get two phosphate groups
very, very close together.

350
00:30:14 --> 00:30:19
So you're probably getting,
hopefully, the concept that if you

351
00:30:19 --> 00:30:24
stick a bunch of negative charges
together and hold them together that

352
00:30:24 --> 00:30:29
molecules, if you break one of those
bonds are going to go energetically

353
00:30:29 --> 00:30:35
downhill.
And you can do work.

354
00:30:35 --> 00:30:41
And the way it does that then is in
breaking this bond it uses it to

355
00:30:41 --> 00:30:48
make two molecules of ATP.
So you've now got, this is up at

356
00:30:48 --> 00:31:02
the acid level or a carboxyl group.

357
00:31:02 --> 00:31:07
And we've got three
phosphoglycerates.

358
00:31:07 --> 00:31:12
So at least from the point of view
of this as a plan for making energy,

359
00:31:12 --> 00:31:18
we've now managed to get back those
two ATPs we invested.

360
00:31:18 --> 00:31:23
So up until now we've got our,
the venture capital money we put in

361
00:31:23 --> 00:31:29
has be recovered,
and we've got a couple of molecules

362
00:31:29 --> 00:31:34
of NADH out of it.
But what the cell now does is finish,

363
00:31:34 --> 00:31:39
to carry out some more steps that
let it make a couple more molecules

364
00:31:39 --> 00:31:44
of ATP.  So the first step then is a
kind of just a switcheroo between

365
00:31:44 --> 00:31:50
where this hydroxyl is and this
phosphate is.  So it brings the

366
00:31:50 --> 00:31:55
phosphate up to here.
As you might guess this is

367
00:31:55 --> 00:32:04
energetically not much of a change.

368
00:32:04 --> 00:32:10
However, what it does now is it
enables the cell to eliminate a

369
00:32:10 --> 00:32:16
molecule of water from here so we
get two molecules of water come out

370
00:32:16 --> 00:32:22
because we had all along here we're
carrying on two molecules from up

371
00:32:22 --> 00:32:28
there because we have two of these
three carbon units.

372
00:32:28 --> 00:32:34
Then the molecule that
we then get here --

373
00:32:34 --> 00:32:44
-- is this molecule which is known

374
00:32:44 --> 00:32:52
as phosphoenolpyruvate.
And several of you are saying you

375
00:32:52 --> 00:33:00
don't remember much from chemistry.
So this is a keto group, which I

376
00:33:00 --> 00:33:06
know you were introduced to.
But it's in an equilibrium with

377
00:33:06 --> 00:33:10
what's termed an enol form where you
have an OH here,

378
00:33:10 --> 00:33:15
a double bond like that,
and that's known as an enol.

379
00:33:15 --> 00:33:20
Now, this is energetically greatly
disfavored.  So normally most of the

380
00:33:20 --> 00:33:24
time you find something in a keto
form, but occasionally you find it

381
00:33:24 --> 00:33:29
in an enol form.
And what's happened here really is

382
00:33:29 --> 00:33:34
the cell has trapped what would like
to be a keto at this position in an

383
00:33:34 --> 00:33:38
enol form.  Again,
this is a very energetically

384
00:33:38 --> 00:33:43
unstable molecule.
You've got all these oxygens

385
00:33:43 --> 00:33:48
together, two of these,
and so the cell is once again able

386
00:33:48 --> 00:33:53
to take ADP and make two molecules
of ATP.  And we end up with --

387
00:33:53 --> 00:34:05
-- two molecules of pyruvate.

388
00:34:05 --> 00:34:13
And extraordinary amount of work.
What do we get out of it?  Well,

389
00:34:13 --> 00:34:21
we've got a total of four ATPs now
plus two NADHs.

390
00:34:21 --> 00:34:29
What did we invest?
Two ATPs.  So the net yield from

391
00:34:29 --> 00:34:37
this reaction is two ATPs
plus two NADHs.

392
00:34:37 --> 00:34:43
So strange as it seems this was one
of the first sequences of

393
00:34:43 --> 00:34:49
biochemical steps that were put
together in a pathway that we're

394
00:34:49 --> 00:34:55
capable of letting an organism
generate molecules of ATP,

395
00:34:55 --> 00:35:01
or sort of form of energy money,
but metabolizing something it could

396
00:35:01 --> 00:35:06
find like a molecule of sugar.
There are two enzymatic steps.

397
00:35:06 --> 00:35:10
That means that there has to be a
separate enzyme for every step in

398
00:35:10 --> 00:35:15
the pathway.  Now,
the ATPs, as I said,

399
00:35:15 --> 00:35:19
have energy in bundles of about 12
kilocalories per mole.

400
00:35:19 --> 00:35:24
There's a lot of energy here in
NADH.  And in the next lecture I'm

401
00:35:24 --> 00:35:28
going to talk to you about
respiration, which is something

402
00:35:28 --> 00:35:33
you're aware of.
You know we respire,

403
00:35:33 --> 00:35:38
but chemically what that we'll see
means is basically it's a way of

404
00:35:38 --> 00:35:43
extracting the energy that's in the
NADH by transferring electrons to

405
00:35:43 --> 00:35:47
oxygen.  And that's a wonderful way
to make energy.

406
00:35:47 --> 00:35:52
It's far more efficient than this
ancient pathway,

407
00:35:52 --> 00:35:57
but at the time life started there
wasn't any oxygen in

408
00:35:57 --> 00:36:02
the environment.
And, in fact, it didn't reach,

409
00:36:02 --> 00:36:07
as I said, I think it was something
like 20% of today's levels until we

410
00:36:07 --> 00:36:12
were about a half a billion years or
so ago in evolution.

411
00:36:12 --> 00:36:18
So organisms had to learn to make
energy without oxygen being around.

412
00:36:18 --> 00:36:23
And this was the way that they did
it.  And it was such a success in

413
00:36:23 --> 00:36:28
evolution that our bodies do,
the bacteria in our gut do it and

414
00:36:28 --> 00:36:32
just virtually all living forms.
So it's sort of a biochemical fossil

415
00:36:32 --> 00:36:36
but it was so successful it took
hold.  It's sort of like legs.

416
00:36:36 --> 00:36:40
Those appeared in evolution.  And
there are all sorts of organisms now

417
00:36:40 --> 00:36:43
that use legs,
and they've evolved into wings and

418
00:36:43 --> 00:36:47
everything, but it's all the same
basic idea.  You could imagine a

419
00:36:47 --> 00:36:51
life form that started with wheels.
And maybe if it had been the first

420
00:36:51 --> 00:36:54
thing to do maybe there'd be some
sort of organisms with wheels,

421
00:36:54 --> 00:36:58
but legs were such a success at some
point that that's what got used and

422
00:36:58 --> 00:37:02
then evolution made various
embellishments on it.

423
00:37:02 --> 00:37:07
But there is a problem here.
I don't know if anybody can see

424
00:37:07 --> 00:37:12
what it is.  If I'm going to be able
to use ATP to make energy and I want

425
00:37:12 --> 00:37:18
to keep generating more and more
molecules of ATP so I can build

426
00:37:18 --> 00:37:23
stuff, I cannot give those electrons
in NADH to oxygen.

427
00:37:23 --> 00:37:29
So what would happen if I just kept
running this system?

428
00:37:29 --> 00:37:33
Anybody see what the problem would
be?  Yeah.  You'd run out of NADH,

429
00:37:33 --> 00:37:38
exactly.  We need to somehow recycle
that NAD so it can take place.

430
00:37:38 --> 00:37:43
If we could give it to oxygen,
oxygen as I've told you in

431
00:37:43 --> 00:37:48
respiratory, that would be cool.
But organisms didn't have that

432
00:37:48 --> 00:37:52
option.  And so they worked out ways
of doing things with pyruvate.

433
00:37:52 --> 00:37:57
And this is where you'll see this
coming together with what we talked

434
00:37:57 --> 00:38:02
about the other day.
So let's take those two molecules of

435
00:38:02 --> 00:38:07
pyruvate.  And there are basically
two strategies,

436
00:38:07 --> 00:38:12
two major strategies you find in
nature.  One is to take the two

437
00:38:12 --> 00:38:18
NADHs plus two hydrogen ions and
convert it to two molecules of NAD+

438
00:38:18 --> 00:38:23
so that regenerates it.
And what do you get if you do that?

439
00:38:23 --> 00:38:31
You end up with molecule.

440
00:38:31 --> 00:38:35
Two molecules of that which I
introduced you to the other day.

441
00:38:35 --> 00:38:40
That's lactic acid or lactate, the
organisms that make yogurt carry out.

442
00:38:40 --> 00:38:45
That's what they do.
That's why yogurt goes sour.

443
00:38:45 --> 00:38:50
What the organisms are doing when
they're making the yogurt that you

444
00:38:50 --> 00:38:55
had for lunch,
I love those pictures.

445
00:38:55 --> 00:39:00
I found them on the Web and put
them in.

446
00:39:00 --> 00:39:04
What they're doing really is they're
getting rid of that NADH so that

447
00:39:04 --> 00:39:08
they can do another cycle and make
more energy.  Now,

448
00:39:08 --> 00:39:13
I mentioned that this happens to us,
too.  And this happens in athletic

449
00:39:13 --> 00:39:17
events where you exercise really,
really hard, you know, like sprints

450
00:39:17 --> 00:39:22
or speed skating or something like
that.  Because what happens is

451
00:39:22 --> 00:39:26
you're exercising so hard that you
use up the oxygen in your muscles

452
00:39:26 --> 00:39:31
faster than your bloodstream
can bring you more.

453
00:39:31 --> 00:39:34
So what you're doing is you're
making your muscles go anaerobic.

454
00:39:34 --> 00:39:38
It's like you're going back way,
way in evolution when there's was no

455
00:39:38 --> 00:39:41
oxygen around.
And your muscles have to keep

456
00:39:41 --> 00:39:45
working, so what they do,
since there's no oxygen around,

457
00:39:45 --> 00:39:49
they stick it on pyruvate and you
get lactic acid in your muscles.

458
00:39:49 --> 00:39:52
So if you go out for the track team
in the spring and you haven't

459
00:39:52 --> 00:39:56
exercised and you run a whole lot of
sprints and, God,

460
00:39:56 --> 00:40:00
your muscles are so sore,
they're all full of lactic acid.

461
00:40:00 --> 00:40:04
So you don't have to worry about it
accumulating in your muscles from

462
00:40:04 --> 00:40:08
eating yogurt,
but it does show up in this kind of

463
00:40:08 --> 00:40:12
way.  And the other thing then that
the way nature has found to recycle

464
00:40:12 --> 00:40:16
these NADHs is to it this way,
to carry out a transformation where

465
00:40:16 --> 00:40:20
you get two molecules of carbon
dioxide and two molecules

466
00:40:20 --> 00:40:30
of acetaldehyde.

467
00:40:30 --> 00:40:37
And this can be converted to the two
molecules of carbon dioxide and two

468
00:40:37 --> 00:40:44
molecules of ethanol.
So this is the fermentation that we

469
00:40:44 --> 00:40:51
talked about.  And so when those
yeasts that we saw growing the other

470
00:40:51 --> 00:40:58
day are busy metabolizing sugar into
ethanol and carbon dioxide,

471
00:40:58 --> 00:41:05
the reason they're doing it is they
need to get energy to carry out all

472
00:41:05 --> 00:41:13
the biosynthetic reactions that they
need to make more biomaterial.

473
00:41:13 --> 00:41:16
But what's happening to the whole
system is that you're generating

474
00:41:16 --> 00:41:19
carbon dioxide and making stuff into
ethanol.  So it doesn't matter if

475
00:41:19 --> 00:41:22
people are making wine or beer or
something they're going to distil to

476
00:41:22 --> 00:41:26
make whiskey or brandy or something.
It's all the basic thing.  The

477
00:41:26 --> 00:41:29
yeast take the sugars,
make it into carbon dioxide and to

478
00:41:29 --> 00:41:33
ethanol.
But when you're making bread you're

479
00:41:33 --> 00:41:37
only really interested in the carbon
dioxide because those little bubbles

480
00:41:37 --> 00:41:41
then expand when you heat it up and
that's what makes bread rise.

481
00:41:41 --> 00:41:46
And that was an open fermentation,
as you can guess, like in making

482
00:41:46 --> 00:41:50
wine.  People like to have a closed
system so that,

483
00:41:50 --> 00:41:54
for example, a lactic acid bacteria
doesn't get in and turn your whole

484
00:41:54 --> 00:41:59
set of grapes into something that
would be sour.  Sour wine.

485
00:41:59 --> 00:42:03
So that's where we'll stop today,
the most ancient of these

486
00:42:03 --> 00:42:08
energy-producing things.
Again, you don't have to memorize

487
00:42:08 --> 00:42:12
all this, but I think,
hopefully if you think about,

488
00:42:12 --> 00:42:17
you'll see some really, really
important concepts that are critical

489
00:42:17 --> 00:42:21
to understanding how life works.
OK?  See you on Wednesday.  Happy

490
00:42:21 --> 00:42:24
Valentine's Day.
