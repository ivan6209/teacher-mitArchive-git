1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
So, today we're going to talk about,
we've talked about primary

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:10
productivity on a global scale last
time.  And today,

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:15
we're going to talk about what
regulates that productivity.

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:21
In other words, last time we just
talked about on average the amount

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:26
of carbon and biomass that was
distributed among the ecosystems

6
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
of the globe.
And we talked about deficiencies of

7
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
transfer of that biomass through
food webs, etc.

8
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
By the way, the one universal thing
that everybody seems to like are the

9
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
DVDs at the end of the class,
which is good.  Unfortunately,

10
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
in today's class we are not going to
have one.  So you have something to

11
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
look forward to on Wednesday.
I'll show you one at the end that

12
00:00:50 --> 00:00:54
is really one of the cooler ones of
the collection.

13
00:00:54 --> 00:00:58
It has nothing to do with the
lecture but I'm going to

14
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
show it to you anyway.
OK, so today we are going to talk

15
00:01:02 --> 00:01:07
about what regulates the
productivity.  We've talked about

16
00:01:07 --> 00:01:11
these complex systems in ecology,
and the feedback mechanisms.  So, in

17
00:01:11 --> 00:01:16
the context of productivity we're
going to talk about the factors,

18
00:01:16 --> 00:01:21
the abiotic factors, to the
non-living parts of the Earth,

19
00:01:21 --> 00:01:25
that regulate this productivity and
how the productivity feeds back on

20
00:01:25 --> 00:01:30
those.  And then Wednesday,
we're going to put it all together

21
00:01:30 --> 00:01:35
in an analysis of global
biogeochemical cycles,

22
00:01:35 --> 00:01:40
how the elements in the globe cycle,
and how that's mediated by organisms.

23
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
And then, that will be the end of
the segment.  And when I come back,

24
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47
we're going to move on to population
and community ecology,

25
00:01:47 --> 00:01:50
which will feel like a totally
different subject to you.

26
00:01:50 --> 00:01:54
So, we'll talk more about organisms.
And some of you said it was so

27
00:01:54 --> 00:01:58
interesting to see math last time in
the last lecture even if they were

28
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
just efficiencies.
Well, when you get to population

29
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
ecology, you're going to have real
math and you'll actually have

30
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
differential equations.
So, if you like that you have

31
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
something to look forward to.
If you don't like it, well, it's

32
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
not too bad.  OK,
so today the lecture will be in two

33
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
halves.  We'll talk about
terrestrial productivity,

34
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
and then aquatic productivity and
what regulates it.

35
00:02:24 --> 00:02:28
And, can you see in the back or do
I need to turn,

36
00:02:28 --> 00:02:32
I'm going to have to turn the lights
down, never mind.

37
00:02:32 --> 00:02:37
So, because we have some colored
images, so let's start with

38
00:02:37 --> 00:02:42
terrestrial productivity.
And look at this map, oops,

39
00:02:42 --> 00:02:47
wrong ones.  I think that might be
enough to see it,

40
00:02:47 --> 00:02:53
which is a satellite image.
You've seen several of these so far.

41
00:02:53 --> 00:02:58
So just showing the gradients of
productivity on a global scale,

42
00:02:58 --> 00:03:04
where we're just looking at the land
now.

43
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
Where it's green,
you have high levels of productivity.

44
00:03:08 --> 00:03:13
These are grams carbon per meter
squared per year.

45
00:03:13 --> 00:03:17
Yellow is intermediate,
and red is very low levels of

46
00:03:17 --> 00:03:22
productivity.  So,
what determines this distribution of

47
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
productivity in terrestrial
ecosystems?  Well,

48
00:03:26 --> 00:03:39
got any ideas?  This is not hard.

49
00:03:39 --> 00:03:46
What's a key factor in regulating
plant growth on land?

50
00:03:46 --> 00:03:53
Light, absolutely.  That's a given.
But looking at this map, what's

51
00:03:53 --> 00:04:00
probably more important?
Water, exactly.

52
00:04:00 --> 00:04:05
If we plot on a global scale,
if we go around to all these

53
00:04:05 --> 00:04:10
ecosystems, and we look at the
average annual rainfall and we plot

54
00:04:10 --> 00:04:15
it against net primary productivity,
you all know what NPP is right, net

55
00:04:15 --> 00:04:20
primary productivity,
you get a graph that look something

56
00:04:20 --> 00:04:25
like this.  Each one of these dots
would be an ecosystem.

57
00:04:25 --> 00:04:31
And this one is millimeters rain
per year.

58
00:04:31 --> 00:04:36
So, despite the Sahara Desert,
and this might be a tropical rain

59
00:04:36 --> 00:04:42
forest.  And they scatter,
but there's some sort of general

60
00:04:42 --> 00:04:48
relationship like that,
increasing NPP with increasing

61
00:04:48 --> 00:04:54
rainfall.  Well,
what else is probably important?

62
00:04:54 --> 00:05:00
What else is different between the
Sahara Desert and the northern

63
00:05:00 --> 00:05:05
US?  Temperature.
Exactly, which is not a good example

64
00:05:05 --> 00:05:11
for comparison.
Let's take tropical rain forests

65
00:05:11 --> 00:05:17
and the northern US.
How's that?  But you get something

66
00:05:17 --> 00:05:22
like this.  In other words,
it doesn't always map directly onto

67
00:05:22 --> 00:05:28
temperature alone.
But on average, you find that

68
00:05:28 --> 00:05:34
places with higher temperature have
higher productivity if there's

69
00:05:34 --> 00:05:40
adequate water.
So, does a relationship,

70
00:05:40 --> 00:05:46
there's an interaction between the
water and the temperature.

71
00:05:46 --> 00:05:52
So, those are the key factors for
terrestrial ecosystems.

72
00:05:52 --> 00:05:58
Now, what we have, so there's light,
nutrients, I mean light,

73
00:05:58 --> 00:06:03
rain, and temperature, rainfall.
What about nutrients?

74
00:06:03 --> 00:06:08
Anybody who's had plants and their
room, or nurtured our garden knows

75
00:06:08 --> 00:06:13
that nutrients are very important.
You have to fertilize in order to

76
00:06:13 --> 00:06:18
get the most growth.
So, how does that work?

77
00:06:18 --> 00:06:23
Well, now we are going to do an
analysis of a terrestrial ecosystem.

78
00:06:23 --> 00:06:28
We're going to use a tree.  Some
ecosystems you have,

79
00:06:28 --> 00:06:34
that's a rock in case you didn't
recognize it.

80
00:06:34 --> 00:06:41
And we have soil.
These are components.

81
00:06:41 --> 00:06:48
And, we've talked about this over,
and over, and over now.

82
00:06:48 --> 00:06:55
Photosynthesis is the key,
taking up CO2, evolving oxygen,

83
00:06:55 --> 00:07:02
we are going to call this
biosynthesis.

84
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
That's the mass from gas.
So, that's CO2 plus, and now we're

85
00:07:06 --> 00:07:11
going to add something.
And these are not balanced chemical

86
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15
reactions, OK?
These are just to give you an idea

87
00:07:15 --> 00:07:20
of what's going on.
So, CO2  plus, there's all the

88
00:07:20 --> 00:07:25
elements required for life,
OK?  In other words, for a plant to

89
00:07:25 --> 00:07:30
grow, it doesn't only
need CO2 and water.

90
00:07:30 --> 00:07:35
It needs all of these elements
required for life.

91
00:07:35 --> 00:07:41
And they are converted to organic
forms of those elements.

92
00:07:41 --> 00:07:46
And then oxygen is evolved.
So, we are in a general sense,

93
00:07:46 --> 00:07:52
just modifying the equation for
photosynthesis to include all of the

94
00:07:52 --> 00:07:58
elements that are required for life.
So that's the biosynthesis.

95
00:07:58 --> 00:08:03
And then, the tree,
these are leaves in case you didn't

96
00:08:03 --> 00:08:08
recognize them,
that are falling to the soil.

97
00:08:08 --> 00:08:13
And the leaves fall down to the
soil and they become,

98
00:08:13 --> 00:08:19
what?  What's that organic manner?
You learn it last time.  It's the

99
00:08:19 --> 00:08:24
whale falling to the bottom of the
ocean, and if that was a carcass,

100
00:08:24 --> 00:08:30
the general term for dead, organic
matter is called detritus.

101
00:08:30 --> 00:08:34
And there is a detritivore food web,
remember?  And we had some

102
00:08:34 --> 00:08:39
discussion with students after class
whether we were detritivores,

103
00:08:39 --> 00:08:44
because in a sense we are because we
eat dead meat,

104
00:08:44 --> 00:08:48
right?  We don't eat live meat.
It doesn't matter.  You don't have

105
00:08:48 --> 00:08:53
to know that.  Forget that.
But it's interesting to think about.

106
00:08:53 --> 00:08:58
So, the leaves fall down to the
soil.  They are acted upon by the

107
00:08:58 --> 00:09:03
heterotrophic bacteria,
the bacteria that use organic carbon.

108
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
And, what happens is that those
bacteria and fungi,

109
00:09:07 --> 00:09:12
and worms, and everything that chews
on organic matter are responsible

110
00:09:12 --> 00:09:17
for regenerating these elements in
the soil.  So,

111
00:09:17 --> 00:09:22
we are going to call that
regeneration.  And that's basically,

112
00:09:22 --> 00:09:27
simply the back reaction of this, OK?
So, you are starting

113
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
with organic carbon.
And, organic carbon,

114
00:09:32 --> 00:09:38
organic PNS, and it's converting it
back to the inorganic forms so that

115
00:09:38 --> 00:09:43
they're available for the tree to
take up again.

116
00:09:43 --> 00:09:49
So, this is the cycle of
biosynthesis regeneration,

117
00:09:49 --> 00:09:54
and then take it up again.  Some of
the feedback I got on the lectures

118
00:09:54 --> 00:10:00
when people said that they found it
interesting to think about how

119
00:10:00 --> 00:10:06
everything in nature is
recycled and used.

120
00:10:06 --> 00:10:11
Now, in some ecosystems,
there's another form of available

121
00:10:11 --> 00:10:17
nutrients: calcium here,
you have cations, potassium from

122
00:10:17 --> 00:10:23
rocks, magnesium.
All of these are also in this

123
00:10:23 --> 00:10:29
equation.  When I go dot,
dot, dot, dot, it's every element

124
00:10:29 --> 00:10:34
that's required for life.
And in some ecosystems,

125
00:10:34 --> 00:10:39
the [disillusion?] of these elements
from rocks is an important renewal

126
00:10:39 --> 00:10:44
route for nutrients in the ecosystem,
OK?  So these are the two,

127
00:10:44 --> 00:10:48
basically in terrestrial ecosystems,
there is the rock source, and

128
00:10:48 --> 00:10:53
there's the regeneration source.
And it turns out that different

129
00:10:53 --> 00:10:58
terrestrial ecosystems have
different relative dependence on

130
00:10:58 --> 00:11:05
these two sources.
And this is an interesting phenomena.

131
00:11:05 --> 00:11:13
So, tropical rain forests,
like in the Amazon, these are the

132
00:11:13 --> 00:11:21
forests that we're concerned about
losing for many reasons.

133
00:11:21 --> 00:11:30
And these have, essentially,
no number one up here.

134
00:11:30 --> 00:11:36
Tropical rain forests have
essentially no renewal nutrients

135
00:11:36 --> 00:11:43
from bedrock.  And temperate forests,
however, have a combination of one

136
00:11:43 --> 00:11:49
and two.  They can have renewal.
The bedrock is exposed, and the

137
00:11:49 --> 00:11:56
water cycle helps dissolve the rock,
and renews the nutrients to the

138
00:11:56 --> 00:12:08
system.
So, if we look at the soil to

139
00:12:08 --> 00:12:24
biomass ratio of phosphorus and
nitrogen in the temperate forests

140
00:12:24 --> 00:12:40
versus the tropical, we see
something like this.

141
00:12:40 --> 00:12:45
In the tropical rain forests,
all of the nutrients in the system

142
00:12:45 --> 00:12:51
are basically tied up in the biomass.
And it's highly dependent,

143
00:12:51 --> 00:12:57
then, on this regeneration cycle.
The trees fall down, it's

144
00:12:57 --> 00:13:02
regenerated, it's taken up right
away from the soil whereas in the

145
00:13:02 --> 00:13:08
temperate system,
you see the opposite where there's a

146
00:13:08 --> 00:13:14
much higher proportion of nutrients
in the soil relative to

147
00:13:14 --> 00:13:19
the tropical system.
And what that means is that if you

148
00:13:19 --> 00:13:23
cut down a tropical rain forest,
which they're doing, converting to

149
00:13:23 --> 00:13:28
farmland, you will only get a few
years of productivity out of that

150
00:13:28 --> 00:13:33
farmland because once you shut down
the forests and haul away the trees,

151
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
you've hauled away most of the
nutrients in that ecosystem that are

152
00:13:37 --> 00:13:41
available to fuel productivity.
And they can't be renewed from

153
00:13:41 --> 00:13:45
bedrock because they don't have
bedrock there.

154
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
So, that's one of the tragedies of
cutting down these forests when they

155
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
probably would have more economic
value by harvesting some of the

156
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
natural products from
the forests.

157
00:13:56 --> 00:14:05
OK, so when we get to aquatic
productivity, we are going to see

158
00:14:05 --> 00:14:14
that we have these same biosynthesis
and regeneration processes.

159
00:14:14 --> 00:14:23
So, that's what we're going to move
to now.  And let's look at the

160
00:14:23 --> 00:14:33
distribution of aquatic productivity.
That's too much.

161
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
A while.  Can you see that in the
back OK, the colors?

162
00:14:37 --> 00:14:42
All right.  So, now we're just
looking at the ocean's ecosystem.

163
00:14:42 --> 00:14:47
And areas that are blue and green
are less productive than the areas

164
00:14:47 --> 00:14:52
that are red and yellow in the
system.  So you can see all of the

165
00:14:52 --> 00:14:57
coastal regions; we have coastal
upwelling that we're going to talk

166
00:14:57 --> 00:15:02
about a lot with nutrients fueling
that, that is very important.

167
00:15:02 --> 00:15:06
And on the whole north Atlantic here
we'll talk about that.

168
00:15:06 --> 00:15:10
But before we talk about what
regulates aquatic productivity,

169
00:15:10 --> 00:15:14
now I am going to turn the lights
out, I thought I'd give you a tour.

170
00:15:14 --> 00:15:18
Since you all know trees look like
but you don't know what primary

171
00:15:18 --> 00:15:22
producers in the ocean ecosystems
look like, I'm going to give you a

172
00:15:22 --> 00:15:26
quick tour through the phytoplankton,
which as you know, are my

173
00:15:26 --> 00:15:30
favorite organisms.
So, the aquatic productivity is

174
00:15:30 --> 00:15:34
dominated by these microscopic
plants.  There are over 20,

175
00:15:34 --> 00:15:39
00 species, but we really have no
idea how many there are.

176
00:15:39 --> 00:15:43
Wherever there's water, they exist.
They range from 0.5 to 1,000 µ in

177
00:15:43 --> 00:15:48
diameter.  And as I told you in the
first lecture,

178
00:15:48 --> 00:15:53
there's as much genetic information
and a liter of seawater that

179
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
contains these primary producers and
all the bacteria but they live with

180
00:15:57 --> 00:16:02
than there is in the human genome.
So here's some of my favorites.

181
00:16:02 --> 00:16:06
These are marine diatoms.  This is
a silicon shell.

182
00:16:06 --> 00:16:10
This is a single cell.
It's about 30 µ in diameter.

183
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
And this is made out of amorphous
silicon.  It's essentially opal.

184
00:16:14 --> 00:16:19
And here's another one.  They come
in different shapes and sizes.

185
00:16:19 --> 00:16:23
They're just really incredibly
beautiful.  And people are just

186
00:16:23 --> 00:16:27
starting to study what mechanisms
are responsible for laying down

187
00:16:27 --> 00:16:32
these exquisite architectures.
Here's another one.

188
00:16:32 --> 00:16:39
To me this always remind me of the
Coliseum for some reason.

189
00:16:39 --> 00:16:46
These are pillbox shaped cells.
And they have two halves like that.

190
00:16:46 --> 00:16:53
And when they grow, when they
divide, one half lays down another

191
00:16:53 --> 00:17:00
half inside of it.
Now, what's going to happen

192
00:17:00 --> 00:17:05
ultimately if these are rigid?
They get smaller.

193
00:17:05 --> 00:17:09
One lineage gets smaller,
and smaller, and smaller.  Well,

194
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
both of them get smaller, and
smaller.  And this group of

195
00:17:13 --> 00:17:17
organisms has this really neat
system where when it gets really

196
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
tiny, they differentiate into egg
and sperm.  They made,

197
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
and that they make a giant cell
again.  And they start the whole

198
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
thing.  It's cool.
Just to show you some of the things

199
00:17:28 --> 00:17:32
people have studied,
people have wondered why have they

200
00:17:32 --> 00:17:35
evolved this very heavy armor?
And of course,

201
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
the first thing you think about is
resistance to predation.

202
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
But there was never any evidence
for that.  And so,

203
00:17:41 --> 00:17:45
I just found this recent study in
nature that shows where they

204
00:17:45 --> 00:17:48
actually measured.
I thought MIT students look like

205
00:17:48 --> 00:17:51
this because they actually measure
the force that it takes to crush one

206
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
of these cells.
Here's the study.

207
00:17:54 --> 00:17:57
There is a diatom [thrustule?
and they're putting a measured

208
00:17:57 --> 00:18:01
force on it to see what
would crush it.

209
00:18:01 --> 00:18:05
And they were able to show that the
amount of force that it takes is

210
00:18:05 --> 00:18:10
enough to have a selective advantage
against the crunching parts of the

211
00:18:10 --> 00:18:15
zooplankton that eat them.
I also want to point out, this is

212
00:18:15 --> 00:18:20
from the website of Dr.
Angela Belcher, who is a professor

213
00:18:20 --> 00:18:25
here at MIT and material sciences.
And she is studying diatoms.

214
00:18:25 --> 00:18:30
Here's a diatom.
She's studying them as a material,

215
00:18:30 --> 00:18:35
this amorphous silicon, looking at
the way it's laid down.

216
00:18:35 --> 00:18:38
And she's also studying
coccolithophores,

217
00:18:38 --> 00:18:41
which is another group of my
favorite organisms.

218
00:18:41 --> 00:18:44
They have these calcium carbonate
plates.  Again,

219
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
this is a single cell.
But it's cell wall is made up of

220
00:18:47 --> 00:18:51
calcium carbonate plates.
And they come in all different

221
00:18:51 --> 00:18:54
shapes and sizes.
Here's a really weird one with

222
00:18:54 --> 00:18:57
these huge, they're called
coccoliths.  And these cells,

223
00:18:57 --> 00:19:00
this is a satellite image of
reflection, of light.

224
00:19:00 --> 00:19:04
In these cells, the calcium
carbonate, reflects light.

225
00:19:04 --> 00:19:08
And this is a coccolithophore bloom
somewhere I think in the Bering Sea.

226
00:19:08 --> 00:19:12
And we can measure these, but we
have no idea what causes a

227
00:19:12 --> 00:19:16
particular species to bloom at a
particular point in time.

228
00:19:16 --> 00:19:20
It's one of the challenges of
oceanography.  Here's another group

229
00:19:20 --> 00:19:25
of organisms.  The cyanobacteria:
we've talked about them a little bit.

230
00:19:25 --> 00:19:29
These are prokaryotic cells that
can fix nitrogen.

231
00:19:29 --> 00:19:33
They're one of the few groups of
microbes that can take nitrogen gas

232
00:19:33 --> 00:19:37
from the atmosphere and convert it
to ammonia, which draws

233
00:19:37 --> 00:19:42
it in to the food web.
So you can actually see a bloom here.

234
00:19:42 --> 00:19:46
That one's called trichodesmium.
It grows out in the open Atlantic

235
00:19:46 --> 00:19:50
and Pacific.  Here's a bloom of
trichodesmium sucking nitrogen into

236
00:19:50 --> 00:19:54
the ecosystem,
converting it into ammonia,

237
00:19:54 --> 00:19:58
making it available to the other
organisms.  Here's the organism we

238
00:19:58 --> 00:20:02
work on, unfortunately very boring
looking, not as exciting looking at

239
00:20:02 --> 00:20:06
the other ones.
And now, this is just under a light

240
00:20:06 --> 00:20:11
microscope.  These are less than a
micron in diameter.

241
00:20:11 --> 00:20:16
But if you shine blue light on them,
they fluoresce red.

242
00:20:16 --> 00:20:21
The chlorophyll in them fluoresces
red.  And these are the smallest and

243
00:20:21 --> 00:20:26
simplest photosynthetic cell.
They have 1,700 genes.

244
00:20:26 --> 00:20:29
And with that,
I call them the essence of life

245
00:20:29 --> 00:20:33
because with 1,
00 genes, they can convert CO2,

246
00:20:33 --> 00:20:37
nitrogen, phosphorus, all inorganic
compounds, basically this rock over

247
00:20:37 --> 00:20:41
here, in sunlight into life.
And this happens to be like that

248
00:20:41 --> 00:20:44
dominates the oceans.
They are the most abundant cell in

249
00:20:44 --> 00:20:48
the oceans.  In some areas,
it's about 50% of the total

250
00:20:48 --> 00:20:52
chlorophyll.  So,
they are basically a lean,

251
00:20:52 --> 00:20:56
mean photosynthesis machine,
and we're trying to understand

252
00:20:56 --> 00:21:01
everything about it.
OK, does a digression,

253
00:21:01 --> 00:21:09
hopefully not a diversion.
So, what regulates aquatic primary

254
00:21:09 --> 00:21:16
productivity?  Have to turn the
lights back on.

255
00:21:16 --> 00:21:24
Before we get into that totally,
I want to draw a typical, what we

256
00:21:24 --> 00:21:32
call a water column in
an aquatic ecosystem.

257
00:21:32 --> 00:21:36
And I have seen this little red,
sticky thing here.  This is from

258
00:21:36 --> 00:21:40
last year, and it says they don't
understand these axes.

259
00:21:40 --> 00:21:44
See, I remember from year to year.
So, if you don't understand

260
00:21:44 --> 00:21:48
something and doing,
because I can tell when students

261
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
come up afterwards that I've
completely lost you.

262
00:21:52 --> 00:21:56
First of all, oceanographers plot
things upside down.

263
00:21:56 --> 00:22:00
So this is depth.  So,
depth goes down, which makes sense,

264
00:22:00 --> 00:22:05
right?
And then, whatever we are plotting

265
00:22:05 --> 00:22:11
against depth is on this axis.
So, in this graph I'm going to make,

266
00:22:11 --> 00:22:17
we are going to plot net primary
productivity, temperature,

267
00:22:17 --> 00:22:23
nutrients, a bunch of different
variables.  OK,

268
00:22:23 --> 00:22:29
and for oceans, this is about,
well, we'll just say 2,000 m, and

269
00:22:29 --> 00:22:36
for lakes, say, 200 m
for a deep lake.

270
00:22:36 --> 00:22:44
So, I'm drawing here sort of a
generic picture of a water column in

271
00:22:44 --> 00:22:52
either a lake or ocean.
OK, so do we have colored chalk?

272
00:22:52 --> 00:23:00
Not here, OK.  Sometimes it used to
float around.

273
00:23:00 --> 00:23:05
Well, you're going to have to use
your imagination.

274
00:23:05 --> 00:23:11
So first of all, let's plot light
as a function of depth.

275
00:23:11 --> 00:23:17
What does that look like?
Like that, exactly.  It's going to

276
00:23:17 --> 00:23:23
decay exponentially.
In lakes, this is about 10 m,

277
00:23:23 --> 00:23:29
and in oceans this is about 100 m.

278
00:23:29 --> 00:23:33
Oh, and this was a question somebody
gave in the instant feedback.

279
00:23:33 --> 00:23:38
Somebody said, I find it hard to
believe that all life in the oceans

280
00:23:38 --> 00:23:43
disappears where there is no more
light.  And, you're absolutely right.

281
00:23:43 --> 00:23:48
It's only the photosynthetic life
that disappears when there's no more

282
00:23:48 --> 00:23:53
light.  There's lots of life below
there that is using organic carbon.

283
00:23:53 --> 00:23:57
So, if you're here, that the answer
to your question.

284
00:23:57 --> 00:24:02
OK, so then, now we're going to
plot temperature which looks

285
00:24:02 --> 00:24:08
something like this.
And, this is what's called the

286
00:24:08 --> 00:24:14
[thermocline?].
And we can also think of this as

287
00:24:14 --> 00:24:20
density.  Because colder water is
more dense than warmer water,

288
00:24:20 --> 00:24:26
right, you must have learned that,
did you learn that somewhere?  Did

289
00:24:26 --> 00:24:33
you learn that somewhere?
Where did you learn that?

290
00:24:33 --> 00:24:40
Fourth grade, great,
well-prepared.  So, up on the

291
00:24:40 --> 00:24:47
surface we have biosynthesis here
where there's light,

292
00:24:47 --> 00:24:54
and so it's exactly the same
reaction as we have over here.

293
00:24:54 --> 00:25:02
And now it gets to the terrestrial
ecosystem.

294
00:25:02 --> 00:25:06
The production you have in the
surface water is you have

295
00:25:06 --> 00:25:10
phytoplankton photosynthesizing,
making organic matter.  They're

296
00:25:10 --> 00:25:14
being eaten by zooplankton,
by fish that are making feces,

297
00:25:14 --> 00:25:19
etc., that are being eaten by the
detritivores.  But the net effect of

298
00:25:19 --> 00:25:23
this teeming food web they saw in
the DVD last time,

299
00:25:23 --> 00:25:27
is that there's going to be organic
carbon that falls down

300
00:25:27 --> 00:25:33
below this lit zone.
OK, and that was the whale calling

301
00:25:33 --> 00:25:40
out to make, no,
not purposefully,

302
00:25:40 --> 00:25:47
but telling down and making carbon
available to the food web in the

303
00:25:47 --> 00:25:54
deep water.  So down here,
you have regeneration.  So this is

304
00:25:54 --> 00:26:01
light.  And this is in the
dark in the system.

305
00:26:01 --> 00:26:07
But it's directly analogous to the
biosynthesis and regeneration system

306
00:26:07 --> 00:26:13
there.  So the other thing we want
to plot on this is nutrients.

307
00:26:13 --> 00:26:20
They are drawn down to very low
levels in the surface water in the

308
00:26:20 --> 00:26:26
lit layer because the phytoplankton
are sucking them up.

309
00:26:26 --> 00:26:32
They are nutrient limited.
They're sucking up the nitrogen,

310
00:26:32 --> 00:26:38
phosphorus, et cetera.
And then, as the carbon and all of

311
00:26:38 --> 00:26:43
that range down to the deep water,
it's regenerated, and then the

312
00:26:43 --> 00:26:48
nutrients are regenerated.
So that's why you see the gradient

313
00:26:48 --> 00:26:53
of the low nutrients here and high
nutrients here,

314
00:26:53 --> 00:26:58
because the bacteria in the deep
water are breaking down the carbon

315
00:26:58 --> 00:27:03
and releasing them.
OK, so if we look at this map,

316
00:27:03 --> 00:27:08
we can see that for aquatic
ecosystems, obviously water

317
00:27:08 --> 00:27:13
is not limiting.
So water is an important regulator.

318
00:27:13 --> 00:27:19
Light is a very important regulator
of productivity down to about in

319
00:27:19 --> 00:27:25
this region.  And nutrients,
it turns out, are very important.

320
00:27:25 --> 00:27:31
And it's nutrients that really
determine the tapestry of this map

321
00:27:31 --> 00:27:37
that we're looking at.
And what I'm going to do for the

322
00:27:37 --> 00:27:45
rest of the class is explain it
lakes and oceans how the physical

323
00:27:45 --> 00:27:53
forces make these nutrients
available in certain regions more

324
00:27:53 --> 00:28:01
than in other regions and explain
this.  OK, so first let's look at

325
00:28:01 --> 00:28:07
lake ecosystems.
So, what we're showing here is a

326
00:28:07 --> 00:28:12
year in the life of a temperate lake.
So this might be the Mystic Lakes

327
00:28:12 --> 00:28:16
out in Arlington or something like
that.  Well, maybe that doesn't

328
00:28:16 --> 00:28:21
freeze over, I don't know.
But anyway, a lake that freezes

329
00:28:21 --> 00:28:26
over in the winter.
So let's start during the summer,

330
00:28:26 --> 00:28:31
and here's this basic graph showing
the thermocline,

331
00:28:31 --> 00:28:35
the nutrient depletion in the
surface, and this one indicates that

332
00:28:35 --> 00:28:40
you actually have oxygen depletion
in the deep water because of all of

333
00:28:40 --> 00:28:45
this organic matter from
productivity raining down and being

334
00:28:45 --> 00:28:50
consumed by heterotrophic organisms
that consume oxygen.

335
00:28:50 --> 00:28:54
So, as fall comes,
and this is the important part,

336
00:28:54 --> 00:28:59
in the summertime, this layer is
mixed.  So, it's isothermal.

337
00:28:59 --> 00:29:04
In the fall, you have the winds and
the surface cools.

338
00:29:04 --> 00:29:08
And as this density gradient here
starts to break down,

339
00:29:08 --> 00:29:12
do the cooling in the winds.
And so, you have this mixing.

340
00:29:12 --> 00:29:17
It's called fall overturn, which
[then trains?] these nutrients from

341
00:29:17 --> 00:29:21
the deep water into the surface.
So that's what way you get the

342
00:29:21 --> 00:29:26
nutrients for the deep water back up
into the surface,

343
00:29:26 --> 00:29:30
whereas in the summertime,
the gradient is maintained because

344
00:29:30 --> 00:29:35
of this density barrier,
and the mixing can't bring this down.

345
00:29:35 --> 00:29:39
And then in the winter,
you have the ice cover that

346
00:29:39 --> 00:29:44
obviously everything then is just
isothermal.  There's not much going

347
00:29:44 --> 00:29:49
on, but there is some photosynthesis.
And then in the spring,

348
00:29:49 --> 00:29:54
the surface waters start to warm up,
the ice melts, you have overturn,

349
00:29:54 --> 00:29:59
and brings the water up
from the deep water.

350
00:29:59 --> 00:30:03
In the ocean, in lakes,
this can mix all the way to the

351
00:30:03 --> 00:30:07
bottom, OK?  In the oceans,
there's no force of nature that can

352
00:30:07 --> 00:30:12
mix all the way down to 2,
00 m.  So you have this thermocline

353
00:30:12 --> 00:30:16
in the oceans,
but it's in a relatively small

354
00:30:16 --> 00:30:20
fraction of the total water column.
So the scale here is way off.

355
00:30:20 --> 00:30:25
We're going from 100 m down to 2,
00.  So in the ocean, it's just this

356
00:30:25 --> 00:30:29
tiny little, all this action in the
surface.  So we need another

357
00:30:29 --> 00:30:34
mechanism.  We can't mix all the way
down to the deep ocean.

358
00:30:34 --> 00:30:41
So, we need another mechanism for
bringing nutrients to the surface.

359
00:30:41 --> 00:30:49
And we're going to talk about,
there's four different ways.

360
00:30:49 --> 00:31:06
There's four different ways that the

361
00:31:06 --> 00:31:13
deep water nutrients are brought
back up where there is light,

362
00:31:13 --> 00:31:20
because you have to have liked for
photosynthesis to use the nutrients.

363
00:31:20 --> 00:31:27
And one is episodic mixing.  I'm
just going to list them,

364
00:31:27 --> 00:31:35
and then we're going to go through
them: coastal upwelling --

365
00:31:35 --> 00:31:45
-- equatorial upwelling,
and on much longer time scales,

366
00:31:45 --> 00:31:55
what's called the “oceanic conveyor
belt” in quotes,

367
00:31:55 --> 00:32:05
which is basically local ocean
circulation.

368
00:32:05 --> 00:32:10
So let's go through these.
In the oceans, episodic mixing,

369
00:32:10 --> 00:32:15
let's go back.  Now, just pretend
this is an ocean,

370
00:32:15 --> 00:32:20
and that this goes down to 2,
00 m, and there's a thermocline.

371
00:32:20 --> 00:32:25
What happens in the oceans is that
you just have little,

372
00:32:25 --> 00:32:30
episodic mixing events that you
wrote a great here to get little

373
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
bursts of nutrients injected
into the lit area.

374
00:32:36 --> 00:32:40
That's seasonal mixing,
but it never mixes all the way to

375
00:32:40 --> 00:32:45
the bottom.  And we can see,
I'll show you where, this right here

376
00:32:45 --> 00:32:50
is the north Atlantic's bloom.
And in the springtime, you see

377
00:32:50 --> 00:32:55
major bloom there due to this
episodic mixing in the North

378
00:32:55 --> 00:33:00
Atlantic, which have high winds and
a lot of mixing.

379
00:33:00 --> 00:33:05
OK, so there are also ocean currents
caused by this coastal upwelling

380
00:33:05 --> 00:33:10
phenomenon, especially along the
western coasts of continents.

381
00:33:10 --> 00:33:15
And I don't have time to go into
this.  You need a whole course and

382
00:33:15 --> 00:33:20
physical oceanography to really
understand this  because it has to

383
00:33:20 --> 00:33:25
do with the whole global ocean
circulation that causes this

384
00:33:25 --> 00:33:30
upwelling along the coasts.
But, I'm going to show you how this

385
00:33:30 --> 00:33:35
works in this movie,
or a little movie.

386
00:33:35 --> 00:33:40
I guess that's as dark as we're
going to get.  This is a

387
00:33:40 --> 00:33:46
cross-section of a coastal ocean.
So, here's the coastline.  Here's

388
00:33:46 --> 00:33:51
the surface of the ocean.
And these little molecules here are

389
00:33:51 --> 00:33:57
CO2.  Can you see blue?
This is probably not going to work

390
00:33:57 --> 00:34:02
because of this filming.
Well, we'll see what happens.

391
00:34:02 --> 00:34:06
OK, so going to go through it in a
still, and then I'll show the movie.

392
00:34:06 --> 00:34:11
But what you're going to see is as
blue patch upwelling along the coast

393
00:34:11 --> 00:34:15
here, in CO2 molecules are coming up
with it.  OK, here's the blue.

394
00:34:15 --> 00:34:20
That's nutrients, nitrogen,
phosphorus, etc.

395
00:34:20 --> 00:34:24
The wind is blowing offshore
causing the surface waters to move

396
00:34:24 --> 00:34:29
in that direction.
They have to be replaced by

397
00:34:29 --> 00:34:33
something, so we're bringing the
deep water up to replace that moving

398
00:34:33 --> 00:34:39
surface water.
And as that comes up,

399
00:34:39 --> 00:34:45
the CO2 comes up and is released.
And then you have a phytoplankton

400
00:34:45 --> 00:34:51
bloom from the nutrients,
and then the CO2 sucked back in

401
00:34:51 --> 00:34:57
again and you have oxygen going out.
And, here it goes, the movie.

402
00:34:57 --> 00:35:03
Upwelling: The Movie.
There comes the CO2.  Here are the

403
00:35:03 --> 00:35:09
nutrients.  CO2 out, CO2 back in.
These are phytoplankton,

404
00:35:09 --> 00:35:13
this green blobs.  That's a bloom.
So you have now the phytoplankton

405
00:35:13 --> 00:35:17
falling, big bloom,
organic carbon going down and being

406
00:35:17 --> 00:35:21
regenerated.  So,
it's a very dynamic system and

407
00:35:21 --> 00:35:25
that's why you have a lot of
high-intensity fisheries along the

408
00:35:25 --> 00:35:29
coasts, especially the western coast
of continents because of this

409
00:35:29 --> 00:35:33
upwelling; there's lots of nutrients,
lots of phytoplankton,

410
00:35:33 --> 00:35:38
lots of fish.
A dramatic example of the power of

411
00:35:38 --> 00:35:45
the surface currents,
and how they affect upwelling is

412
00:35:45 --> 00:35:51
this phenomenon called El Niño.
I think I'll skip the slide.  You

413
00:35:51 --> 00:35:58
don't have it in hand out,
anyway.  But here's an animation

414
00:35:58 --> 00:36:05
showing the changes in the
productivity in the Pacific Ocean

415
00:36:05 --> 00:36:12
along the equator.
Here's an El Niño.

416
00:36:12 --> 00:36:18
And I'll explain how that works in
a minute.  Here's a normal year

417
00:36:18 --> 00:36:24
where you have these phytoplankton
blooms, and let's look at it in this.

418
00:36:24 --> 00:36:30
You've seen this one before,
but let's look at it more closely.

419
00:36:30 --> 00:36:36
There's the equatorial bloom caused
by upwelling along the equator and

420
00:36:36 --> 00:36:40
are normally year.
And as we go around,

421
00:36:40 --> 00:36:44
this is like three years in the life
of the globe.  See,

422
00:36:44 --> 00:36:48
there is high productivity at the
Amazon where the Amazon's empty.

423
00:36:48 --> 00:36:52
Now, we are going to zoom in here,
and this is a normal year.  And

424
00:36:52 --> 00:36:56
that's an El Niño year.
You see, there's very little

425
00:36:56 --> 00:37:00
productivity, and is very little
upwelling along the coasts here.

426
00:37:00 --> 00:37:06
And that El Niño in Spanish,
what does it mean?  It refers to the

427
00:37:06 --> 00:37:12
Christ Child because this happens
around Christmastime roughly every

428
00:37:12 --> 00:37:18
seven years.  And what happens in a
phenomenon is it turned out that

429
00:37:18 --> 00:37:25
people have studied enough
for years.

430
00:37:25 --> 00:37:30
It's a global phenomenon in which
the prevailing currents in the whole

431
00:37:30 --> 00:37:35
Pacific Ocean shift from going in
this direction which causes the

432
00:37:35 --> 00:37:40
upwelling here to going in this
direction, which brings warm water

433
00:37:40 --> 00:37:46
suppressing the upwelling and
reducing the nutrient input into the

434
00:37:46 --> 00:37:51
system.  OK, so here's an El Niño
year, and directly compared to

435
00:37:51 --> 00:37:56
non-El Niño year.
And that's all due to physical

436
00:37:56 --> 00:38:02
force is changing the
nutrient delivery.

437
00:38:02 --> 00:38:10
So here's equatorial upwelling,
and then finally on a global scale,

438
00:38:10 --> 00:38:18
over very long periods of time, you
can imagine that these upwelling

439
00:38:18 --> 00:38:26
events would not be enough to bring,
you have this constant rain of

440
00:38:26 --> 00:38:35
organic matter coming from
the surface waters.

441
00:38:35 --> 00:38:38
And this nutrient reservoir in the
deep waters, none of these upwelling

442
00:38:38 --> 00:38:42
events are enough to bring all that
back and renew the system.

443
00:38:42 --> 00:38:45
So you need a bigger force than
that on a global scale over long

444
00:38:45 --> 00:38:49
time periods.  And that's what's
called the great oceanic conveyor

445
00:38:49 --> 00:38:53
belt.  And this is really important,
because I think people think of the

446
00:38:53 --> 00:38:56
oceans as a static,
understandably, you look out there;

447
00:38:56 --> 00:39:00
it looks like a bunch of water with
the surface waters and

448
00:39:00 --> 00:39:04
with the deep waters.
And if you throw something in the

449
00:39:04 --> 00:39:08
deep waters it's going to stay there
and you don't have to worry about it

450
00:39:08 --> 00:39:12
anymore.  A lot of people want to
bury nuclear waste in the deep water.

451
00:39:12 --> 00:39:16
And the point is that that's not
true.  The oceans are all

452
00:39:16 --> 00:39:20
interconnected,
and if I'm a water molecule,

453
00:39:20 --> 00:39:25
the average amount of time, and I'm
traveling with the currents,

454
00:39:25 --> 00:39:29
over a thousand years, I will make
this whole journey where I go along

455
00:39:29 --> 00:39:33
the surface waters and then I get to
the North Atlantic,

456
00:39:33 --> 00:39:37
and because the waters are cooled
and there's very high winds in the

457
00:39:37 --> 00:39:41
North Atlantic,
you have cold water and of the high

458
00:39:41 --> 00:39:45
winds cause high evaporation.
So you have saltier water,

459
00:39:45 --> 00:39:49
so, cold, saltier water up here
sinks.  And that actually is a force

460
00:39:49 --> 00:39:53
that drives this whole global
circulation.  And so,

461
00:39:53 --> 00:39:57
I'm cruising along here.
I get here, and I sink.  And then I

462
00:39:57 --> 00:40:01
go for this long journey down the
bottom.  And of course,

463
00:40:01 --> 00:40:04
it's much more complicated.
This is grossly oversimplified.

464
00:40:04 --> 00:40:08
But I go this long journey to the
bottom of the Atlantic in these deep

465
00:40:08 --> 00:40:12
ocean currents,
and then somewhere along the line,

466
00:40:12 --> 00:40:16
I get brought up again through zones
of upwelling here,

467
00:40:16 --> 00:40:20
or maybe I would meander up here and
get brought up again.

468
00:40:20 --> 00:40:24
[I'm just one atom on average?
.  So, through these global ocean

469
00:40:24 --> 00:40:28
currents, the deep water eventually
comes up to the surface,

470
00:40:28 --> 00:40:31
bringing those nutrients back.
Where it comes in contact with the

471
00:40:31 --> 00:40:35
light and the phytoplankton,
and they photosynthesize and they

472
00:40:35 --> 00:40:39
take up the nutrients and they make
organic carbonate,

473
00:40:39 --> 00:40:43
and it all settles down again to the
bottom.  So, it's a cycle.

474
00:40:43 --> 00:40:46
And if you didn't have that,
the thing would run down.  If you

475
00:40:46 --> 00:40:50
didn't have the deep water coming up
eventually coming up somewhere,

476
00:40:50 --> 00:40:54
the system would just run down and
you do have a big anoxic bottom of

477
00:40:54 --> 00:40:58
the ocean.  And who knows what would
happen?  So, this is

478
00:40:58 --> 00:41:03
really important.
OK, so finally,

479
00:41:03 --> 00:41:10
I've talked about nutrients just in
general, what nutrients are the most

480
00:41:10 --> 00:41:18
important?  And,
it turns out that there are some

481
00:41:18 --> 00:41:25
nutrients that are in much less
supply that are required by the

482
00:41:25 --> 00:41:33
plants.  And this is what's called,
so, what nutrients are important?

483
00:41:33 --> 00:41:41
Now, of course,
they're all important but some are

484
00:41:41 --> 00:41:50
more important in regulation than
others.  And there's something

485
00:41:50 --> 00:41:58
called the law of the minimum.
And it states that the growth of a

486
00:41:58 --> 00:42:10
plant will be limited --
-- by that element that is in least

487
00:42:10 --> 00:42:24
supply relative,
this is the important part,

488
00:42:24 --> 00:42:38
to the requirements of the plant or
the phytoplankton.

489
00:42:38 --> 00:42:43
When I say plant,
it could be phytoplankton or a tree,

490
00:42:43 --> 00:42:48
or a plant, or whatever.  And this
is the important part.

491
00:42:48 --> 00:42:53
So how we figure out what the
requirements for elements are above

492
00:42:53 --> 00:42:58
plants?  You might grab it,
harvested, grind it up, and measure

493
00:42:58 --> 00:43:04
the ratio of the elements
in that plant.

494
00:43:04 --> 00:43:09
So, for example,
if you do that, for most plants you

495
00:43:09 --> 00:43:15
get something on the order of,
at least for most phytoplankton,

496
00:43:15 --> 00:43:21
which are my  preferred plant, you
get the ratio of carbon,

497
00:43:21 --> 00:43:27
nitrogen, and phosphorus,
of 106 atoms of carbon [for?

498
00:43:27 --> 00:43:33
16 nitrogen per one of phosphorus.
So this tells you in what ratio they

499
00:43:33 --> 00:43:41
need these elements in order to grow.
So then you look in the environment

500
00:43:41 --> 00:43:49
and you ask, what are the ratios
available?  So,

501
00:43:49 --> 00:43:57
say if the water has a ratio of,
what's going to be the most living

502
00:43:57 --> 00:44:05
element in that system
for that plant?

503
00:44:05 --> 00:44:12
Exactly, nitrogen.
And, alternatively,

504
00:44:12 --> 00:44:19
you could have something like this.
And what would be limiting there?

505
00:44:19 --> 00:44:26
Phosphorus limits.
And it turns out that in most

506
00:44:26 --> 00:44:33
aquatic ecosystems,
for now we're going to say that

507
00:44:33 --> 00:44:40
nitrogen and phosphorus are the
important limiting factors.

508
00:44:40 --> 00:44:44
And just to show you,
again, that ecologists do

509
00:44:44 --> 00:44:48
experiments, here's an experimental
lakes area in Ontario,

510
00:44:48 --> 00:44:52
where there are 22 different lakes
set aside for research.

511
00:44:52 --> 00:44:56
And in this particular set of lakes,
this is a control lake,

512
00:44:56 --> 00:45:00
and this is the experimental lake.
They added phosphorus to the lake.

513
00:45:00 --> 00:45:05
And you can see the phytoplankton

514
00:45:05 --> 00:45:09
bloom by only adding phosphorus.
They didn't add anything else.  And

515
00:45:09 --> 00:45:14
that means that phosphorus was in
least supply relative to the other

516
00:45:14 --> 00:45:18
nutrients.  And the interesting
thing that happened here was that

517
00:45:18 --> 00:45:23
when they added the phosphorus,
that makes phosphorus in great

518
00:45:23 --> 00:45:27
abundance relative to nitrogen.
And what that did is make nitrogen

519
00:45:27 --> 00:45:32
the limiting factor.
And when nitrogen is the limiting

520
00:45:32 --> 00:45:37
factor, what organisms might
have an advantage?

521
00:45:37 --> 00:45:40
We talked about them.
Yeah, there you go, nitrogen fixing

522
00:45:40 --> 00:45:44
organisms.  So,
if nitrogen is limiting,

523
00:45:44 --> 00:45:47
only organisms that can take it from
the atmosphere can get more nitrogen

524
00:45:47 --> 00:45:51
than the other organisms.
So they are favored.  And what

525
00:45:51 --> 00:45:54
happens is you fertilize with
phosphorus.  You get blooms of

526
00:45:54 --> 00:45:58
nitrogen fixing organisms.
It's really an interesting

527
00:45:58 --> 00:46:02
phenomenon.
But nitrogen and phosphorus are,

528
00:46:02 --> 00:46:06
one or the other is limiting in
lakes.  And in large areas of the

529
00:46:06 --> 00:46:10
oceans, nitrogen and phosphorus are
also limiting,

530
00:46:10 --> 00:46:14
except we've learned recently that
there are areas of the oceans where

531
00:46:14 --> 00:46:19
iron is actually a limiting factor.
And this was an experiment that was

532
00:46:19 --> 00:46:23
done by oceanographers.
And there is Alaska just to get you

533
00:46:23 --> 00:46:27
oriented.  This is the North Pacific
where they went out with a boat and

534
00:46:27 --> 00:46:31
they made it a patch.
They added iron just to a patch of

535
00:46:31 --> 00:46:36
ocean.
And I can tell you about this.

536
00:46:36 --> 00:46:40
We were involved in some of these
experiments.  It started out with a

537
00:46:40 --> 00:46:45
10 km x 10 km patch and showed that
if you add iron you get a bloom of

538
00:46:45 --> 00:46:49
phytoplankton.
And this is a satellite image of

539
00:46:49 --> 00:46:54
that phytoplankton bloom.
And in the last lecture, I'm going

540
00:46:54 --> 00:46:59
to tell you all about those iron
fertilization experiments,

541
00:46:59 --> 00:47:03
and the implications for how we are
going to use the oceans

542
00:47:03 --> 00:47:08
in the future.
So, take-home messages: we'll talk

543
00:47:08 --> 00:47:12
about that next time.
You can take them home,

544
00:47:12 --> 00:47:15
but I don't want to keep you over.
