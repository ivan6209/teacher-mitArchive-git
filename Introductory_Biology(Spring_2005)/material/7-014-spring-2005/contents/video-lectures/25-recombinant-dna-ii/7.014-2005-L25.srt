1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,000
What we've talked about in
recombinant DNA so far is how to get

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,000
a piece of DNA from somewhere and
make a whole lot of copies of it.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,000
So, instead of working with DNA
extracted from my cells,

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,000
which there's 3 billion different
base pairs of sequence,

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,000
we can find a little stretch of DNA.
But simply being able to clone it,

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,000
it was a long way from him being
able to get a lot of a fragment of

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,000
DNA to be able to figure out what
that sequence is.

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,000
That sequence of that gene is
actually from the [zero derma?

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,000
gene, the gene that's broken and
the zero derma pigmentosa variant

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,000
patience, missing one of these
translesion DNA polymerases that can

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,000
copy over a thymine,
thymine, [permadine?],

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,000
[dymer?], this induced by UV light.
So the reason they have that

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,000
problem with their skin after
sunlight is because they are missing

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,000
a polymerase that can't copy over
accurately over this very common

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,000
lesion caused by DNA damage.
But how do you get from having a

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,000
piece of DNA and having the sequence?
So, the first thing that people

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,000
learn to do, and you still do this
all the time in any molecular

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,000
biology lab.  We're sort of
switching now in engineering as

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,000
you'll see.  You're going to see in
the next things that I'm going to

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,000
say, proteins that were,
I talked to you about because of

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,000
their biological roles.
DNA polymerase is,

22
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,000
ligases, we learned what they do.
And now you're going to see them

23
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,000
used in manipulative ways.
Restriction enzymes: they have a

24
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,000
biological purpose,
too.  They weren't put on Earth for

25
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,000
me to cut up into fragments and
clone.  They were there to give the

26
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,000
bacteria is some kind of primitive
immune system.

27
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,000
But the first thing that you often
have to do, and you have,

28
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,000
let's say, a plasmid into which
we've inserted a fragment.

29
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,000
And let's say it was the kind of
cloning we described the other day,

30
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,000
where I had cut to the vector with
an ECO-R1 site,

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,000
and the other DNA with an ECO-R1
site.  So these,

32
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,000
the junction between the inserted
fragment and the cut vector has

33
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,000
re-created two ECO-R1 sites now.
And if I cut with ECO-R1, I'll just

34
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,000
undo what I did in the cloning,
and we should get the vector DNA and

35
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:39,000
the insert DNA back again.
So, I can go from this vector to

36
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:45,000
give us an orientation.
I'm going to imagine that it has

37
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:51,000
one more restriction site.
This one is called [sal 1?

38
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:57,000
.  It just recognizes a different
sequence.  So,

39
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:03,000
if I take the plasmid DNA and cut
with ECO-R1, I just reversing

40
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,000
the cloning.
So I should get is the vector DNA

41
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:14,000
and the insert that I generated in
the first place.

42
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:20,000
But I have to detect them somehow.
Unfortunately, they don't just look

43
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,000
in the test tube like that.
So, what people do is they use a

44
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,000
very simple principle.
It's called gel electrophoresis.

45
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:43,000
And the idea is you just make a gel

46
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,000
of something.  In this particular
case, it's just made of augur,

47
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,000
which is agarose.  These are
polysaccharide products,

48
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:00,000
often derived from seaweed or
something like that.

49
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,000
They have the property that if you
warm them up, they're liquid,

50
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,000
and that if you let them cool down,
they're a gel.  You've run into

51
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,000
Jell-O which has the property.
That's actually made of a protein

52
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,000
rather than a carbohydrate.
But it's that kind of principle.

53
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,000
So it's very easy to pour something
and that let it solidify.

54
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,000
Now you've got a slab.  And it's
just a network of things that

55
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,000
interact.  And the principle of the
thing is that,

56
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,000
so you have to get the molecules to
move.  Well that's pretty easy with

57
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,000
nucleic acids because
they're charged.

58
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,000
They have all those phosphates.
They've got a lot of negative

59
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,000
charge.  So if you apply an electric
field, they'll move.

60
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,000
And the principle of the thing is
that if you're big,

61
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,000
it's harder to wiggle through this
network than if you are small.

62
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,000
Or you can think of a big, fat
person trying to go through a forest

63
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,000
with a lot of trees,
and a little skinny one.

64
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,000
And if we let them have a race,
eventually the skinny one will

65
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,000
emerge from the forest first.
And so, if we had a set of markers

66
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:13,000
down on the side where this is big,
and this is small, and we take this

67
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:20,000
piece of DNA, we're going to get two
fragments.  The bigger one would be

68
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:27,000
the vector and the smaller one would
be an insert.  So from that,

69
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:34,000
we could say, oh, if I didn't know
what I started with I could say what

70
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:40,000
must be at that plasmid?
Is the vector?

71
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,000
And I can run at all by itself and
see it's exactly the same size.

72
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,000
And I got an insert of this
particular size.

73
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,000
And now, can I learn anything more
about that just using restriction

74
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:03,000
enzymes?  And let's say
I now take the same.

75
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:10,000
Actually, maybe I'll do it over here.
So let's cut,

76
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:17,000
this time, with ECO-R1 plus another
restriction enzyme.

77
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:24,000
They all have these weird names:
[bam H1?], and let's see what

78
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:32,000
happens.  Well suppose I do that and
I get something like this.

79
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:38,000
Well it looks like the vector wasn't
cut at all.  That still seems to be

80
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,000
the same, but it looks as though the
insert got cut into two pieces.

81
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:50,000
Since it was linear, it must have
one site in it.

82
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:56,000
And so, this molecule that I cloned
could look, be one of

83
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:06,000
two kinds of ways.
It could be like this.

84
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's say this is the insert.
Here's the ECO-R1.  I'll use this

85
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:31,000
sal 1 to orient us.
So, the bam site could either be

86
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:42,000
close over here.
Or it could be over on the other

87
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:50,000
side.  Does that make sense?
The logic is pretty simple.  How

88
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:58,000
can I tell which of those is correct?
Just doing the kind

89
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:07,000
of stuff I'm doing.
Beautiful, beautiful.

90
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:16,000
So if we cut with the sal 1 plus
the bam H1.  In one case,

91
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:25,000
one would get a fragment like that.
In the other case, get a fragment

92
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:32,000
like that.
That should feel uneasily familiar

93
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,000
to you.  It should feel just like
what we are doing what we did that

94
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,000
phage cross, and we had some genes
that were lined up.

95
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,000
And we were trying to figure,
was the orientation this way?  Or

96
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,000
was the orientation that?
That was exactly the same principle.

97
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,000
And so this is usually,
in the lab you'd call this

98
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,000
restriction mapping,
or making a restriction map.

99
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,000
And it enabled people to manipulate
fragments of DNA and make inferences

100
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,000
about their orientation and other
features before we can actually even

101
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,000
sequence DNA.
And that's just part of routine sort

102
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,000
of stuff you do a lab.
The equipment is disarmingly simple.

103
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,000
It looks something like that,
usually you're putting some colored

104
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,000
dye so you can see that the things
are moving down the gel.

105
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,000
And the way you visualize the DNA
is you add a molecule.

106
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,000
The name of it doesn't particularly
matter.  It's called ethidium

107
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,000
bromide.  But its property is it
doesn't fluoresce when it's just in

108
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,000
solution.  But it's a flat molecule,
and it can interpolate in between

109
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,000
the base pairs in DNA.
They have all those stacked base

110
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,000
pairs going down a helix.
This molecule's flat, edit likes to

111
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,000
slip inside.  And now it's a much
more hydrophobic environment.

112
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,000
It's hidden from the water, becomes
florescent.  And so,

113
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,000
DNA that's soaked up this dye then
will fluoresce when you put a UV

114
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,000
light on it.  So if I take the gel
out of there after I've run it,

115
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,000
and soak it in this dye and then
shine a little handheld UV light on

116
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,000
it, it would look something like
that if I photographed it.

117
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,000
And so, you would end up with those
patterns that look exactly like that.

118
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,000
Oops, I guess I took the other one
out.  But you can,

119
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,000
of course, depending on how
complicated it is,

120
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,000
you could have a lot of different
fragments.  OK,

121
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,000
so the next big thing that had to
happen in order for us to really

122
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,000
move to where we are in today's
molecular biology was somehow,

123
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,000
DNA had to be sequenced.
And as I say, when I was an

124
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,000
undergrad, or even when I was just
about to start,

125
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,000
when I was a postdoc anyway,
just again it seemed like how would

126
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,000
you ever do it?
Because every nucleotide was joint

127
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,000
by a phosphodiester bond.
The only difference was the base

128
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,000
that was there.
It seemed very, very difficult.

129
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,000
It was hard to imagine you would
ever be able to sort out the

130
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,000
sequence of a billion base pairs.
Of course, you could clone.  Now

131
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,000
you've got maybe a fragment of DNA
that's a couple hundred base pairs

132
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,000
long, and at least the problem
becomes smaller.

133
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,000
Maybe you could work it out.
Now, there were a couple of

134
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,000
different ways of doing it.
One was by Wally Gilbert, who's up

135
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,000
at Harvard who got half the Nobel
Prize for doing this.

136
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,000
The other principle, the other one
that's proved to be most generally

137
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,000
useful is Fred Sanger from England.
And he had Wally shared the Nobel

138
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,000
Prize for discovering sequencing.
And the principal was disarmingly

139
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,000
simple.  I think it's one of these
great ideas do you look back at

140
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,000
afterward and think,
I could have thought of that.

141
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,000
You guys already know everything
you need to invent how to sequence

142
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,000
DNA.  I've told you all
the stuff already.

143
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,000
But nobody's come down to tell me
that you've got it.

144
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:13,000
And I didn't think of it.
So here is the principal.  What

145
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,000
we've talked about,
if we take a DNA polymerase plus the

146
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:24,000
four deoxynucleotide triphosphate's,
remember we talked about

147
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,000
deoxyribonucleotide,
the adenosine triphosphate,

148
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:35,000
and so on.  There's four different
ones.

149
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:42,000
And we take a primer.
And there's a three prime hydroxyl

150
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:49,000
right there.  And so this is the
other strand is going the opposite

151
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:56,000
direction.  If we add that,
I think you all know what's going to

152
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:03,000
happen.  We're going to get an
extension to the other end.

153
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,000
And what happens every time we add a
nucleotide is that three prime

154
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,000
hydroxyl attacks the phosphate of
the triphosphate.

155
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,000
We lose two of the phosphates.
This is called pyrophosphate, and

156
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,000
we've created a new five to three
prime linkage.

157
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,000
That gives us a new three prime
hydroxyl, and we repeat the process,

158
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,000
right?  That's what we talked about.
So, what would happen,

159
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:46,000
let's spike in a little,
let me do it.  It's a little deoxy

160
00:13:46,100 --> 00:14:01,000
TTP.  So this is dideoxy.
But what would we mean by that?

161
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:07,000
Well, if this,
remember where the deoxy came from?

162
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:14,000
The ribose has at the two prime
position has a hydrogen instead of a

163
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,000
hydroxyl, and at the three prime
position it has a hydroxyl.

164
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:27,000
If we made a dideoxy, what we do is
we'd make that.  What could

165
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:33,000
that nucleotide do?
Well, as long as the polymerase

166
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:39,000
thought it was useful it would use
this end, it would have its

167
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:45,000
triphosphate up here.
So, somebody else's three prime OH

168
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:51,000
could come down and form a bond to
here and we'd lose this.

169
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:57,000
So it could get incorporated.
That chain is finished.  It can't

170
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:03,000
be elongated anymore.
So, let's think what would happen if

171
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:09,000
we had, let me stretch this out a
little bit here,

172
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:16,000
and let's imagine we had a few A's
in the sequence.

173
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:22,000
So, we are just going to spike it a
bit.  So, most of the things will

174
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:28,000
not see a dideoxy.
So, this primer will put,

175
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:34,000
we'll try elongating this.
So when we get to this point,

176
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,000
this point many of them will put it
an ordinary A,

177
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:45,000
but a few will put it a dideoxy.
And those will finish.  At that

178
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,000
point, they can't go any farther.
The rest of them keep going, [the

179
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,000
various?] nucleotides.
When we get to the next A,

180
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,000
most of them will put them a good T,
but the ones that put in a dideoxy

181
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:06,000
will stop, and they will generate a
fragment that looks like that.

182
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,000
You get the idea.
Out of this reaction,

183
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:17,000
we are going to get a set of
fragments.  And each one terminates

184
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,000
where there was an A up there.
Now, in this newer emulation of

185
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,000
this thing, we have a T.
And the trick is to put a dye that

186
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:35,000
you can attach to this nucleotide,
so it has a particular color.

187
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,000
So, suppose we had something that
was yellow.  Then this particular

188
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:47,000
set of fragments would be yellow.
And maybe you can begin to see what

189
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:54,000
would happen now.
If we did the same game three more

190
00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:00,000
times, each time using a different
deoxy, next time maybe

191
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:06,000
we'll use dideoxy A.
And we'll put a different colored

192
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,000
dye on it.  Then every time,
in this case we come to a T in the

193
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,000
template, it would stop,
and we'd get a little fragment

194
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,000
that's stopped because it
incorporated a dideoxy A,

195
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,000
and those would be, let's say,
green.  So, by the end of this,

196
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,000
we would have all possible fragments
if we mixed them all together and

197
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,000
the last nucleotide on each fragment
would say who it was by its color.

198
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,000
So, if you were to,
then, take this whole mixture of DNA

199
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,000
fragments and you run them down a
gel, in this case it's a difference

200
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,000
of polyacrylamide gel because you
have smaller trying to get things to

201
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,000
go by smaller fragments.
You could sort of see what would

202
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,000
happen.  The big ones would be at
the top.  The small ones would be at

203
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,000
the bottom.  And you'd see each band
would have a different color

204
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,000
depending on the dideoxy that
terminated its chain.

205
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,000
So, if you had a little scanner that
just goes along,

206
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,000
it can read this,
and it will print out something.

207
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,000
And these are always slightly
idealized.  This is a real one.

208
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,000
But this is the sort of stuff you
get back.  If you send a piece of

209
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,000
DNA over to a sequencing center,
they'd send this back as a file or

210
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,000
something.  And you'd sit there.
And it's very good these days.

211
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,000
The technology wasn't as good,
but they can almost always now get

212
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,000
the sequence.  Occasionally,
you'll get something like a run of

213
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,000
G's that gets a little hard,
but what they'll do is they'll sort

214
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,000
of what they call sequencing [bow
strands?].  You can see this way,

215
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,000
but really only looking at the
information of one strand.

216
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,000
So, if we took the other strand.
So if we took the other strand, and

217
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,000
we did the same thing,
but we should get the complementary

218
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,000
piece of information.
So, what this DNA sequencing allows

219
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,000
you to do, then,
is determine the exact sequence of

220
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,000
nucleotides in some kind of piece.
And much of the art from the rest of

221
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,000
it then comes,
how do you assemble all of those

222
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,000
things together?
In the case of a bacteria or

223
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,000
something, it wasn't so bad because
its DNA was small enough.

224
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,000
You could cut it into a bunch of
sort of big fragments,

225
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,000
and then take each one of those,
and then the sorting problem was

226
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,000
relatively simple.
In the case of something like

227
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,000
humans, it was really complicated
because there were

228
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,000
so much more DNA.
And the other thing is higher

229
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,000
organisms such as yourselves have a
lot of repeated DNA.

230
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,000
It's just the same sequence,
and sometimes there's quite a bit of

231
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,000
it, a bunch of repeats.
And so, if you see that at the end

232
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,000
of your thing,
you don't really quite know where

233
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,000
you are in the genome.
So a lot of other tricks had to be

234
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,000
brought into play,
including knowledge of the human

235
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,000
genetic map.  And so you could get
yourself anchored at various places

236
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,000
because you do on this particular
piece of DNA, because it was

237
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,000
associated with some gene,
had to be here on the chromosome.

238
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,000
And therefore,
things at least decide beside it

239
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,000
were there on the chromosome.
And there were a whole lot of

240
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,000
tricks to putting it together.
But the very basic principle of how

241
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,000
we sequence DNA has at its heart the
same process that I was talking to

242
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,000
you about as when we were doing DNA
replication, except in this case

243
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,000
it's just used in a very clever way.
And that was an amazing idea.

244
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,000
It got a Nobel Prize,
and you've been sitting here for the

245
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,000
last month with all the knowledge to
do it.  You keep emphasizing that

246
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,000
you've got to have that three prime
hydroxyl.  But some of the great

247
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,000
ideas often when you look back you
could see it was the hurdle was kind

248
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,000
of small.  And they didn't even have
to do this with dyes at the

249
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,000
beginning.  In fact,
that was a later innovation.

250
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,000
The key thing was just the
dideoxies stopping in each place.

251
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:11,000
I was lucky enough to live through
some of this, the development of

252
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:20,000
this technology.
OK, so I've got one more really big

253
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:28,000
thing to tell you,
which again was extraordinarily

254
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:37,000
clever, but extraordinarily simple
once you heard about it.

255
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:44,000
And it was one more technological
advance.  It wasn't a big insight

256
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:51,000
into biology in and of itself,
but it was a technology that opened

257
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:58,000
up just incredible experimental
possibilities.

258
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:05,000
And it's something known as the
polymerase chain reaction.

259
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:10,000
And this allows,
in principle, someone like me to go

260
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:15,000
and to grab a single cell from you,
take it to DNA, and get a copy of

261
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,000
any gene I want from your genome.
And I can look and see whether you

262
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:26,000
have any mutations in that genome,
or whether there are different

263
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,000
polymorphic alleles in the
population, in which one you've got

264
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:37,000
from your mom,
or which one you got from your dad.

265
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,000
So, you take from a single DNA
molecule, I can make as much as I

266
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,000
want.  And this is just like DNA
sequencing.  You guys already know

267
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,000
everything you need to know to
invent this technique as well.

268
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,000
It has very much that same property.
It's another one of these very

269
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,000
brilliant insights that you just had
to put things in the right place.

270
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,000
So let me explain the principle.

271
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,000
So, suppose that I would like to
know there's a gene that I know

272
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,000
there's a family history of
something, and I would like to know,

273
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,000
but I happen to get the allele that
carries that?  Or did I get the one

274
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,000
that didn't?  So,
in principle what I would like to do

275
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,000
is to get a hold of the piece of DNA
for that gene from my own cells.

276
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:33,000
But all I've started with is my
entire DNA.

277
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,000
Well, I could clone it.
I could make a recombinant library.

278
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,000
I could do everything else.  But
there's this other simple way.

279
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,000
And one way this involves, what it
involves taking,

280
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,000
is since I know the sequence of the
genome now, I know that almost

281
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,000
everything is going to the same.
There will be little differences

282
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,000
between individuals.
I'll make a little primer that

283
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,000
corresponds to the sequence that one
end of the gene,

284
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,000
and another primer that corresponds
to the DNA at the other end of the

285
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,000
gene, or whatever fragment
I want to use.

286
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,000
And that's all I have to do in terms
of getting anything made.

287
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:17,000
Now the rest, we are just going to
play games with DNA,

288
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:22,000
with DNA polymerase, and nucleoside
triphosphates,

289
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,000
just all the stuff I dragged you
through talking about DNA

290
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:32,000
replication.  So here's the idea.
So here's my DNA, let's say, or

291
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,000
part of it.
If I could actually see the sequence,

292
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,000
I would know, let's say,
the gene I'm interested in is in

293
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,000
here.  So, what I would do is make a
little primer.

294
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,000
It just has to be enough to confer
specificity for something with

295
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,000
humans.  If I make something
probably 30 nucleotides long,

296
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,000
that's enough.  It'll only bind one
place in the DNA.

297
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:03,000
And I make one, let's say,
for the opposite strand over here.

298
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:15,000
So remember, this is five prime,
three prime, five prime to three

299
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:27,000
prime.  So the principles will heat
to 95°C, and will denature the DNA.

300
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:39,000
And we'll add an excess of the two
primers.

301
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:46,000
And let's say we'll cool to 55°C,
or something.  And we'll cool it

302
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:53,000
down enough so that we can get the
primers on.  But we are not going to

303
00:25:53,100 --> 00:26:00,000
go all the way and let all the
strands find their way back.

304
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:08,000
And we'll add a DNA polymerase plus
four deoxy nucleoside

305
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:15,000
triphosphates.
Well, what will happen?

306
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:23,000
Well, here's one of the strands.
And we'll prime it here, let's say.

307
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:31,000
So, it will copy down here and go
as far as it can go.

308
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:38,000
And the other one starts here.
And it's going to go down all that

309
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,000
way.  Let's just repeat the whole
process now, OK?

310
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:50,000
What'll happen?  Now when we pull
them apart, we ought to have four

311
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:56,000
strands.  We'll have the original
ones here, and when I repeat the

312
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:02,000
process, the same thing's
going to happen again.

313
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:09,000
This one will go here,
and it will copy out.  This one will

314
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:17,000
go here.  It will copy out.
But what about this guy?  So,

315
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:24,000
this one becomes this one here.
So the primer that it does will

316
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:32,000
copy it, and it can't
go any further.

317
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:37,000
I just generated a piece that's
exactly what I wanted.

318
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:43,000
And the same deal here: as long as
I don't get lost,

319
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:48,000
which what did I do?
So, we've got this guy here.

320
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:54,000
So, it starts there.  So this one
becomes this one,

321
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:59,000
and we'll prime it here.
It'll go along and it will stop.

322
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:05,000
So there's the complementary strand
to the one here.

323
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,000
And I think this is sort of like
doing a math problem.

324
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,000
You can't just look at it and say,
we'll maybe you will get it.  But

325
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:19,000
there's nothing like sitting down
with a pencil and paper,

326
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:24,000
and take yourself through several
cycles.  What you will believe is

327
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:29,000
how quickly you get to get being
nothing but, almost nothing,

328
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,000
but the sequence that you are trying
to amplify.

329
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,000
And so, this again has an
astonishing effect.

330
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,000
This is why you hear about DNA
testing all the time in forensics,

331
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,000
because you can take a tiny bit of
DNA from saliva,

332
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,000
or semen, or blood,
or whatever they might find on a

333
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,000
crime scene, and then they can
amplify little pieces

334
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,000
and they compare.
And there's a trick they use in

335
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:03,000
forensics, and that is that there
are sequences within the human

336
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,000
genome where the little variable
repeats like GT,

337
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,000
GT, GT, GT, GT, GT,
and I might have 14 of them in one

338
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:18,000
of my chromosomes.
The one I got from my mom might

339
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:23,000
have 40.  You might have 24 and
something else,

340
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,000
and so on.  If you were to do PCR
around a little region that was

341
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,000
known to be variable,
if you had 14 repeats you'd get a

342
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:38,000
shorter fragment.
And if you had 40 repeats,

343
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,000
you get a longer fragment.  So,
I'll come back to that in a sec.

344
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,000
So, if you were to, for example,
take something with a long [repeat

345
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,000
and a?] short peak into this kind of
thing.  We get two fragments,

346
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,000
say, one from the paternal.  And if
you do this with several such sites

347
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:01,000
around the genome,
pretty soon you run into situations

348
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,000
where the odds of a particular
combination of a long one at the

349
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,000
site, a short one at the site,
and so on, becomes statistically

350
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:15,000
improbable that it's anyone
other than yourself.

351
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,000
So on a crime scene,
if they did this, they,

352
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,000
for example, might have three
individuals that they were thinking

353
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,000
was possible.  And they'd generate
patterns like this,

354
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,000
say, using three different loci like
this, and then have the

355
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,000
forensic sample.
And it was pretty evident who didn't

356
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,000
do it, and who at least remains a
suspect.  This probably would

357
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,000
improve it.  The very last thing,
just to close us off, is when people

358
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,000
develop this PCR technique,
you had to sit there with your

359
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,000
pipette because every time you
raised it to 90° to denature the DNA

360
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,000
you killed your enzyme.
So, you cool it down to 55,

361
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,000
escort it in a new DNA polymerase.
And then someone finally said,

362
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,000
another brilliant idea,
what if I had a thermoresistant

363
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,000
polymerase?  Where would
I find those?

364
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,000
Well, Penny was talking to you about
those events where it's really,

365
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,000
really hot, and those black smokers
and everything,

366
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,000
so maybe you got a bacterium from
their.  It would have a temperature

367
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,000
resistant polymerase.
So here you are from the New

368
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,000
England [Biocatalog?
, [vent exominus?] DNA polymerase,

369
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,000
deep vent DNA polymerase.  People
went to grab those bacteria from

370
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,000
there, grabbed the DNA polymerase
gene.  And now,

371
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,000
the DNA polymerase just sits there.
It just laughs and you bring it up

372
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,000
to 90°.
And when you cool it back down and

373
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,000
give it a substrate again,
it will do its thing.  And so,

374
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,000
this whole thing can be done
automatic and you don't have to sit

375
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,000
there and pipette something in at
the end of every run,

376
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:52,000
another little cute sort of
engineering trick that combined

377
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,000
ecology together with biology.
OK, see you on Friday.
