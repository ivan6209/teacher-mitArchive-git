1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
Let's get started.
So I'm going to finish up energy

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:09
today.  And then we're going to
begin sort of section more or less

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:14
we'll call it molecular biology but
it's sort of dealing with the issues

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:19
that revolve around the discovery
that DNA was the genetic material

5
00:00:19 --> 00:00:24
and then working through how people
understood how information got from

6
00:00:24 --> 00:00:29
the DNA into everything else,
how things were regulated.

7
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
There are an incredibly large number
of important discoveries that form

8
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
the foundation of how we think about
biology that are going to come out

9
00:00:36 --> 00:00:40
in this next section,
but before I do that I just want to

10
00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
finish up this section that I talked
to you about, about energy.

11
00:00:44 --> 00:00:48
And I hope as we go along here
you're going to see how some of

12
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
these sort of disparate parts of the
course begin to come together.

13
00:00:52 --> 00:00:56
Almost everything we're going to be
talking about now is going to be

14
00:00:56 --> 00:01:00
needing energy such as replicating
DNA or making proteins and

15
00:01:00 --> 00:01:04
all sorts of things.
And those are driven ultimately by

16
00:01:04 --> 00:01:09
ATP.  And what I've been trying to
talk to about for the last lecture

17
00:01:09 --> 00:01:14
or two is how the cell gets the ATP,
the energy money that it needs to

18
00:01:14 --> 00:01:19
make things.  We talked through
glycolysis, this ancient,

19
00:01:19 --> 00:01:24
ancient way of getting a couple of
ATPs out of a molecule of sugar so

20
00:01:24 --> 00:01:29
well-imbedded in our genetic makeup
it's in almost all organisms.

21
00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
And then I talked last lecture about
this other principle which must have

22
00:01:33 --> 00:01:37
come up very, very early in
evolution.  Again,

23
00:01:37 --> 00:01:42
it's used by all organisms.
And that's the principle of

24
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
capturing the energy that's inherent
in a proton gradient across a

25
00:01:46 --> 00:01:51
membrane.  And I talked to you then
about the idea then the way it

26
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
worked was that the cell would have
something in its membrane that would

27
00:01:55 --> 00:01:59
be a proton pump and it would pump
the proton from one side of the

28
00:01:59 --> 00:02:04
membrane to the other.
So it's working against the gradient.

29
00:02:04 --> 00:02:09
So it's doing energy.
So there are a couple of different

30
00:02:09 --> 00:02:14
ways energy needs to be provided.
It could be provided by some kind

31
00:02:14 --> 00:02:19
of light energy,
and that's what drives

32
00:02:19 --> 00:02:24
photosynthesis.
I'll say a few words about that.

33
00:02:24 --> 00:02:29
Or in the case of respiration with
the oxidative phosphorylation,

34
00:02:29 --> 00:02:34
I showed you how it was the
electrons sort of descend in

35
00:02:34 --> 00:02:39
stepwise fashion down from
one state to another.

36
00:02:39 --> 00:02:44
There's energy given off,
free energy is available, and that

37
00:02:44 --> 00:02:50
can be used to power the pump.
And once the proton gradient is

38
00:02:50 --> 00:02:56
made then the cells can turn it
around and use the energy that's in

39
00:02:56 --> 00:03:01
that proton gradient to make ATP.
So in respiration remember the trick

40
00:03:01 --> 00:03:05
was then to take those two pyruvates,
burn them all the way down to carbon

41
00:03:05 --> 00:03:10
dioxide and water,
make as many ATPs and NADHs as you

42
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14
could, then take the NADHs,
use them to make a proton gradient

43
00:03:14 --> 00:03:19
and eventually,
if you will, convert everything into

44
00:03:19 --> 00:03:23
ATP so you've got it as energy.
Our cells do it.  That part,

45
00:03:23 --> 00:03:28
respiration and the oxidative
phosphorylation is done in

46
00:03:28 --> 00:03:32
mitochondria, which I said sort of
came from bacteria that were

47
00:03:32 --> 00:03:37
captured at some point.
Here's a picture of a mitochondrion.

48
00:03:37 --> 00:03:41
It still looks more or less like a
bacterium.  And I showed you the

49
00:03:41 --> 00:03:46
little parts that are in there.
It was funny.  Right after lecture

50
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
I went back to my lab.
I picked up a recent issue of

51
00:03:50 --> 00:03:55
Science.  And I opened up to a page
that said something about rats that

52
00:03:55 --> 00:04:00
had been bred to be very poor at
aerobic exercise.

53
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
And it went on to talk about the
health problems they had.

54
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
And there was a sentence in there
that they think the underlying cause

55
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
is by breeding these rats and
selection four rats that are poor at

56
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
doing aerobic exercise.
What they think it all stems from

57
00:04:14 --> 00:04:17
is having very inefficient
mitochondria that don't work nearly

58
00:04:17 --> 00:04:21
as well.  And that would make a lot
of sense.  I was going to scan that

59
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
article but we had some technical
issues this morning.

60
00:04:24 --> 00:04:28
Maybe I can show it to you next
lecture.  OK.

61
00:04:28 --> 00:04:32
So the one last thing then that I
want to do is I want to say a few

62
00:04:32 --> 00:04:37
words about photosynthesis because
that actually preceded respiration.

63
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
Respiration couldn't evolve until
there was oxygen in the atmosphere.

64
00:04:41 --> 00:04:46
So probably the first use or
certainly one of the first uses of

65
00:04:46 --> 00:04:51
the proton gradient happened in this
scale of evolution and put here

66
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
somewhere maybe 3.
billion years ago or so when what I

67
00:04:55 --> 00:05:04
had called photosynthesis --

68
00:05:04 --> 00:05:09
-- release I on day one in the sort
of trivial fashion.  This

69
00:05:09 --> 00:05:16
is known as cyclic --

70
00:05:16 --> 00:05:22
-- photo phosphorylation.
And the principle is relatively

71
00:05:22 --> 00:05:29
simple.  It's to capture the energy
in sunlight --

72
00:05:29 --> 00:05:37
-- to make a proton gradient.

73
00:05:37 --> 00:05:43
And that then can be used, as you
now know, to make ATP.

74
00:05:43 --> 00:05:50
So in order to capture energy from
sunlight nature had to evolve

75
00:05:50 --> 00:05:56
molecules that are able to observe
in the appropriate wavelength

76
00:05:56 --> 00:06:01
range.
You know the names of those

77
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
molecules.  Chlorophyll,
the come in two principle species.

78
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
You don't have to remember the
structure.  What you can see is a

79
00:06:08 --> 00:06:12
lot of conjugated double-bonds.
That's how you sort of tune the

80
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
absorption of a molecule.
If you want to make it absorb a

81
00:06:15 --> 00:06:19
longer and longer wavelength you
start hooking together double bonds.

82
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
And you can set it up sort of you
can get a molecule to absorb at just

83
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
about any maximum absorption,
any wavelength you want.  So

84
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
chlorophyll is able to
absorb this energy.

85
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
And the principle of this is what
happens.  You have this chlorophyll

86
00:06:34 --> 00:06:39
and it absorbs a photon.
And an electron gets excited so it

87
00:06:39 --> 00:06:44
basically moves to another orbital.
It's farther away from the nucleus.

88
00:06:44 --> 00:06:49
It's easier now for that electron
to get lost than it was before.

89
00:06:49 --> 00:06:54
Now, if nothing was happening that
electron would eventually just fall

90
00:06:54 --> 00:06:59
down to its ground state and you'd
lose all the energy as heat.

91
00:06:59 --> 00:07:05
So what happens in photosynthesis,
though, is that the electron falls

92
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
back down to the ground state again
in a series of steps.

93
00:07:11 --> 00:07:17
And how this happens,
electrons are basically getting

94
00:07:17 --> 00:07:23
passed from one carrier to another.
And the same principle as we saw in

95
00:07:23 --> 00:07:29
respiration applies in that at each
phase in here a proton is pumped.

96
00:07:29 --> 00:07:35
Now, the out and the in are reversed
from what it says in respiration.

97
00:07:35 --> 00:07:41
You have notes on respiration, or
should anyway.

98
00:07:41 --> 00:07:48
But the in and the out,
as you'll see, it's sort of an

99
00:07:48 --> 00:07:54
arbitrary.  You sort of take a frame
of reference and then something's in

100
00:07:54 --> 00:07:59
and something's out.
The point is that in both of them

101
00:07:59 --> 00:08:03
protons go from one side of the
membrane to the other and you get

102
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
more on one side,
you pump them in one direction and

103
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
they flow back in the other.
And the in and the out is sort of

104
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
an arbitrary way of describing
what's happening,

105
00:08:15 --> 00:08:19
but in both cases the key thing is
that you're pumping electrons out.

106
00:08:19 --> 00:08:23
And then these can be used to make
ATP, as we talked about with ATP

107
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
synthesis.  In this case the
electrons eventually end up back on

108
00:08:27 --> 00:08:30
the chlorophyll.
And so that's why it's called cyclic

109
00:08:30 --> 00:08:34
phosphorylation.
What you get out of this,

110
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
as you can see, is ATP.  So this was
probably a really big deal in

111
00:08:37 --> 00:08:41
evolution because the current
thinking is perhaps there was an RNA

112
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
world that's still sort of being
debated.  At some point it's clear

113
00:08:44 --> 00:08:48
that somewhere around 3.
billion years or so something that

114
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
looks sort of like a present-day
bacterium arose,

115
00:08:51 --> 00:08:55
probably eight molecules that had
already been made in the sort of

116
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
primordial soup,
but when those started to run out

117
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
then it needed other ways
of making energy.

118
00:09:02 --> 00:09:07
It needed other ways of making
carbon.  Here's a way of getting

119
00:09:07 --> 00:09:12
energy, but what's available to make
more organic molecules is only

120
00:09:12 --> 00:09:17
carbon dioxide.
And if you remember that little

121
00:09:17 --> 00:09:22
thing I showed you of if we're going
from a methyl to a hydroxyl to an

122
00:09:22 --> 00:09:29
aldehyde to an acid --

123
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
-- to CO2, that direction is
oxidation and that direction is

124
00:09:33 --> 00:09:38
reduction.  So if we go in that
direction and we end up generating

125
00:09:38 --> 00:09:42
NADH because we're taking electrons
and giving them to something else,

126
00:09:42 --> 00:09:47
if we want to go the other way if
we're starting with C02 what we need

127
00:09:47 --> 00:09:52
to do is we need to have a supply of
reducing power so we can take the

128
00:09:52 --> 00:09:56
C02 and get it down to all the
less-oxidized states that are

129
00:09:56 --> 00:10:01
necessary for building all the
molecules that we've

130
00:10:01 --> 00:10:06
been talking about.
So making ATP was a great idea,

131
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
but the cell still needed to have
some form of reducing agent.

132
00:10:10 --> 00:10:15
And what they used was they used
hydrogen sulfide.

133
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19
This is at least one of the major
ways that it was done.

134
00:10:19 --> 00:10:24
And so there is a very slight twist
here.  This is NADP.

135
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
It's the same molecule as NAD
except there's an extra

136
00:10:28 --> 00:10:33
phosphorylation.
And the one with the phosphate on it

137
00:10:33 --> 00:10:37
tends to be used in biosynthetic
reactions, but otherwise it's

138
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
exactly the same thing.
It's an electron banking thing.

139
00:10:41 --> 00:10:45
And what this gave was NADPH plus
sulfur plus a hydrogen.

140
00:10:45 --> 00:10:50
So sulfur is a waste product.
Here's the reducing power.  Here's

141
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
the ATP.  That's what those
organisms need to be able to

142
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
synthesize new organic material
without having to have

143
00:10:58 --> 00:11:03
pre-made molecules.
A really big deal in evolution.

144
00:11:03 --> 00:11:07
And the idea for making ATP is
based on this use of establishing a

145
00:11:07 --> 00:11:12
proton gradient,
the same principle we've seen again.

146
00:11:12 --> 00:11:17
Now, there's another possible
source of reducing power,

147
00:11:17 --> 00:11:21
and that would be to use water as
the source of the reducing power.

148
00:11:21 --> 00:11:26
But in order to do that you've got
to put more energy into it.

149
00:11:26 --> 00:11:31
And this system wasn't able to
handle it.

150
00:11:31 --> 00:11:43
But that happened soon enough with
the development of what I called on

151
00:11:43 --> 00:11:55
the first day photosynthesis release
II, which is technically known as

152
00:11:55 --> 00:12:04
noncyclic photophosphorylation.
Again, it uses the energy of

153
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
sunlight.  But the twist this time,
it not only makes ATP, it also makes

154
00:12:08 --> 00:12:13
NADPH, it makes reducing power at
the same time.

155
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
So you can see that is a really
major advance.

156
00:12:17 --> 00:12:22
If you can use sunlight to make
both of them now you're really

157
00:12:22 --> 00:12:26
efficient.  So this is how this one
works.  It's related

158
00:12:26 --> 00:12:31
to the other one.
And the first part is more or less

159
00:12:31 --> 00:12:36
the same idea.
A photon is absorbed by a molecule

160
00:12:36 --> 00:12:42
of chlorophyll.
It kicks the chlorophyll up to an

161
00:12:42 --> 00:12:47
activated state where the electrons
are at a higher orbital far away.

162
00:12:47 --> 00:12:52
It wants to come back down.  Energy
is going to be released.

163
00:12:52 --> 00:12:58
So electrons gets passed,
protons get pumped from one side of

164
00:12:58 --> 00:13:04
a membrane to another.
Except this time,

165
00:13:04 --> 00:13:10
instead of coming back this lands in
a different chlorophyll that has

166
00:13:10 --> 00:13:16
just recently lost a pair of
electrons.  But there's a new energy

167
00:13:16 --> 00:13:22
input here that kicks this
chlorophyll up to an even higher

168
00:13:22 --> 00:13:28
energy state than this one.
And as these electrons start to

169
00:13:28 --> 00:13:34
come down the energy hill there's
enough energy here to take a

170
00:13:34 --> 00:13:40
molecule of NADP+ plus a hydrogen
ion and give NADPH.

171
00:13:40 --> 00:13:46
There's one thing that this isn't
going to work like a cycle or a

172
00:13:46 --> 00:13:53
machine yet.  Anybody see what
hasn't been taken care of yet?

173
00:13:53 --> 00:14:00
Say again.  Send the electrons back
to this chlorophyll, exactly.

174
00:14:00 --> 00:14:05
However, the way the energetics are
structured now the cells were able

175
00:14:05 --> 00:14:10
to take reducing power from here and
generate 2H+ plus a half of an

176
00:14:10 --> 00:14:16
oxygen molecule.
And this would really be two waters

177
00:14:16 --> 00:14:21
giving four hydrogens and one oxygen
molecule.  So what you can see here

178
00:14:21 --> 00:14:27
now, there are a couple of really
important things about this.

179
00:14:27 --> 00:14:33
It needs more energy.
It makes ATP and NADPH which leaves

180
00:14:33 --> 00:14:41
the cell able to carry out
biosynthesis.  And the third thing,

181
00:14:41 --> 00:14:48
which is an incredible influence on
our planet, it started to generate

182
00:14:48 --> 00:14:56
oxygen as a waste product.
And it's really a mixed blessing.

183
00:14:56 --> 00:15:01
I mean oxygen is very reactive.
It damages our DNA.

184
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
It damages our proteins.
We have an amazing number of

185
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
defenses against oxygen.
But, on the other hand, as it

186
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
accumulated in the atmosphere and
organisms slowly over evolutionary

187
00:15:11 --> 00:15:15
time learned to deal with it,
it then set us up for the

188
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
possibility of respiration which,
as you can see, is 18 times more

189
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
efficient than in that ancient way
of using glycolysis to make energy

190
00:15:21 --> 00:15:25
out of sugars.
So that's more or less the story.

191
00:15:25 --> 00:15:29
This part is called photosystem II.

192
00:15:29 --> 00:15:34
This assembly of stuff is
photosystem I.

193
00:15:34 --> 00:15:39
And I just wanted to show you this
next slide because chlorophyll isn't

194
00:15:39 --> 00:15:44
just floating around like this.
As you might guess, it's bound into

195
00:15:44 --> 00:15:49
proteins and things.
And someone has figured out the

196
00:15:49 --> 00:15:54
structure of photosystem I.
It consists of 12 proteins,

197
00:15:54 --> 00:16:00
96 chlorophylls and about 30 other
molecules.

198
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04
And what it really does is it
functions as an antenna.

199
00:16:04 --> 00:16:08
Some of the other molecules can
absorb it at wavelengths that are

200
00:16:08 --> 00:16:12
different from chlorophyll.
And all the energy gets funneled

201
00:16:12 --> 00:16:16
into the chlorophyll and into this
process.  And you'll probably

202
00:16:16 --> 00:16:20
recognize by now that proteins here
we're seeing alpha helices and beta

203
00:16:20 --> 00:16:24
sheets in here as part of this
structure.  So the first organisms

204
00:16:24 --> 00:16:28
that learned how to do this were
organisms we now know

205
00:16:28 --> 00:16:32
as cyanobacteria.
They're a kind of bacteria that has

206
00:16:32 --> 00:16:36
two membranes like E.
coli and like the other ones that

207
00:16:36 --> 00:16:41
we've talked about.
You're familiar with these.

208
00:16:41 --> 00:16:45
There's the green scum you see on
ponds.  Here's a close-up.

209
00:16:45 --> 00:16:50
Sometimes they grow as filaments,
the cells in a chain.  You notice

210
00:16:50 --> 00:16:54
they're green.
They're making chlorophyll.

211
00:16:54 --> 00:16:59
And what happened in plants was
that apparently something probably

212
00:16:59 --> 00:17:03
related to the present-day
cyanobacteria got trapped inside

213
00:17:03 --> 00:17:08
some early progenitor of what we now
know as plants and green algae.

214
00:17:08 --> 00:17:15
And this trapped bacterium became a
chloroplast.  And it had all the

215
00:17:15 --> 00:17:23
machinery necessary to carry out
this noncyclic photophosphorylation.

216
00:17:23 --> 00:17:31
The structure of these things,
there's an outer membrane.

217
00:17:31 --> 00:17:35
Just similar to what I told you for
the mitochondria.

218
00:17:35 --> 00:17:40
There's an inner membrane.
And what's special about the

219
00:17:40 --> 00:17:45
mitochondrion then,
there's another membrane inside

220
00:17:45 --> 00:17:54
that's known as the thylocoid.

221
00:17:54 --> 00:18:00
And that's where all the chlorophyll
is.  And the reason the out and the

222
00:18:00 --> 00:18:07
in is a little bit confusing in here
is this part, which is probably the

223
00:18:07 --> 00:18:14
cytoplasm of the old bacterium,
is pumped from what's known as the

224
00:18:14 --> 00:18:21
stroma of a chloroplast which is
equivalent to the cytoplasm of the

225
00:18:21 --> 00:18:27
original bacteria into the lumen.
So the chlorophyll that's in this

226
00:18:27 --> 00:18:32
membrane absorbs the light,
pumps protons into the lumen

227
00:18:32 --> 00:18:37
building up a proton gradient,
and then they flow back out in the

228
00:18:37 --> 00:18:42
other direction and make ATP.
Here's a picture of a chloroplast

229
00:18:42 --> 00:18:47
once again.  It looks an awful lot
like the bacterium still that got

230
00:18:47 --> 00:18:52
captured.  All this stuff on the
inside, those are the thylocoid

231
00:18:52 --> 00:18:57
membranes that carry out this
specialized stuff.  So

232
00:18:57 --> 00:19:01
there you have it.
That's how cells,

233
00:19:01 --> 00:19:05
the major ways that life has figured
out how to make energy.

234
00:19:05 --> 00:19:08
When Penny Chisholm starts to talk
to you she'll talk to you about how

235
00:19:08 --> 00:19:12
organisms adapt to various niches,
things that live in the bottom of

236
00:19:12 --> 00:19:15
the ocean, things that live in
various places.

237
00:19:15 --> 00:19:19
They all have to make energy.
Well, they all use some variation

238
00:19:19 --> 00:19:22
on these principles I've talked to
you about.  And she'll then show you

239
00:19:22 --> 00:19:26
how they're very cleaver at
extracting energy out of all sorts

240
00:19:26 --> 00:19:30
of things by applying these
principles in different ways.

241
00:19:30 --> 00:19:34
OK.  So what we're going to start
doing now is we're going to start

242
00:19:34 --> 00:19:39
talking about DNA.
This is certainly a molecule that's

243
00:19:39 --> 00:19:43
fascinated me all my life.
You should know from the first part

244
00:19:43 --> 00:19:48
that it's built up of units known as
nucleotides that have a sugar.

245
00:19:48 --> 00:19:53
It's a ribose sugar that's missing
one hydroxyl so it's a deoxyribose.

246
00:19:53 --> 00:19:57
The sugars are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4,
5.  I showed you that.  They'll be a

247
00:19:57 --> 00:20:02
phosphate.
And then one of these nucleic acid

248
00:20:02 --> 00:20:06
bases, either a pyrimidine or a
purine.  And in DNA you find the

249
00:20:06 --> 00:20:11
pyrimidine bases are cytosine and
thiamine.  And in DNA the purine

250
00:20:11 --> 00:20:15
bases are adenine and guanine.
And then these subunits are

251
00:20:15 --> 00:20:20
polymerized together.
In essence, splitting out water to

252
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
give you a polymer.
And I didn't emphasize this too

253
00:20:24 --> 00:20:29
strong the first time
I showed it to you.

254
00:20:29 --> 00:20:33
It's going to become a very big deal
over the next few lectures as we

255
00:20:33 --> 00:20:37
begin to consider how nature had to
figure out how to replicate DNA and

256
00:20:37 --> 00:20:42
all sorts of implications to go
along with this,

257
00:20:42 --> 00:20:46
but there's a polarity to a strand
of DNA.  This is what's called the 5

258
00:20:46 --> 00:20:51
prime sugar.  The primes indicate
the numbers referring to the sugar,

259
00:20:51 --> 00:20:55
and the ones without primes are
referring to numbers of atoms that

260
00:20:55 --> 00:21:00
make up part of the nucleic
acid base.

261
00:21:00 --> 00:21:04
So if we're looking at a chain,
this is a 5 prime carbon of the

262
00:21:04 --> 00:21:09
sugar, that's the 3 prime.
And so what you can see, this bond

263
00:21:09 --> 00:21:14
which is really a phosphodiester
bond, the phosphate group has formed

264
00:21:14 --> 00:21:19
an ester with this hydroxyl and with
the hydroxyl that used to be here.

265
00:21:19 --> 00:21:24
So it's a phosphodiester bond and
it's a 5 prime,

266
00:21:24 --> 00:21:29
3 prime bond.  It joins the 5 prime
carbon to the 3 prime

267
00:21:29 --> 00:21:33
carbon up here.
So that means if you're looking at a

268
00:21:33 --> 00:21:37
chain of DNA, if you come down this
way you're coming in the 5 to 3

269
00:21:37 --> 00:21:41
prime direction.
If we come up the other way we're

270
00:21:41 --> 00:21:45
coming from the 3 prime end heading
towards the 5 prime end.

271
00:21:45 --> 00:21:48
So you'll see me saying 5 prime,
3 prime.  Now, as I told you, the

272
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
principle force that holds the
strands of the DNA together are

273
00:21:52 --> 00:21:56
hydrogen bonds,
three of them between a G and a C

274
00:21:56 --> 00:22:00
and two of them between
an A and a T.

275
00:22:00 --> 00:22:04
And then they are a pair of strands.
And they're actually running in

276
00:22:04 --> 00:22:08
opposite polarities.
This is something to contend with

277
00:22:08 --> 00:22:12
when we think about replication.
5 prime to 3 prime in one direction

278
00:22:12 --> 00:22:16
and 5 prime to 3 prime going in the
opposite way here.

279
00:22:16 --> 00:22:21
And then, as you all know,
it's called the double helix.

280
00:22:21 --> 00:22:25
So it's actually not flat like this
in space.  It's in a 3-dimensional

281
00:22:25 --> 00:22:29
twisted into a double helix and the
base pairs are held together by

282
00:22:29 --> 00:22:33
hydrogen bonds between the bases on
the opposite strands down the middle

283
00:22:33 --> 00:22:37
of the molecule.
And I like this little movie I

284
00:22:37 --> 00:22:41
showed you because you can see it
pretty well.  The nitrogens are blue.

285
00:22:41 --> 00:22:44
It's easy to see the bases.
And the hydrogen bonds are right in

286
00:22:44 --> 00:22:48
the middle.  There's another force I
didn't mention and it doesn't matter

287
00:22:48 --> 00:22:51
for this course,
but when the bases sort of stack on

288
00:22:51 --> 00:22:55
top of each other there's actually a
kind of extra stabilization that

289
00:22:55 --> 00:22:58
comes from that.
It's a gorgeous molecule.

290
00:22:58 --> 00:23:02
You all know it encodes the genetic
information.

291
00:23:02 --> 00:23:05
We're going to be talking about it a
lot, but first thing,

292
00:23:05 --> 00:23:09
you know, I could just tell you it's
the genetic information.

293
00:23:09 --> 00:23:13
But one of the really big
discoveries in biology was that DNA

294
00:23:13 --> 00:23:16
is the genetic information.
And a point I'm trying to help you

295
00:23:16 --> 00:23:20
learn here, you know,
I'm trying to teach you more than

296
00:23:20 --> 00:23:24
just facts.  And I hope some of you
at least will catch that.

297
00:23:24 --> 00:23:28
I'm trying to show you how biology
is done.

298
00:23:28 --> 00:23:31
As an experimental scientist you
don't sit down usually and figure it

299
00:23:31 --> 00:23:34
out.  Instead you start doing
experiments and you get all kinds of

300
00:23:34 --> 00:23:38
unexpected discoveries.
And, in general, as people work in

301
00:23:38 --> 00:23:41
these unexpected discoveries
ultimately they come to these grand

302
00:23:41 --> 00:23:45
new insights that,
you know, sometimes would have been

303
00:23:45 --> 00:23:48
very hard to forget.
So the real question that people

304
00:23:48 --> 00:23:52
wondered for a long time,
and we'll talk more about the

305
00:23:52 --> 00:23:55
history of genetics,
but people knew we clearly had

306
00:23:55 --> 00:23:59
inheritable traits.
You could see it in your kids.

307
00:23:59 --> 00:24:03
People had been breeding plants and
all sorts of things.

308
00:24:03 --> 00:24:07
Breeding domestic animals.
They sort of understood the

309
00:24:07 --> 00:24:11
principle of inheritance.
When I tell you about Mendel we'll

310
00:24:11 --> 00:24:15
begin to see how his thinking led to
the idea that the inheritance wasn't

311
00:24:15 --> 00:24:19
just sort of like a liquid where
everything mixed together.

312
00:24:19 --> 00:24:23
It came in units or particles which
we know of as genes.

313
00:24:23 --> 00:24:27
And so the idea that genes had been
accepted certainly by the beginning

314
00:24:27 --> 00:24:31
of this century anyway,
but nobody knew what they were made

315
00:24:31 --> 00:24:37
of.  They were made of --
The major properties that they had

316
00:24:37 --> 00:24:44
was they clearly encoded information
in some way.

317
00:24:44 --> 00:24:50
They must replicate because one cell

318
00:24:50 --> 00:24:54
could give two and on and on and on.
So if you were going to pass it

319
00:24:54 --> 00:24:58
down in an inherited way they have
to be replicated.

320
00:24:58 --> 00:25:01
And the third thing was that people
knew somehow they could mutate or

321
00:25:01 --> 00:25:05
the information content that they
encoded could be changed.

322
00:25:05 --> 00:25:09
Again, you could see that,
that you'd get something, an altered

323
00:25:09 --> 00:25:13
characteristic,
and then it would be propagated down

324
00:25:13 --> 00:25:16
through that line.
That was the principle of breeding

325
00:25:16 --> 00:25:20
that people had done for ages.
And so they understood that.  There

326
00:25:20 --> 00:25:24
was one other key thing they knew.
They knew that these genes were in

327
00:25:24 --> 00:25:28
the nucleus.  And I'll tell you the
full story of how even that insight

328
00:25:28 --> 00:25:32
was arrived at.
But I'll just show you for the

329
00:25:32 --> 00:25:36
moment this little movie.
This shows some chromosomes that

330
00:25:36 --> 00:25:40
are all bunched up and are just
pulled apart at the time of the cell

331
00:25:40 --> 00:25:44
division.  Those chromosomes,
as we now know, are made of DNA.

332
00:25:44 --> 00:25:48
But in essence what people had seen
through the microscope was these

333
00:25:48 --> 00:25:52
chromosomes or colored things that
they could stain.

334
00:25:52 --> 00:25:56
They could sort of see something
had doubled.  And just before the

335
00:25:56 --> 00:26:01
cell divided the two sets separated
and each cell got a new set.

336
00:26:01 --> 00:26:05
So that's about what people knew.
They had those properties.  They're

337
00:26:05 --> 00:26:10
in the nucleus.
They knew about as much as you do.

338
00:26:10 --> 00:26:15
They knew the major classes of
biomolecules in a cell.

339
00:26:15 --> 00:26:20
So what do you think you would need
to do to show that DNA is the

340
00:26:20 --> 00:26:25
genetic material,
encodes the genes?

341
00:26:25 --> 00:26:30
Find somebody near you.
I'll give you a minute or so.

342
00:26:30 --> 00:26:32
I'd like to hear what kind of ideas
you come up with.

343
00:26:32 --> 00:26:35
Then I'll tell you how it happened.
But I want to hear.  Why don't you

344
00:26:35 --> 00:26:37
think about it and just see if you
can come up with a couple ideas for

345
00:26:37 --> 00:27:13
me, what you'd need to figure out.

346
00:27:13 --> 00:27:17
Well, let's just see what kind of
ideas anybody got.

347
00:27:17 --> 00:27:21
If you wanted to make me believe
that DNA is doing that,

348
00:27:21 --> 00:27:25
or I think it's a protein for the
moment, that's what I think is most

349
00:27:25 --> 00:27:30
likely, but what you do think?
Anybody got an idea?

350
00:27:30 --> 00:27:36
Mess up the DNA and see if we can
mess up the cell.

351
00:27:36 --> 00:27:42
How are we going to do that?
I can break a cell open and I guess

352
00:27:42 --> 00:27:48
I can purify DNA and I can analyze
it.  And it's got four bases in it

353
00:27:48 --> 00:27:54
and it's got sugars and phosphates.
At that point nobody could sequence

354
00:27:54 --> 00:28:00
DNA.  We didn't even
know the structure.

355
00:28:00 --> 00:28:04
Yeah?  Take it out of one cell and
put it into another.

356
00:28:04 --> 00:28:08
And what would you expect to happen
then?

357
00:28:08 --> 00:28:17
OK.  That's a really nice idea.

358
00:28:17 --> 00:28:21
Somehow if you took the DNA and
moved it from one cell to another

359
00:28:21 --> 00:28:26
that the characteristic of this cell
would be somehow carried

360
00:28:26 --> 00:28:31
over.  OK.
That's in fact the way it happened

361
00:28:31 --> 00:28:35
but not as simply as that,
as I'll tell you, but that's exactly

362
00:28:35 --> 00:28:39
the essence of it.
One little problem.

363
00:28:39 --> 00:28:43
Maybe we'll see if anybody has a
thought on this.

364
00:28:43 --> 00:28:47
If I purify DNA,
I mean nothing's ever really pure,

365
00:28:47 --> 00:28:51
right?  You get it out and there's
always little bits of stuff.

366
00:28:51 --> 00:28:55
And someone can always argue,
well, yeah, it's 99% DNA, but it's

367
00:28:55 --> 00:29:00
the other bits you cannot
get rid of.  Yeah?

368
00:29:00 --> 00:29:03
If you used radioactive material,
how is that going to help us?

369
00:29:03 --> 00:29:13
It does contain nitrogen.

370
00:29:13 --> 00:29:25
Well, it gets a little complicated.

371
00:29:25 --> 00:29:31
Certainly nucleic acids have like
phosphate in them, but so does RNA.

372
00:29:31 --> 00:29:36
That's going to be hard.
Maybe if I had a mixture of things

373
00:29:36 --> 00:29:41
and I wanted to prove whether
something was let's say DNA,

374
00:29:41 --> 00:29:46
a protein or something, you need
some really specific way of saying I

375
00:29:46 --> 00:29:51
did something to the DNA and not to
the protein or something like that.

376
00:29:51 --> 00:29:56
Have you heard anything in this
course that is really specific?

377
00:29:56 --> 00:30:02
Enzymes.  Do you think that'd give
you an idea of how you might do it?

378
00:30:02 --> 00:30:06
If I've got a tube and it's mostly
DNA and maybe a bit of protein and

379
00:30:06 --> 00:30:10
something, and let's say his idea is
working, that we can take the DNA

380
00:30:10 --> 00:30:14
from this cell and put it over into
the second cell and see the

381
00:30:14 --> 00:30:19
characteristic change,
if I wanted to do something to show

382
00:30:19 --> 00:30:23
that it was the DNA in the tube that
was responsible,

383
00:30:23 --> 00:30:27
could you use an enzyme?
And what kind of enzyme would you

384
00:30:27 --> 00:30:32
want?  Well, what characteristics
would you like it to have?

385
00:30:32 --> 00:30:38
Nature's probably made it for you
already.  Something that synthesizes

386
00:30:38 --> 00:30:44
DNA?  Something that breaks down DNA?
Say I treated this tube with some

387
00:30:44 --> 00:30:50
kind of enzyme and then I wanted to
see the outcome,

388
00:30:50 --> 00:30:56
what would we want,
an enzyme that did what?

389
00:30:56 --> 00:31:00
Anybody else got an idea?
You're asserting that it's the DNA

390
00:31:00 --> 00:31:04
in my prep, I like your idea,
but I need to prove it so I need to

391
00:31:04 --> 00:31:07
do something to show that it's
actually the DNA and not the other

392
00:31:07 --> 00:31:11
stuff.  So if I had an enzyme that
did what to DNA?

393
00:31:11 --> 00:31:14
If I broke it down,
yeah.  We could treat it.

394
00:31:14 --> 00:31:18
And if your idea is right,
we treat the stuff with something

395
00:31:18 --> 00:31:21
that specifically breaks down DNA it
won't get transferred.

396
00:31:21 --> 00:31:25
Does that make sense?  OK.
I mean that's a way you could go at

397
00:31:25 --> 00:31:28
a proof of this.
And, in fact, that's what happened.

398
00:31:28 --> 00:31:32
But I'm going to quickly tell you
how it actually happened.

399
00:31:32 --> 00:31:36
And again, you know,
as I say, I'm trying to tell you a

400
00:31:36 --> 00:31:40
few things that are besides here are
the facts that you need to know on

401
00:31:40 --> 00:31:44
exam.  There's a bigger picture here
and this is how research goes,

402
00:31:44 --> 00:31:48
and particularly in an experimental
science such as biology.

403
00:31:48 --> 00:31:52
The important early work on this
came from a guy who was known as

404
00:31:52 --> 00:31:56
Frederick Griffith.
He was in London.  He was a

405
00:31:56 --> 00:32:00
physician.  He was working
in the 1920s.

406
00:32:00 --> 00:32:11
And he was studying pneumonia.
That's an infection of the lungs --

407
00:32:11 --> 00:32:20
-- by bacteria.

408
00:32:20 --> 00:32:25
There's more than one kind of
bacterium that will cause pneumonia,

409
00:32:25 --> 00:32:30
but one of the really important ones
clinically was streptococcus --

410
00:32:30 --> 00:32:38
-- pneumonia.  So it was a bacterium.

411
00:32:38 --> 00:32:43
It was given that name.
We all have bacterium on us.

412
00:32:43 --> 00:32:49
I think I told you we have about
ten to the twelfth on our skin,

413
00:32:49 --> 00:32:54
for example.  And if streptococcus
is on your skin it's not a problem,

414
00:32:54 --> 00:32:59
but if it gets into your lungs it's
a problem.  And so to live with all

415
00:32:59 --> 00:33:05
these bacteria with us our
bodies have defenses.

416
00:33:05 --> 00:33:08
So we have this immune system,
we'll talk about more, and a bunch

417
00:33:08 --> 00:33:11
of defender cells.
Things that you know as white blood

418
00:33:11 --> 00:33:14
cells are defenders.
Let's just see here.

419
00:33:14 --> 00:33:18
I'm going to show you this little
movie.  This is one of your white

420
00:33:18 --> 00:33:21
blood cells, a special kind of white
blood cell.  That little thing it's

421
00:33:21 --> 00:33:24
chasing is a bacterium.
These round things are red blood

422
00:33:24 --> 00:33:28
cells.  I mean doesn't it look like
a dog going after a mouse,

423
00:33:28 --> 00:33:32
or a cat going after something?
It's chasing it.

424
00:33:32 --> 00:33:36
It can tell it's there.
This is remarkable.  And it's a

425
00:33:36 --> 00:33:41
little pixilated,
but this is real.  It's going to

426
00:33:41 --> 00:33:45
catch it right about there.
And it eats it.  I mean we have

427
00:33:45 --> 00:33:49
these cells inside us.
That's why you don't die even

428
00:33:49 --> 00:33:54
though we live in a world that's
surrounded by bacteria.

429
00:33:54 --> 00:33:58
OK, so we'll go on.  So getting
pneumonia in those days was

430
00:33:58 --> 00:34:03
a really bad thing.
You get infected,

431
00:34:03 --> 00:34:07
you get this in your lungs,
and then you have four to six days

432
00:34:07 --> 00:34:12
of high fever,
and then the patient would reach

433
00:34:12 --> 00:34:17
what's termed as a “crisis”.
And one of two things would happen.

434
00:34:17 --> 00:34:21
They'd either live or they'd die.
And that was it.

435
00:34:21 --> 00:34:26
I mean this was no fun if somebody
you knew had it because you didn't

436
00:34:26 --> 00:34:27
know the outcome.
And the outcome wasn't necessarily

437
00:34:27 --> 00:34:23
very good.  Now you call up the
doctor and they pump you full of

438
00:34:23 --> 00:34:19
antibiotics, but antibiotics hadn't
been discovered yet.

439
00:34:19 --> 00:34:15
So this was pretty serious business,
and people were trying to understand

440
00:34:15 --> 00:34:11
what was happening.
But what was going on during these

441
00:34:11 --> 00:34:07
four to six days that then led to
one of these two outcomes?

442
00:34:07 --> 00:34:03
Well, it turns out that
streptococcus is a bacteria like

443
00:34:03 --> 00:35:07
this.  So that's the bacterium.

444
00:35:07 --> 00:35:11
And it has around it something known
as a capsule.  And what that capsule

445
00:35:11 --> 00:35:15
is polysaccharide.
Remember back to the second lecture

446
00:35:15 --> 00:35:19
when I was confusing you all by
showing you how sugars could hook

447
00:35:19 --> 00:35:23
together in all a manner of
different ways?

448
00:35:23 --> 00:35:27
Well, that's what polysaccharides
are.  You just hook a bunch

449
00:35:27 --> 00:35:31
of sugars together.
And for this course you don't have

450
00:35:31 --> 00:35:34
to remember the linkages in
particular.  You just have to

451
00:35:34 --> 00:35:37
understand that there are different
kinds of linkages,

452
00:35:37 --> 00:35:40
and every time you hook at it in a
different way you get a different

453
00:35:40 --> 00:35:43
kind of polysaccharide out of it.
But anyway, the bacterium make this

454
00:35:43 --> 00:35:46
capsule of polysaccharide.
And it's full of hydroxyl groups

455
00:35:46 --> 00:35:49
from all those sugars so it attracts
a lot of water around it.

456
00:35:49 --> 00:35:52
And what it does is it causes a
problem for those defender cells

457
00:35:52 --> 00:35:55
that we just saw.
Those would be, for example,

458
00:35:55 --> 00:35:59
a macrophagic kind of white blood
cell.

459
00:35:59 --> 00:36:02
And it cannot eat something that's
got the capsule.

460
00:36:02 --> 00:36:06
Now, here's a picture of one of
these capsules on one of these kinds

461
00:36:06 --> 00:36:10
of bacteria.  You can sort of see it
out here.  It's polysaccharide.

462
00:36:10 --> 00:36:14
That's the main part of the
bacterium.  And here's another

463
00:36:14 --> 00:36:18
pixilated thing of one of these
white blood cells eating a bacterium

464
00:36:18 --> 00:36:22
that doesn't have a capsule.
But watch what happens if the

465
00:36:22 --> 00:36:26
bacterium has a capsule.
It cannot get a hold of it.

466
00:36:26 --> 00:36:30
It just cannot quite grab hold of
it.  So what happened during those

467
00:36:30 --> 00:36:34
days, though, was this capsule which
is a foreign entity to your body

468
00:36:34 --> 00:36:38
gets recognized in your
immune system.

469
00:36:38 --> 00:36:42
And your immune system made
antibodies that could recognize that.

470
00:36:42 --> 00:36:47
We'll talk about what these are,
but all you need to know for the

471
00:36:47 --> 00:36:52
moment is that they're proteins and
they can be tuned to recognize some

472
00:36:52 --> 00:36:57
chemical entity with a very,
very high degree of specificity.

473
00:36:57 --> 00:37:02
So what the body was doing during
this thing was trying to make

474
00:37:02 --> 00:37:07
antibodies that would help it
recognize this capsule.

475
00:37:07 --> 00:37:10
And then it decorates the capsule
with these things.

476
00:37:10 --> 00:37:14
And once it puts antibodies stuck
all over the surface now it can get

477
00:37:14 --> 00:37:18
a hold of it.  And,
again, a fact you don't have to know.

478
00:37:18 --> 00:37:22
This whole process is called
opsonization.  The reason they use

479
00:37:22 --> 00:37:26
the word opsin because opsin is the
Greek word for seasoning.

480
00:37:26 --> 00:37:30
And it was as if these white blood
cells liked to have their bacteria

481
00:37:30 --> 00:37:34
seasoned correctly before
they can eat them.

482
00:37:34 --> 00:37:37
And what's really going on is that
they're decorating them with

483
00:37:37 --> 00:37:40
antibodies.  So what was going on
after a person got sick,

484
00:37:40 --> 00:37:43
it was a race between their immune
system trying to make antibodies

485
00:37:43 --> 00:37:47
which would let their immune system
suppress the infection and the

486
00:37:47 --> 00:37:50
bacterium which is replicating
unchecked for the first few days.

487
00:37:50 --> 00:37:53
And that's why it was such a scary
business, because you didn't know

488
00:37:53 --> 00:37:57
what the outcome was and things
could tip it one way

489
00:37:57 --> 00:38:03
or the other.
Well, this did suggest a kind of

490
00:38:03 --> 00:38:13
therapy.  The kind of therapy would
be to isolate a capsule

491
00:38:13 --> 00:38:25
to inject a horse.

492
00:38:25 --> 00:38:28
Get the antibodies from the horse.
Why a horse?  A horse is huge,

493
00:38:28 --> 00:38:32
right?  It makes a lot
of antibodies.

494
00:38:32 --> 00:38:39
A lot better than injecting a mouse
if you want to get antibodies.

495
00:38:39 --> 00:38:46
So get antibodies and then inject
the patient.  It's a good idea in

496
00:38:46 --> 00:38:53
principle.  So you're sort of
short-circuiting this whole process.

497
00:38:53 --> 00:39:00
The problem was there were more
than 20 kinds of capsules.

498
00:39:00 --> 00:39:07
And so what people had to do was
they had to isolate

499
00:39:07 --> 00:39:17
the bacterium --

500
00:39:17 --> 00:39:30
-- from the patient,
determine the type of capsule.

501
00:39:30 --> 00:39:35
Let's say it's sort of from capsule
1 up to capsule type 20,

502
00:39:35 --> 00:39:40
which one it was, and then inject
the correct antibody.

503
00:39:40 --> 00:39:46
So this was nerve-racking because
it took a while for the bacteria to

504
00:39:46 --> 00:39:51
grow so it was a pretty tight time
window.  And if you saw the patient

505
00:39:51 --> 00:39:57
right away that's good,
but if they were partway down the

506
00:39:57 --> 00:40:02
infection not so good.
So the one other thing to do this,

507
00:40:02 --> 00:40:06
they didn't bother all the way to
isolate the capsule.

508
00:40:06 --> 00:40:10
What they would usually do is use
heat-killed bacteria and then you'd

509
00:40:10 --> 00:40:14
have the capsule and everything.
The bacterium is dead, it cannot do

510
00:40:14 --> 00:40:19
anything, and they'd inject the
horse with that.

511
00:40:19 --> 00:40:23
And that would get you the
antibodies with the capsule.

512
00:40:23 --> 00:40:27
So what Griffith was doing was he
was fiddling around

513
00:40:27 --> 00:40:32
with this system.
And there was one other discovery

514
00:40:32 --> 00:40:36
that he made.  Perhaps it wouldn't
surprise you that since the bacteria

515
00:40:36 --> 00:40:40
surrounded by a molecule absorbs
water that the capsules would look

516
00:40:40 --> 00:40:45
sort of glistening.
They absorbed a lot of water.

517
00:40:45 --> 00:40:49
You can see how they look here.
So what they discovered was if they

518
00:40:49 --> 00:40:54
have a capsule you get what are
called smooth colonies.

519
00:40:54 --> 00:40:58
And the word colony in this thing
just refers to it started out as one

520
00:40:58 --> 00:41:03
bacterium and it kept dividing and
dividing and dividing.

521
00:41:03 --> 00:41:07
And maybe there are ten to the
eighth or ten to the ninth bacteria

522
00:41:07 --> 00:41:11
in that little colony.
But you can see it.  They've all

523
00:41:11 --> 00:41:15
got capsules on the outside so it
attracts a lot of water and it looks

524
00:41:15 --> 00:41:19
wet.  And those are what you saw.
But what they found is if you

525
00:41:19 --> 00:41:23
waited or grew the cultures up that
you would see some things that

526
00:41:23 --> 00:41:27
looked dry or they called them rough.
And these turned out to be bacteria

527
00:41:27 --> 00:41:33
that lacked a capsule.
And so if you might start with a

528
00:41:33 --> 00:41:40
smooth strain S here and then
isolate from it a rough strain it

529
00:41:40 --> 00:41:48
might designate it in that kind of
way.  So this is the sort of thing

530
00:41:48 --> 00:41:55
that Griffith was fooling around
with.  So he started with doing this

531
00:41:55 --> 00:42:02
kind of experiment.
He took a smooth strain making a

532
00:42:02 --> 00:42:08
capsule type two,
OK?  So he was injecting a mouse

533
00:42:08 --> 00:42:14
with this.  And what happened was
the mouse was dead.

534
00:42:14 --> 00:42:20
This was a virulent form of the
bacterium.  So if he took the rough

535
00:42:20 --> 00:42:26
mutant, injected the mouse,
the mouse is alive and you saw why.

536
00:42:26 --> 00:42:32
If it doesn't have a capsule,

537
00:42:32 --> 00:42:36
the mouse has defender cells and
white blood cells could eat it.

538
00:42:36 --> 00:42:41
Then he had heat-killed S3.  So
this was a strain of streptococcus

539
00:42:41 --> 00:42:46
that had a different capsule,
a type 3 capsule, but it was

540
00:42:46 --> 00:42:50
heat-killed.  Why was he working
with heat-killed stuff?

541
00:42:50 --> 00:42:55
Because that's what you injected
the horses with to get it.

542
00:42:55 --> 00:43:00
So what do you think would happen
here?

543
00:43:00 --> 00:43:06
Since the bacteria are dead,
probably not a big surprise the

544
00:43:06 --> 00:43:13
mouse is alive.
Now, I don't know whether he did

545
00:43:13 --> 00:43:19
this on purpose or he did it as a
control, but what he did was he

546
00:43:19 --> 00:43:26
injected at the same time then R2
plus heat-killed S3.

547
00:43:26 --> 00:43:32
So he's got two things that don't
do anything, he injects a mouse,

548
00:43:32 --> 00:43:38
and uh-oh, the mouse dies.
That is a weird result.

549
00:43:38 --> 00:43:42
That is actually also, though,
the first really key step to

550
00:43:42 --> 00:43:47
understanding that DNA is a genetic
material.  It doesn't look like it

551
00:43:47 --> 00:43:52
at this point probably,
but it was.  This is how we learned

552
00:43:52 --> 00:43:56
this really enormous fact from these
experiments.  He wasn't trying

553
00:43:56 --> 00:44:00
to figure it out.
He was trying to work out something

554
00:44:00 --> 00:44:04
else, as you can see,
but it was a bizarre finding.

555
00:44:04 --> 00:44:08
So what would you think?  I've put
in something that used to have a R2

556
00:44:08 --> 00:44:12
capsule.  So did it get rejuvenated
somehow by this heat-killed thing or,

557
00:44:12 --> 00:44:16
as you'd suggested,
did some characteristic get

558
00:44:16 --> 00:44:20
transferred from here or whatever?
So he isolated the bacteria out of

559
00:44:20 --> 00:44:24
this, and what he found now was he
had a live bacterium

560
00:44:24 --> 00:44:29
that was making S3.
So something had been transferred

561
00:44:29 --> 00:44:35
from this set of dead bacteria into
bacteria that were alive,

562
00:44:35 --> 00:44:41
and the characteristic had been
passed from the dead bacterium to

563
00:44:41 --> 00:44:47
the new bacterium,
the other bacterium.

564
00:44:47 --> 00:44:53
So this is about what Griffith did,
but this problem was picked up by a

565
00:44:53 --> 00:44:59
scientist at Rockefeller,
Oswald Avery who worked as part of a

566
00:44:59 --> 00:45:04
team.
And he took this finding and started

567
00:45:04 --> 00:45:10
to work on it and tried to figure
out, because he saw in this result a

568
00:45:10 --> 00:45:16
way of finding out what was the
genetic material because somehow

569
00:45:16 --> 00:45:21
what was in that heat-killed S3 was
the stuff that would transfer

570
00:45:21 --> 00:45:27
genetic information into another
bacterium.  So he made one

571
00:45:27 --> 00:45:31
really big discovery.
And that was you didn't need the

572
00:45:31 --> 00:45:35
mouse at all.  All that was
happening was the mouse,

573
00:45:35 --> 00:45:38
by dying, was in essence selecting
for smooth bacteria.

574
00:45:38 --> 00:45:42
So he could simplify things by just
taking a rough bacteria,

575
00:45:42 --> 00:45:45
taking the heat-killed extract,
putting it in, and now he'd just

576
00:45:45 --> 00:45:49
look for smooth colonies.
Didn't need any mice at all.

577
00:45:49 --> 00:45:52
So he was able to see the
characteristic of the capsule being

578
00:45:52 --> 00:45:56
transferred from some kind of
heat-killed mess of things into a

579
00:45:56 --> 00:46:00
rough bacterium and changing it into
a live bacterium.

580
00:46:00 --> 00:46:04
So he started fractionating,
and he did exactly the kind of

581
00:46:04 --> 00:46:08
approach that you suggested.
And he purified and he purified and

582
00:46:08 --> 00:46:12
he purified using as his assay this
ability to pass on this smooth

583
00:46:12 --> 00:46:16
characteristic.
And what he ended up with was

584
00:46:16 --> 00:46:20
virtually pure DNA but,
as I said, you know, always never

585
00:46:20 --> 00:46:24
quite pure.  And somebody can always
argue, well, you've got a little bit

586
00:46:24 --> 00:46:28
of something else in there.
So he did a really key experiment

587
00:46:28 --> 00:46:33
and he treated with DNAs,
your experiment.

588
00:46:33 --> 00:46:00
And it lost the transforming
activity.  So this process of doing

589
00:46:00 --> 00:45:50
this was called transformation.

590
00:45:50 --> 00:46:04
Initially it described that
phenomenon.  Now that we know what

591
00:46:04 --> 00:46:18
matters in the thing was taking DNA
and putting it in.

592
00:46:18 --> 00:46:33
So if you do a UROP somewhere here,
you clone a piece of DNA into a

593
00:46:33 --> 00:46:47
plasma and you stick it into E.
coli so you can grow it up,  that

594
00:46:47 --> 00:47:01
process of taking the naked DNA and
putting it inside the bacteria,

595
00:47:01 --> 00:47:11
you'll call it transformation.
Now, in fact, this result wasn't

596
00:47:11 --> 00:47:16
accepted right away.
This was published in 1944.

597
00:47:16 --> 00:47:20
And the general realization that
DNA was the genetic material really

598
00:47:20 --> 00:47:25
didn't come until the ‘50s.
Yet this result proved it, if you

599
00:47:25 --> 00:47:30
will, but part of the problem was
the world wasn't yet ready to accept

600
00:47:30 --> 00:47:34
that DNA was a genetic material.
And maybe you can see the problem.

601
00:47:34 --> 00:47:37
It looked like a monotonous
molecule.  It only had four things

602
00:47:37 --> 00:47:40
that were different in it.
And if you isolated they were all

603
00:47:40 --> 00:47:43
often kind of there and about the
same amount.  People thought it was

604
00:47:43 --> 00:47:46
just an analyst GATC.
It didn't sound like anything had

605
00:47:46 --> 00:47:49
encoded information.
Proteins looked really attractive.

606
00:47:49 --> 00:47:52
Twenty different amino acids that
all had different characteristics,

607
00:47:52 --> 00:47:55
so that was a great place for
storing information.

608
00:47:55 --> 00:47:58
So the world wasn't quite ready to
accept it, even though the

609
00:47:58 --> 00:48:02
experimental evidence was there.
And so the result came later.

610
00:48:02 --> 00:48:07
Now, the last thing I just want to
show you, because there's a kind of

611
00:48:07 --> 00:48:12
direct link from that Avery
experiment to you guys because a

612
00:48:12 --> 00:48:17
year or two ago it was the 50th
anniversary of the discovery of DNA.

613
00:48:17 --> 00:48:22
And Avery worked with a team of two
other people called MacLeod and

614
00:48:22 --> 00:48:27
McCarty.  This was at the 50th
anniversary, the meeting down at

615
00:48:27 --> 00:48:32
Cold Spring Harbor celebrating it.
McCarty was the only member of the

616
00:48:32 --> 00:48:36
team alive.  There he was.
I asked him to autograph my program.

617
00:48:36 --> 00:48:41
There was his signature.
He just died a little while ago,

618
00:48:41 --> 00:48:45
and so there's no living connection
to that anymore,

619
00:48:45 --> 00:48:50
but I have a picture to show you
guys that takes you back from that

620
00:48:50 --> 00:48:54
experiment to his signature right
there.  OK?  So I'll tell you some

621
00:48:54 --> 00:48:57
more stuff next lecture.
Have a good weekend.
