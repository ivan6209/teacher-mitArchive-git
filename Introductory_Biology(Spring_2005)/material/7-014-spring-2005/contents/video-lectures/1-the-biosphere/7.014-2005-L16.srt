1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
So my name is Penny Chisholm and I
am a professor in the Department of

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:10
Civil and Environmental Engineering
with a joint appointment in biology

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:16
and I'm a microbial ecologist.
I'm an ecologist by training and I

4
00:00:16 --> 00:00:21
work on microbes in the oceans,
photosynthetic plants in the oceans.

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:27
They're called phytoplankton.
That's the research

6
00:00:27 --> 00:00:32
that my lab does.
Whenever I'm using examples in here,

7
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
a lot of times I'll be using
examples of microbes and of plants

8
00:00:36 --> 00:00:41
in the oceans.
I know most people know a lot more

9
00:00:41 --> 00:00:46
about trees than they know about
things that photosynthesize in the

10
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
oceans.  And I'll convince you that
you should be as bonded to

11
00:00:50 --> 00:00:55
phytoplankton as you are to trees in
terms of recognizing your dependency

12
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00
on them.  So that's just a little
bit about my background.

13
00:01:00 --> 00:01:06
Now, let me find out a little bit
about you.  Is there anyone in here

14
00:01:06 --> 00:01:12
who has taken the ecology class 7.
3 or 1.018 that I used to teach but

15
00:01:12 --> 00:01:18
haven't taught for the last two
years?  No.  Well,

16
00:01:18 --> 00:01:24
that's good because there's some
redundancy.  And are there any

17
00:01:24 --> 00:01:30
Terrascope students or alums in here?
OK.  Just curious.

18
00:01:30 --> 00:01:34
So let me tell you just briefly
about my hopes for our interactions

19
00:01:34 --> 00:01:39
in this class,
and I stress the term interaction.

20
00:01:39 --> 00:01:44
I don't want to stand up here
talking at you.

21
00:01:44 --> 00:01:49
I really hope that you will ask
questions and interact with me.

22
00:01:49 --> 00:01:53
It makes it much more interesting
for us up here if people are asking

23
00:01:53 --> 00:01:58
questions and challenging.
I expect you to challenge what I

24
00:01:58 --> 00:02:03
say.
The field of ecology is very broad.

25
00:02:03 --> 00:02:08
It uses knowledge from physics,
from chemistry,

26
00:02:08 --> 00:02:13
from geology, all these diverse
fields, and biology of course.

27
00:02:13 --> 00:02:18
And so some of the things I'm going
to talk about,

28
00:02:18 --> 00:02:23
I know there are students here who
know more about it than I do because

29
00:02:23 --> 00:02:29
I think you all are majoring in very
diverse majors at MIT.

30
00:02:29 --> 00:02:34
So I expect that if I'm saying
something wrong that you challenge

31
00:02:34 --> 00:02:39
me because we're all in this
together.  The goal is to learn,

32
00:02:39 --> 00:02:45
not necessarily to be right all the
time.  OK.  So what I'm going to do

33
00:02:45 --> 00:02:50
today is really to give you a broad
overview of the field of ecology.

34
00:02:50 --> 00:02:55
And the things that I'll talk about
are things that we're going to go

35
00:02:55 --> 00:03:01
into in depth in the next series of
whatever lectures I have,

36
00:03:01 --> 00:03:06
ten or eleven.
So most of this you don't need to

37
00:03:06 --> 00:03:12
take any detailed notes on or
whatever.  This is just to forecast

38
00:03:12 --> 00:03:18
what's to come.
At the end I'll tell you what the

39
00:03:18 --> 00:03:23
important points are.
So what is ecology?  It's a very

40
00:03:23 --> 00:03:29
broad field and it's basically the
study of the interaction between

41
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
organisms and their environment.
Or the study of what regulated the

42
00:03:31 --> 00:03:31
distribution and abundance of
organisms.  And what we're going to

43
00:03:31 --> 00:03:30
do is talk about the subdivisions of
ecology and look at the

44
00:03:30 --> 00:03:30
characteristics of ecological
systems, define some general

45
00:03:30 --> 00:03:29
characteristics and then we'll begin
to talk about ways that life

46
00:03:29 --> 00:03:29
mediates the transformation of
energy and mass on earth.

47
00:03:29 --> 00:03:39
So in this class I'm going to be
talking about all levels of

48
00:03:39 --> 00:03:49
organization of living systems from
the biochemical level,

49
00:03:49 --> 00:03:59
the gene level to the entire
biosphere, no small challenge.

50
00:03:59 --> 00:04:10
So the discipline of ecology, I'm
going to move this down a little bit,

51
00:04:10 --> 00:04:20
is only about a hundred years old.
It's a relatively new discipline

52
00:04:20 --> 00:04:31
but it's a strict natural science.
Ecology is not environmentalism.

53
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
Ecology is not recycling.
Ecology is a branch of the

54
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
biological sciences.
And it uses the Scientific Method

55
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
which I know you're
all familiar with.

56
00:04:43 --> 00:04:51
But let's just review how ecologists

57
00:04:51 --> 00:05:01
learn about how systems work.
And it starts with observation.

58
00:05:01 --> 00:05:07
Sometimes called descriptive.
You go out and you describe what

59
00:05:07 --> 00:05:13
you see in nature.
So description.  And from that you

60
00:05:13 --> 00:05:19
form a hypothesis about the things
that are structuring that system.

61
00:05:19 --> 00:05:25
And then you actually do
experiments.  And this is something

62
00:05:25 --> 00:05:31
that a lot of people don't realize.
We can do experiments with

63
00:05:31 --> 00:05:35
ecological systems,
be they microsystems,

64
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
or some of the things we'll talk
about in this class are experiments

65
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
with whole ecosystems.
For example, they'll clear-cut an

66
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
entire forest watershed and compare
then the behavior of the elements

67
00:05:47 --> 00:05:51
cycling in that watershed with a
control watershed where you don't

68
00:05:51 --> 00:05:55
clear-cut the trees.
So it's a basic experiment,

69
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
just like you would do in test tubes.
And there are numerous other

70
00:05:59 --> 00:06:03
examples about manipulating whole
ecosystems, fertilizing

71
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
whole lakes.
Obviously, it's more difficult

72
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
because you have to get permission
to do these kinds of things and have

73
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
hundreds of replicates of these
experiments, but it is a way of

74
00:06:15 --> 00:06:20
understanding the systems.
And then from the experimental

75
00:06:20 --> 00:06:24
results you test the hypothesis and
then you develop models of how the

76
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
system works.  And then you revise
your description based

77
00:06:28 --> 00:06:33
on the models.
And then you keep going through that

78
00:06:33 --> 00:06:38
cycle.  Ecology.
At many universities you can get a

79
00:06:38 --> 00:06:44
PhD in ecology.
They have whole departments of

80
00:06:44 --> 00:06:49
ecology.  We at MIT don't.
We have very few people even who

81
00:06:49 --> 00:06:54
are ecologists,
but it is a field and you can go

82
00:06:54 --> 00:07:02
onto get a PhD.  OK.
So what are the subdisciplines of

83
00:07:02 --> 00:07:13
ecology?  And it has to do with the
hierarchical organization of living

84
00:07:13 --> 00:07:24
systems.  Let me go onto my first
slide here.  And I have

85
00:07:24 --> 00:07:32
a pointer.  Oh, well.
I have to stand back.

86
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
So when we think of living systems
you can start with the atom.

87
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
And together they come together and
make up molecules,

88
00:07:40 --> 00:07:45
come together and make up the cell.
And then the cells come together

89
00:07:45 --> 00:07:49
and make up tissues and organs,
and then eventually you have an

90
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
organism.  Although,
you can have unicellular organisms.

91
00:07:53 --> 00:07:58
Here's an organism.
And then a group of organisms

92
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
belonging to the same species is
called a population in ecology.

93
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
And there's a whole field called
population ecology.

94
00:08:06 --> 00:08:11
We'll have a few lectures on that
where you study what regulates the

95
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
growth and the life cycles of a
particular species of organism.

96
00:08:15 --> 00:08:20
And then a collection of
populations is called a community.

97
00:08:20 --> 00:08:24
And there's a whole field called
community ecology.

98
00:08:24 --> 00:08:29
And then a collection of
communities.

99
00:08:29 --> 00:08:34
This is a coral reef.
Can you guys see these slides in

100
00:08:34 --> 00:08:40
the back or is there too much light?
Is it OK?  OK.  Good.  So this

101
00:08:40 --> 00:08:45
would be a coral reef ecosystem.
And then all of the ecosystems

102
00:08:45 --> 00:08:51
collectively on earth constitute the
biosphere.  So ecologists study

103
00:08:51 --> 00:08:57
these systems at different levels of
organization depending on what

104
00:08:57 --> 00:09:02
questions they're interested in.
But of course this is a gross

105
00:09:02 --> 00:09:07
oversimplification of what we know
about living systems.

106
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
For example, an organism.
I mean is an organism really an

107
00:09:11 --> 00:09:16
organism?  Think of yourself,
for example.  Are you only one

108
00:09:16 --> 00:09:24
species?

109
00:09:24 --> 00:09:28
You're a human,
yes.  But there are parts of you

110
00:09:28 --> 00:09:32
that aren't human, right?
What's in your gut?

111
00:09:32 --> 00:09:37
E. coli.  There are more bacteria
in your gut than there are human

112
00:09:37 --> 00:09:42
cells in your body.
And without those bacteria you'd be

113
00:09:42 --> 00:09:47
in [trouble?].
Also your skin is an ecosystem.

114
00:09:47 --> 00:09:52
It's teaming with mites and little
creatures that if you looked under

115
00:09:52 --> 00:09:57
the microscope you'd be appalled.
All of your pours have tiny little

116
00:09:57 --> 00:10:03
ecosystems in them.
And most of these are doing their

117
00:10:03 --> 00:10:09
job.  You're their habitat.
And they're helping you be a living

118
00:10:09 --> 00:10:15
being.  So you yourself are an
ecosystem.  So it's really difficult

119
00:10:15 --> 00:10:21
to talk about these in a very clean
way.  I mean you cannot really study

120
00:10:21 --> 00:10:27
an organism all by itself because
each organism is in itself an

121
00:10:27 --> 00:10:32
ecosystem or a community.
Maybe not an ecosystem but a

122
00:10:32 --> 00:10:38
community of organisms.
But this is the way we have come to

123
00:10:38 --> 00:10:44
divide up the living world at
different levels of organization.

124
00:10:44 --> 00:10:50
And we will talk about all of these
in this class.

125
00:10:50 --> 00:10:56
So ecology really has two broad
branches.  And that's how my series

126
00:10:56 --> 00:11:02
of lectures are divided up.
One is called biogeochemistry.

127
00:11:02 --> 00:11:13
And in this branch is the study of

128
00:11:13 --> 00:11:25
how organisms mediate the
transformation of energy and matter

129
00:11:25 --> 00:11:33
in the biosphere.
And this is essentially talking

130
00:11:33 --> 00:11:38
about the metabolism of ecosystems.
In some ways we will talk about,

131
00:11:38 --> 00:11:43
you've been learning all about the
biochemistry of cells and how cells

132
00:11:43 --> 00:11:48
work and how they process energy,
etc.  The sum of all of that

133
00:11:48 --> 00:11:53
biochemistry in cells results in
these biogeochemical cycles,

134
00:11:53 --> 00:11:59
the interactions between these
organisms and their environment.

135
00:11:59 --> 00:12:07
When we talk about the metabolism of

136
00:12:07 --> 00:12:12
the biosphere you almost can think
of yourself as being inside of a

137
00:12:12 --> 00:12:17
cell looking at the biochemistry of
the whole cell from the inside.

138
00:12:17 --> 00:12:22
It's all a matter of scaling.  And
we'll see that.

139
00:12:22 --> 00:12:27
You've learned about photosynthesis
and respiration, right?

140
00:12:27 --> 00:12:33
Have they?
Yes.  Well, you'll see that those

141
00:12:33 --> 00:12:39
processes that you've learned about
that are subcellular collectively

142
00:12:39 --> 00:12:45
also have a metabolism for the
biosphere.  OK.

143
00:12:45 --> 00:12:51
The second, and this will be my
second set of lectures,

144
00:12:51 --> 00:13:00
is population and community ecology.

145
00:13:00 --> 00:13:08
And here we talk about organisms.
Not just the biochemistry, their

146
00:13:08 --> 00:13:17
collective biochemistry,
but this is the study of the

147
00:13:17 --> 00:13:25
processes that regulate the
distribution and abundance

148
00:13:25 --> 00:13:33
of organisms.
What determines the rates of

149
00:13:33 --> 00:13:40
population growth of a particular
population?  What determines the

150
00:13:40 --> 00:13:47
distribution of different species
over the landscape in a particular

151
00:13:47 --> 00:13:54
habitat?  This part of ecology we
often talk about as being the

152
00:13:54 --> 00:14:02
function of ecosystems, and
this the structure.

153
00:14:02 --> 00:14:06
And the really important thing to
remember is that these two are very

154
00:14:06 --> 00:14:11
much obviously dependent on one
another.  If you change the

155
00:14:11 --> 00:14:15
structure of an ecosystem,
if you cut down all the trees you

156
00:14:15 --> 00:14:20
will change the function of the
ecosystem, there will be no

157
00:14:20 --> 00:14:24
photosynthesis.
OK?  So this is a really important

158
00:14:24 --> 00:14:29
point that these two are related.
And we'll talk about that a lot in

159
00:14:29 --> 00:14:34
more detail when we
go forward here.

160
00:14:34 --> 00:14:40
If we can turn the lights off I'll
show you one of my favorite,

161
00:14:40 --> 00:14:47
favorite, favorite slides, if it
works.  Ah, yes.

162
00:14:47 --> 00:14:53
This is to give you a feeling for
the earth as a living organism,

163
00:14:53 --> 00:15:00
in a sense.  This is the biosphere.
This is obviously a NASA image

164
00:15:00 --> 00:15:07
showing the green is the plants on
earth and this is the dessert.

165
00:15:07 --> 00:15:11
The green in the ocean is the
phytoplankton.

166
00:15:11 --> 00:15:16
And so where there's lots of green
there's more phytoplankton.

167
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
Where there's red there's even more.
And now we're zooming into the

168
00:15:20 --> 00:15:25
Equatorial Pacific.
Here's a big bloom of phytoplankton.

169
00:15:25 --> 00:15:30
And this is about three seasons in
the life of the earth.  OK?

170
00:15:30 --> 00:15:34
But it shows you how dynamic the
surface film of the earth is that we

171
00:15:34 --> 00:15:39
consider the biosphere.
And all of this life and all of its

172
00:15:39 --> 00:15:43
cycling and dynamics influences the
composition of our atmosphere and of

173
00:15:43 --> 00:15:48
our oceans, all of the nonliving
components of the earth.

174
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
And really at the biosphere level
what ecology is,

175
00:15:52 --> 00:15:57
is understanding the interaction
between the living processes and the

176
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
nonliving processes in the earth and
how they coevolved to shape

177
00:16:01 --> 00:16:06
this living planet.
If you were somebody out on mars and

178
00:16:06 --> 00:16:10
you saw that, if you could see that
from mars, but you probably could if

179
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
you were living on mars because
you'd be a different species and you

180
00:16:14 --> 00:16:18
could do all kinds of things,
but you would really get a feeling

181
00:16:18 --> 00:16:22
for this planet is alive,
just seeing those dynamics.

182
00:16:22 --> 00:16:26
And it is.  And we don't know if
we're the only ones but it's

183
00:16:26 --> 00:16:31
certainly worth understanding how
the whole thing works.

184
00:16:31 --> 00:16:38
So that's the goal which is rather
intimidating but very exciting.

185
00:16:38 --> 00:16:46
OK.  And very important concept in
ecology is a concept of

186
00:16:46 --> 00:17:03
emergent properties.

187
00:17:03 --> 00:17:08
And the idea is that at each level
of organization that we talked about

188
00:17:08 --> 00:17:13
here, well, if I cannot go back,
I cannot go back.  Oh, there we go.

189
00:17:13 --> 00:17:18
At each level of organization of
the system that we talk about there

190
00:17:18 --> 00:17:23
has properties that only exist at
that level or organization.

191
00:17:23 --> 00:17:28
So if you want to understand
population ecology or community

192
00:17:28 --> 00:17:33
ecology you cannot study cellular
ecology and just scale up.

193
00:17:33 --> 00:17:37
Now, this runs up against a lot of
MIT reductionist philosophy,

194
00:17:37 --> 00:17:42
right?  I mean what we're all about
here is taking things apart down to

195
00:17:42 --> 00:17:47
their component parts and
understanding them and then building

196
00:17:47 --> 00:17:52
our knowledge from there.
But this whole field of complexity

197
00:17:52 --> 00:17:57
theory that has emerged with a force,
say in the last ten years,

198
00:17:57 --> 00:18:02
is showing us that that's too
oversimplified and that systems,

199
00:18:02 --> 00:18:07
at different levels of organizations,
have their own properties.

200
00:18:07 --> 00:18:11
So if you want to understand how the
earth works you've got to understand

201
00:18:11 --> 00:18:16
the earth.  You cannot just
understand how all the atoms are

202
00:18:16 --> 00:18:20
working.  They're coming together to
make the organisms.

203
00:18:20 --> 00:18:25
And this is fundamentally because
of feedbacks in the system.

204
00:18:25 --> 00:18:30
So let me give you an example.
OK.

205
00:18:30 --> 00:18:36
The brain, and this isn't ecology
but it's an example you can relate

206
00:18:36 --> 00:18:42
to, has ten to the twelfth cells
with ten to the fourteenth

207
00:18:42 --> 00:18:49
connections.  And the emergent
property is your behavior,

208
00:18:49 --> 00:18:55
right?  Those cells are connected in
a certain way which results in the

209
00:18:55 --> 00:19:02
way that you think and feel,
your emotions, your behavior, etc.

210
00:19:02 --> 00:19:08
And in brain research we now have
learned that the way these cells are

211
00:19:08 --> 00:19:14
connected is influenced by the
learning environment for young

212
00:19:14 --> 00:19:20
children.  How the brain is
stimulated influences how these are

213
00:19:20 --> 00:19:26
connected.  So there's a feedback
between the environment experienced

214
00:19:26 --> 00:19:33
by a child and how these
connections are made.

215
00:19:33 --> 00:19:38
Similarly in ecology systems and
throughout evolution there's a

216
00:19:38 --> 00:19:43
feedback.  You have a bunch of cells
doing a certain kind of metabolism

217
00:19:43 --> 00:19:48
which changes the atmosphere of the
planet.  And then that atmosphere

218
00:19:48 --> 00:19:54
selects for certain types of cells
that weren't there before.

219
00:19:54 --> 00:19:59
So there's a constant feedback
between the emergent property

220
00:19:59 --> 00:20:05
feeding back on the system level
below and changing it.

221
00:20:05 --> 00:20:10
And that's really the
characteristics of a complex system.

222
00:20:10 --> 00:20:16
And we'll talk about, in a minute,
some major examples of that.

223
00:20:16 --> 00:20:21
One that I always like to think
about and throw out is that if you

224
00:20:21 --> 00:20:27
knew everything,
did any of you had an ant colony

225
00:20:27 --> 00:20:32
when you were a kid?
Ah, you're deprived.

226
00:20:32 --> 00:20:37
Oh, yes.  OK.  You get the sand and
the two pieces of glass and you put

227
00:20:37 --> 00:20:43
some ants in and they make all these
tunnels and everything.

228
00:20:43 --> 00:20:48
So if you knew everything about
ants and ant behavior and sand and

229
00:20:48 --> 00:20:53
the mechanics of sand could you ever
predict the pattern of those tunnels

230
00:20:53 --> 00:20:59
that they're going to build?
Actually, most of the classes I

231
00:20:59 --> 00:21:04
talk to say yeah.
If I knew all that I could predict

232
00:21:04 --> 00:21:08
it.  But think about it.
OK.  Because I don't think you

233
00:21:08 --> 00:21:12
could.  And this whole field of
complexity theory is really

234
00:21:12 --> 00:21:16
exploding now.
In fact, Northwestern University,

235
00:21:16 --> 00:21:21
I just noticed on the Web, has just
formed an entire school of

236
00:21:21 --> 00:21:25
complexity that has people from all
different fields under one roof,

237
00:21:25 --> 00:21:29
social sciences all the way to
physics under one room studying

238
00:21:29 --> 00:21:34
this phenomenon.
And ecology is complexity at its

239
00:21:34 --> 00:21:40
best.  OK.  So one other thing,
before we move on, is that I said

240
00:21:40 --> 00:21:45
ecology is not environmentalism,
but it's a fundamental science.  But

241
00:21:45 --> 00:21:51
the knowledge that is gained from
the study of ecological systems and

242
00:21:51 --> 00:21:56
the principles of ecology,
that knowledge is used in a field

243
00:21:56 --> 00:22:02
that is growing now called
applied ecology.

244
00:22:02 --> 00:22:07
And that's where you use ecological
knowledge to influence human

245
00:22:07 --> 00:22:13
activities on earth.
And, for example, you'd use

246
00:22:13 --> 00:22:18
ecological knowledge to understand
how much of the earth's forests can

247
00:22:18 --> 00:22:24
we cut down before the system won't
sustain us, that you won't have

248
00:22:24 --> 00:22:29
enough photosynthesis to maintain
the oxygen levels in the atmosphere

249
00:22:29 --> 00:22:35
or draw down enough CO2 so that we
don't all boil up.

250
00:22:35 --> 00:22:40
We'll talk about that.
If you want to protect a particular

251
00:22:40 --> 00:22:45
species, how large of an area do you
have to set aside as a reserve?

252
00:22:45 --> 00:22:51
In order to know that you have to
do fundamental studies of the

253
00:22:51 --> 00:22:56
ecology of that species.
Basically, how far can we,

254
00:22:56 --> 00:23:02
as humans, push these systems from
their “natural state” until they

255
00:23:02 --> 00:23:07
won't function for us anymore?
Because we rely on natural systems

256
00:23:07 --> 00:23:12
for food, fiber and clean water and
the composition of our air.

257
00:23:12 --> 00:23:17
But another point here, I just said
how far from the natural state can

258
00:23:17 --> 00:23:21
we push them, another big important
point, as we talk about ecological

259
00:23:21 --> 00:23:26
systems, is there is no original
state of nature.  There

260
00:23:26 --> 00:23:31
is no baseline.
Nature is ever-changing.

261
00:23:31 --> 00:23:37
Nature is evolving.  And we'll talk
about how much the earth has evolved

262
00:23:37 --> 00:23:42
since the formation of the earth.
So it's important to keep in mind

263
00:23:42 --> 00:23:48
that what humans are doing now,
as we try to have conservation

264
00:23:48 --> 00:23:53
programs and worry about global
warming and the extinction of

265
00:23:53 --> 00:23:59
species, is that we're trying to
keep the earth the way we think we

266
00:23:59 --> 00:24:04
want it right now.
I mean the way we think it was

267
00:24:04 --> 00:24:09
before the Industrial Revolution,
before the massive flux of energy

268
00:24:09 --> 00:24:13
into the system has allowed us to
completely change the biosphere.

269
00:24:13 --> 00:24:18
And that's a really important thing
because the earth “has a mind” of

270
00:24:18 --> 00:24:23
its own.  And we know that,
it doesn't have a mind, it has a

271
00:24:23 --> 00:24:27
behavior of its own.
And we know that there were massive

272
00:24:27 --> 00:24:32
climate changes in the past and
there will be massive climate

273
00:24:32 --> 00:24:37
changes in the future.
And asteroid might hit us.

274
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
And who knows all of these things?
It's going to change.  So our

275
00:24:41 --> 00:24:46
challenge is understanding the
degree to which we want to try to

276
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
control that natural change and try
to not impose rapid change in the

277
00:24:50 --> 00:24:55
rates of things that are already
going on.  So it's a very tricky

278
00:24:55 --> 00:24:59
problem, and you guys are the ones
that are going to inherit

279
00:24:59 --> 00:25:05
it big time.
You're going to be in charge of this

280
00:25:05 --> 00:25:13
biosphere and you're going to have
to figure out how to manage it,

281
00:25:13 --> 00:25:20
because, like it or not, we are
influencing it to such a degree that

282
00:25:20 --> 00:25:27
we have to manage it.
OK.  So another important concept

283
00:25:27 --> 00:25:35
is that, and I've already alluded to
this, the organism environment

284
00:25:35 --> 00:25:42
interaction is two-way.

285
00:25:42 --> 00:25:46
I mean we're all used to thinking
about the “survival of the fittest”,

286
00:25:46 --> 00:25:50
right?  That you have this
environment out there and you have

287
00:25:50 --> 00:25:54
organisms, and the organism that's
more fit, has most adapted to that

288
00:25:54 --> 00:25:58
environment will survive and
reproduce and that's how

289
00:25:58 --> 00:26:02
evolution works.
Well, it's more than that.

290
00:26:02 --> 00:26:07
The important thing is that not
only do organisms adapt to the

291
00:26:07 --> 00:26:12
environment but they actually change
the environment.

292
00:26:12 --> 00:26:16
They co-evolve with the environment.
And so life in the non-living

293
00:26:16 --> 00:26:21
components of the earth are
interacting very intimately and life

294
00:26:21 --> 00:26:26
has fundamentally shaped the nature
of the non-living part

295
00:26:26 --> 00:26:33
of our planet.
So an example of this that I draw

296
00:26:33 --> 00:26:41
from your textbook,
just a very simple example,

297
00:26:41 --> 00:26:50
has to do with the influence of
microbes on the succession of plants

298
00:26:50 --> 00:26:59
in a northern ecosystem.
Succession is --

299
00:26:59 --> 00:27:03
If you start with blank soil and you
just let it sit,

300
00:27:03 --> 00:27:07
how will communities of organisms
come in and colonize?

301
00:27:07 --> 00:27:11
You'll start out with very small
plants and then larger plants and

302
00:27:11 --> 00:27:15
then bushes and then trees over time.
So sometimes ecologists study this

303
00:27:15 --> 00:27:19
by clear-cutting an area and then
following it over time.

304
00:27:19 --> 00:27:23
That takes years and years and
years, much longer than the average

305
00:27:23 --> 00:27:27
scientist's lifespan.
So another way to do this is

306
00:27:27 --> 00:27:32
substitute space for time.
And that's what they've done here.

307
00:27:32 --> 00:27:38
This is a glacier that is receding
in this direction.

308
00:27:38 --> 00:27:43
And so where it initially retreated
soil was exposed and succession

309
00:27:43 --> 00:27:49
started.  And then it retreats more.
So this area is growing while this

310
00:27:49 --> 00:27:54
one is just getting exposed.
So eventually, along this gradient,

311
00:27:54 --> 00:28:00
you have the youngest community up
here and the oldest community

312
00:28:00 --> 00:28:06
down here.
And so they were able to look at the

313
00:28:06 --> 00:28:12
effect of that succession of
different species on the composition

314
00:28:12 --> 00:28:18
of the soil.  And there's an
important successional stage here.

315
00:28:18 --> 00:28:25
So here's the nitrogen content in
the soil as a function of simulated

316
00:28:25 --> 00:28:31
time here and showing that it
increases steadily as succession

317
00:28:31 --> 00:28:38
goes on up to a peak and
then levels off.

318
00:28:38 --> 00:29:05
And that increase is largely due to
the invasion of plants that can fix

319
00:29:05 --> 00:29:32
nitrogen.  Alder trees are a
specific species of trees that have

320
00:29:32 --> 00:29:59
in their roots symbiotic
nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

321
00:29:59 --> 00:29:54
Have you talked about this at all,
nitrogen-fixation?  This is what

322
00:29:54 --> 00:29:50
Professor Walker actually works on
his research in his laboratory.

323
00:29:50 --> 00:29:46
He's a world expert on the
mechanism of this.

324
00:29:46 --> 00:29:41
But these nitrogen-fixing microbes
are the only forms of life really

325
00:29:41 --> 00:29:37
that can take nitrogen gas from the
atmosphere, N2,

326
00:29:37 --> 00:29:33
and using this nitrogenase enzyme
convert it to pneumonia which is

327
00:29:33 --> 00:29:29
what they need to make
proteins, etc.

328
00:29:29 --> 00:29:33
So there's this huge reservoir of
nitrogen gas in the atmosphere,

329
00:29:33 --> 00:29:38
and only through these microbes can
we get that into the soil so that

330
00:29:38 --> 00:29:43
other organisms can use it.
So here's a process at the

331
00:29:43 --> 00:29:48
molecular level where the
biochemistry that you're learning in

332
00:29:48 --> 00:29:52
the rest of this class scaled up
actually completely influences the

333
00:29:52 --> 00:29:57
species that inhabit this ecosystem
by increasing the nitrogen

334
00:29:57 --> 00:30:02
in the soil.
And just to show you how important

335
00:30:02 --> 00:30:06
these microbes are globally,
this is the global nitrogen cycle.

336
00:30:06 --> 00:30:11
And don't worry about the details
because we're going to talk about

337
00:30:11 --> 00:30:15
this in future lectures in big
detail.  So this is just to make the

338
00:30:15 --> 00:30:20
simple point that here's this
biological nitrogen fixation on a

339
00:30:20 --> 00:30:24
global scale.  We have to start
talking about big units here,

340
00:30:24 --> 00:30:29
OK?  This is gigatons of nitrogen.
So I've converted it.

341
00:30:29 --> 00:30:34
A gigaton of nitrogen is equal in
weight to a billion Volkswagens.

342
00:30:34 --> 00:30:40
So you have to think on an annual
scale 140 billion Volkswagens worth

343
00:30:40 --> 00:30:46
of nitrogen is dragged out of the
atmosphere and put into living

344
00:30:46 --> 00:30:52
organisms by the biochemical
processes that you're learning about

345
00:30:52 --> 00:30:58
at the subcellular level.
So massive quantities of stuff is

346
00:30:58 --> 00:31:04
flying around here that you cannot
appreciate until you see it.

347
00:31:04 --> 00:31:09
Now, if there was no life on earth,
that nitrogen cycle wouldn't be a

348
00:31:09 --> 00:31:15
cycle.  None of these processes
would work without the microbes.

349
00:31:15 --> 00:31:20
And we're going to talk about them
in much more detail later.

350
00:31:20 --> 00:31:26
OK.  The other really important
cycle on earth is the carbon cycle.

351
00:31:26 --> 00:31:32
And so I've put this up here to
very simply --

352
00:31:32 --> 00:31:36
Now, you've talked about these
reactions in the biochemical sense

353
00:31:36 --> 00:31:41
in great detail.
This is what I call my

354
00:31:41 --> 00:31:45
impressionistic biochemistry,
all right?  The net reaction of

355
00:31:45 --> 00:31:50
photosynthesis is to take CO2 gas
from the atmosphere using water,

356
00:31:50 --> 00:31:54
using solar energy and convert it to
organic carbon.

357
00:31:54 --> 00:31:59
Think of this as glucose.
Multiply that by six and you've got

358
00:31:59 --> 00:32:04
glucose organic carbon and
oxygen is evolved.

359
00:32:04 --> 00:32:08
So this is what we call the “mass
from gas reaction” on a global scale.

360
00:32:08 --> 00:32:13
This is the foundation of all life
on earth.  Without it there would be

361
00:32:13 --> 00:32:17
no life.  Life was created from this
gigatons of CO2 in the atmosphere

362
00:32:17 --> 00:32:22
and the solar energy.
And then the reverse,

363
00:32:22 --> 00:32:26
of course, is all of the animals and
bacteria, all of the things that

364
00:32:26 --> 00:32:31
cannot photosynthesis use this
organic carbon and use oxygen and

365
00:32:31 --> 00:32:35
burn it in respiration,
that you've learned about,

366
00:32:35 --> 00:32:40
to make chemical energy [as heat?
and cycling the gas back.

367
00:32:40 --> 00:32:45
Now, in order for this to run,
I love that part.  That took me

368
00:32:45 --> 00:32:51
about ten minutes to figure out.
This is that all the other elements

369
00:32:51 --> 00:32:57
on earth need to cycle through.
And it's microbes that do this

370
00:32:57 --> 00:33:02
cycling.
And we're going to talk about that

371
00:33:02 --> 00:33:08
in the next lecture.
Because the system would run down

372
00:33:08 --> 00:33:13
if the elements on earth weren't
cycled by microbes through various

373
00:33:13 --> 00:33:19
redox states.  So this is just a
more detailed scaled down version of

374
00:33:19 --> 00:33:24
what you've already learned in class,
photosynthesis,

375
00:33:24 --> 00:33:30
the Z scheme, making glucose from
the Calvin Cycle.

376
00:33:30 --> 00:33:34
And then that glucose goes into the
mitochondrion.

377
00:33:34 --> 00:33:39
And you have respiration and CO2
evolved.  So this is the micro scale

378
00:33:39 --> 00:33:43
version of what I just showed you
and this is the macro scale version

379
00:33:43 --> 00:33:48
of what I just showed you.
This is the global carbon cycle.

380
00:33:48 --> 00:33:53
And you have a hundred gigatons of
carbon coming into the system

381
00:33:53 --> 00:33:58
through photosynthesis and going out
through respiration.

382
00:33:58 --> 00:34:03
So that's the collective
photosynthesis and respiration

383
00:34:03 --> 00:34:09
metabolism of the earth.
What I'm trying to have you get a

384
00:34:09 --> 00:34:14
feeling for here is that this whole
phenomenon of scaling,

385
00:34:14 --> 00:34:20
that these processes occur at
multiple scales from the subcellular

386
00:34:20 --> 00:34:25
to the biosphere level.
And this is the flat earth version

387
00:34:25 --> 00:34:31
of the globe.  In the northern
hemisphere you can see winter.

388
00:34:31 --> 00:34:36
There's winter,
no green.  There's summer,

389
00:34:36 --> 00:34:41
everything green.  Winter, no green.
Summer, everything green.  And now

390
00:34:41 --> 00:34:46
wait until you see this.
This is cool.  Because that pulsing

391
00:34:46 --> 00:34:51
you can actually see.
This is the CO2 concentration in

392
00:34:51 --> 00:34:56
the atmosphere over a period of
three years or so showing that when

393
00:34:56 --> 00:35:01
respiration is greater than
photosynthesis in the northern

394
00:35:01 --> 00:35:06
hemisphere in the winter,
CO2 in the atmosphere goes up.

395
00:35:06 --> 00:35:12
When photosynthesis greater
respiration, CO2 goes down.

396
00:35:12 --> 00:35:18
So you can see the signature of the
earth breathing in the CO2

397
00:35:18 --> 00:35:24
concentration in the atmosphere.
Also you can see that this is

398
00:35:24 --> 00:35:30
increasing.  And does anybody
know why that is?

399
00:35:30 --> 00:35:35
Hello.  Did somebody say something?
Global warming, yeah.  Greenhouse

400
00:35:35 --> 00:35:40
effect, yeah.  But what's causing
that?  There you go,

401
00:35:40 --> 00:35:45
fossil fuel.  Burning fossil fuel is
causing an increasing trend in the

402
00:35:45 --> 00:35:50
CO2 concentration which is causing
the greenhouse effect which is

403
00:35:50 --> 00:35:55
causing global warming.
And we'll talk about that.

404
00:35:55 --> 00:36:00
This is an emergent property of the
system, the CO2 concentration.

405
00:36:00 --> 00:36:05
Now, in the last slide I showed you
these arrows were the same width.

406
00:36:05 --> 00:36:10
But life on earth was not always
that way.  Respiration didn't always

407
00:36:10 --> 00:36:16
balance photosynthesis.
And this gets to my point about

408
00:36:16 --> 00:36:21
there's no original state of nature.
In the early earth photosynthesis

409
00:36:21 --> 00:36:27
way outpaced the consumption of
organic matter.  So what

410
00:36:27 --> 00:36:33
would that result in?
If this arrow is much more rapid

411
00:36:33 --> 00:36:39
than this arrow?
Oxygen in the atmosphere increased,

412
00:36:39 --> 00:36:45
exactly.  Now, if oxygen in the
atmosphere increases,

413
00:36:45 --> 00:36:51
what happens?  What else happens in
order for that to happen?

414
00:36:51 --> 00:36:57
This increased, too, right?
And, in fact, that is the

415
00:36:57 --> 00:37:02
deposition of fossil fuel.
This is billions of years.

416
00:37:02 --> 00:37:06
Now we're going back to the
formation of the earth 4.

417
00:37:06 --> 00:37:11
billion years ago, origin of life.
Then we have the beginning of

418
00:37:11 --> 00:37:15
oxygenic photosynthesis here.
And it's the phytoplankton in the

419
00:37:15 --> 00:37:20
oceans that started this.
And so oxygen started to accumulate

420
00:37:20 --> 00:37:25
in the oceans but not in the
atmosphere at first.

421
00:37:25 --> 00:37:29
So you have all this photosynthesis
in the oceans which were a very

422
00:37:29 --> 00:37:34
reduced environment.
So the minute the oxygen was evolved

423
00:37:34 --> 00:37:38
in photosynthesis it reacted with
iron, all these reduced compounds,

424
00:37:38 --> 00:37:42
particularly iron, and made iron
oxides.  So it never made it to the

425
00:37:42 --> 00:37:46
atmosphere at first.
So you had the deposition of these

426
00:37:46 --> 00:37:50
banded iron formations in the
ancient marine environment.

427
00:37:50 --> 00:37:54
Then eventually all of that got
oxidized and it escaped into the

428
00:37:54 --> 00:37:58
atmosphere and you started to have a
buildup of oxygen in

429
00:37:58 --> 00:38:02
the atmosphere.
And at the same time that was

430
00:38:02 --> 00:38:07
building up there was burial of this
organic carbon because it wasn't be

431
00:38:07 --> 00:38:12
respired by the heterotrophic
organisms.  And that's the fossil

432
00:38:12 --> 00:38:17
fuel that was built up over all of
these billions of years.

433
00:38:17 --> 00:38:22
Well, not billions.  Yeah,
billions of years.  That we have now

434
00:38:22 --> 00:38:27
burned over a period of a hundred
years releasing all that CO2

435
00:38:27 --> 00:38:32
into the atmosphere.
So we're burning ancient

436
00:38:32 --> 00:38:36
photosynthate over a tiny little
period in the earth's history and

437
00:38:36 --> 00:38:41
throwing it into the atmosphere.
And the earth is saying I don't

438
00:38:41 --> 00:38:46
know how to handle this.
So there's a big question of what

439
00:38:46 --> 00:38:50
the earth's system is going to do
with all of that CO2 that we're

440
00:38:50 --> 00:38:55
putting up there.
And this is all going to happen in

441
00:38:55 --> 00:39:01
like the next 50 years.
And, as I always say in this class,

442
00:39:01 --> 00:39:07
I'll be dead but you won't when it
really hits the fan unless we do

443
00:39:07 --> 00:39:13
something.  So here are the banded
iron formations.

444
00:39:13 --> 00:39:20
We can see the legacy of that
history of the earth in today's rock

445
00:39:20 --> 00:39:26
formations, banded iron formations
of marine origin and terrestrial

446
00:39:26 --> 00:39:32
origin here.  And we can see in the
earth's composition of the earth's

447
00:39:32 --> 00:39:39
atmosphere the signature of the
evolution of life.

448
00:39:39 --> 00:39:45
The composition of the earth's
atmosphere is highly improbable.

449
00:39:45 --> 00:39:51
Thermodynamically improbable if you
didn't have the influence of

450
00:39:51 --> 00:39:57
converting this solar energy into
living biomass.

451
00:39:57 --> 00:40:04
And so the CO2 concentration is
much lower than these planets.

452
00:40:04 --> 00:40:09
And the nitrogen concentration
higher and the temperature a nice

453
00:40:09 --> 00:40:15
balmy 16 degrees.
OK.  So this is just to remind you

454
00:40:15 --> 00:40:20
that these processes operate at all
scales.  Biosphere.

455
00:40:20 --> 00:40:26
This is a little ecosphere I'm
going to bring next time showing you

456
00:40:26 --> 00:40:32
a sealed ecosystem in which all of
these properties go on.

457
00:40:32 --> 00:40:36
And finally.  So I've been talking
about levels of organization from

458
00:40:36 --> 00:40:41
the molecular level up to the
biosphere level.

459
00:40:41 --> 00:40:45
And there's an exciting new thing
happening in my field that is so

460
00:40:45 --> 00:40:50
exciting I have to tell you about it.
And I'll probably be telling you

461
00:40:50 --> 00:40:55
about it more and more as I go along
here.  And that is a whole new field

462
00:40:55 --> 00:40:59
is emerging called molecular ecology
where we're viewing the biosphere as

463
00:40:59 --> 00:41:04
a network of genes.
It's not that you either study

464
00:41:04 --> 00:41:09
cellular molecular biology or
biochemistry or you study the

465
00:41:09 --> 00:41:13
biosphere but you try to think of
the biosphere as a network of genes.

466
00:41:13 --> 00:41:18
And in oceanography we're actually
able to start to do this because the

467
00:41:18 --> 00:41:23
oceans are dominated by
microorganisms,

468
00:41:23 --> 00:41:27
although in this picture I don't
have that properly represented,

469
00:41:27 --> 00:41:32
but we're starting to think about a
sea of organisms as being simply a

470
00:41:32 --> 00:41:37
network of genes.
Most of the genetic information in

471
00:41:37 --> 00:41:43
the oceans is in microorganisms.
And I like to think of the oceans

472
00:41:43 --> 00:41:49
as dissolved information essentially.
When you look out and you see that

473
00:41:49 --> 00:41:54
blue water, there is so much DNA in
there and so many genes doing so

474
00:41:54 --> 00:42:00
many different things it's just
phenomenal.  And there are a billion

475
00:42:00 --> 00:42:05
microbes per liter in sea water.
99.9% have never been cultivated.

476
00:42:05 --> 00:42:10
We know nothing about them.  There
is as much information in that liter

477
00:42:10 --> 00:42:14
as in the entire human genome,
and most of it is of unknown

478
00:42:14 --> 00:42:19
function in this biosphere.
And so just within the last year,

479
00:42:19 --> 00:42:24
this is Craig Venter who was one of
the people who sequences the human

480
00:42:24 --> 00:42:28
genome.  And now that that's over
with, he needs a new challenge.

481
00:42:28 --> 00:42:33
So he's taking on the ocean genome
meaning sequencing all of

482
00:42:33 --> 00:42:38
the DNA in the oceans.
And he's taken his yacht,

483
00:42:38 --> 00:42:43
because he's rich now, which is his
research vessel.

484
00:42:43 --> 00:42:47
And they're going around the oceans
collecting samples,

485
00:42:47 --> 00:42:52
filtering them onto filters and
collecting all the microbes.

486
00:42:52 --> 00:42:57
And then you take it and you grind
it up, you extract the DNA

487
00:42:57 --> 00:43:02
and you sequence it.
And you just get a bunch of little

488
00:43:02 --> 00:43:07
pieces that you identify as genes.
You don't know what organisms they

489
00:43:07 --> 00:43:12
belong to, but you've got genes.
And this is his cruise trek which

490
00:43:12 --> 00:43:18
you notice doesn't have many
northern climbs here,

491
00:43:18 --> 00:43:23
although they did do something up in
Halifax.  And it kind of resembles

492
00:43:23 --> 00:43:28
the Challenger Expedition back in
the 1800s which was one of the first

493
00:43:28 --> 00:43:33
major oceanographic expeditions.
So they published a paper in Science

494
00:43:33 --> 00:43:37
last year.  Just off Bermuda they
found 1.2 million new genes that had

495
00:43:37 --> 00:43:42
never been in the database.
They had to create a new database

496
00:43:42 --> 00:43:46
in order to even put these genes in
it and 1800 new species.

497
00:43:46 --> 00:43:51
And he is estimating the genetic
inventory of the planet,

498
00:43:51 --> 00:43:55
most of which are in these microbes,
to be 20 to 30 billion genes.  And

499
00:43:55 --> 00:44:00
then we're going to have to figure
out what they're all doing.

500
00:44:00 --> 00:44:04
OK.  So just the take-home message.
I'm going to try to do this at the

501
00:44:04 --> 00:44:08
end of each lecture so that you know
what I think is important.

502
00:44:08 --> 00:44:13
So we've talked about life at
different scales.

503
00:44:13 --> 00:44:17
Ecology is the study of life at all
these different scales.

504
00:44:17 --> 00:44:22
Emergent properties is a really
important concept to understand.

505
00:44:22 --> 00:44:26
There's nothing more important than
understanding this organism

506
00:44:26 --> 00:44:31
environment is a two-way street.
There's really no such thing as a

507
00:44:31 --> 00:44:36
free living organism either.
They are all dependant on one

508
00:44:36 --> 00:44:41
another.  Even if you have a culture
of say E. coli which you've supplied

509
00:44:41 --> 00:44:46
glucose to so it can grow,
where do you think that glucose came

510
00:44:46 --> 00:44:51
from?  It's the photosynthetic
product of some plant somewhere.

511
00:44:51 --> 00:44:56
So organisms are not really
free-living.  They are all dependent

512
00:44:56 --> 00:45:01
on one another.
Life has shaped the earth's features,

513
00:45:01 --> 00:45:05
its atmosphere.
The biosphere that I've shown you

514
00:45:05 --> 00:45:10
and the geosphere,
which is what we refer to the

515
00:45:10 --> 00:45:14
nonliving part of the earth,
have coevolved over evolutionary

516
00:45:14 --> 00:45:19
time.  And the genetic inventory of
this is completely unknown.

517
00:45:19 --> 00:45:23
And, of course, microbes rule the
planet, don't forget that.

518
00:45:23 --> 00:45:26
See you next time.
