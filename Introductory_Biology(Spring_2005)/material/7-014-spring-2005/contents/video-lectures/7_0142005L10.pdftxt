7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005 
Transcript – Lecture 10 

So in the  last lecture I spent quite a while trying to convey a sense of how the 
structure of DNA was d iscovered. The crysta llographic data that led to it, as I said, 
was collected by Rosalind Franklin. And  I saw there was some confusion about this 
picture that I showed you next. This is not a photograph of a double helix. This is 
what happened when she bounced the x-ray off the crystal of DNA. 

This is the diffraction pattern that she saw. And  then one works backwards from that 
trying to figure out what kind of structure  it was that would have caused that 
diffraction pattern. And you have to be a pretty good x-ray crysta llographer to draw 
any kind of inferences from that. And there were people, including Francis Crick, who 
saw the implications of it right away. But the point was she collected the data and 
then two people that I told you about then whose name you know so well, Jim 
Watson and Francis Crick, were the two ind ividuals that came up w ith the model that 
exp lained  the d iffraction pattern. 

And therefore we learned the structure of DNA as a double-stranded helix. I a lso 
tried to make the case that it wasn't two geniuses who sat down in the room, took a 
look at this and popped up with the model. It was a story of real people with 
misadventures and mistakes and  recovery from mistakes and so on getting it. It was 
also a very small group. And I'm going to take just a very small minute at the 
beginning of the class because I have a colleague, Vernon Ingram who's sitting down 
here in the front, who was a member of this very small group w ith Jim Watson and 
Francis Crick. 

So he was there where a ll this happened. And almost nobody in the world has had a 
chance in your generation to hear directly from somebody who was there when it 
happened. So asked Vernon if he would come and just talk to you  for a little bit just 
what it was like to be there. Well, thanks, Graham. You seem to be at a very exciting 
state in 7.014. This structure of the secret of life no less. 

And it is interesting that immediately when Watson and Crick put together a model 
of the DNA molecule that fit the x-ray data, that was the point, how do you know a 
model is correct? Because there are certain d istances in the model, and those have 
to correlate exactly w ith the distances of the x-ray spots in the diffraction pattern 
that you saw. That is how you know that a model that you've built to certain 
specifications corresponds to what the molecule of itself in the crystal that you're 
examining actually is composed of. 

It was by sheer accident that I happened to be working as a b iochemist in the MRC, 
The Med ical Research Council lab at the Cavendish Laboratory where Watson and 
Crick were working. Sheer accident. It was a very crowded lab, as Graham sa id. And 
that's something that you should  remember. When you're choosing a lab to work in, 
always go to a lab that's overcrowded. Never go to a lab where there's lots of space 
because a rea lly successful lab attracts so many coworkers, visitors that it rapid ly 
gets overcrowded. 

And that was the case in this laboratory. The director was Max Perutz. Co-director 
John Kendrew doing x-ray crystallography of proteins for almost the first time, and 
solving the protein structure. Francis Crick was a graduate student of Max Perutz's 
doing his PhD work. And the first thing I remember about Francis was when I went 
there as a biochemist to work with Max Perutz, when I went there, there was this ta ll 
gangling guy constantly circulating between the top floor of the build ing, his office in 
the midd le and the x-ray machines at the bottom. 

He was constantly going up and down. And in those days the buildings didn't have an 
elevators or lifts as the English ca lled them. So he was in excellent physical shape. 
Very crowded, a very modest lab. And what's usually forgotten is a key member of 
that group, an eng ineer, Tony Broad, key person because he invented what was then 
the world's best and most efficient x-ray machine, a rotating anode x-ray machine. 
And because to the x-ray crystallographers in that group this machine was available, 
because of that they were the preeminent x-ray structure group in the world. 

My job was as a b iochemist, protein b iochemist, putting a heavy atom, mercury, 
very heavy atom into Max Parutz's hemog lobin crystals in specific places. That has a 
predictable effect on the x-ray pattern and that enab les the Fourier diagram to be 
constructed w ith real phase values for the x-ray diffractions, for the physicists 
among you here. Are there any physicists here? Yeah, I thought so. That was a big 
step forward and that was a lso a big step in figuring out the structure of the DNA 
samp les semi-crysta ls that Professor Wa lker just referred  to. 

All dependent on the engineer Tony Broad who is never mentioned in any of these 
histories, but w ithout him  this would not have happened. So  it was an exciting place 
to work in, very exciting. We were a ll young in those days. And living the lives of 
young men and young women with all the complications that arise when you put a 
whole bunch of very energetic young men, very energetic young women together. 

And by that I mean the interpersona l relationships which when you're in a crowded, 
very active situation can sometimes interfere. And always very entertaining, I can 
tell you that. I could g ive you chapter and verse. But it isn't really so very different 
from people your age now, right? I mean I'm not saying it interferes with you, 
sometimes it might. But it was an exciting lab, an exciting time to be there because 
we were not the only group trying to figure out the structure of DNA. 

A huge competitor was L inus Pauling at Ca ltech who had beaten that same group 
once before, quite recently, over the alpha helix, the crucial component of protein 
structure. He got the right answer first, 1.5 angstrom reflection, the a lpha helix. And 
our group, Max Parutz and our group had been wrong. So the group was smarting 
under that kind of defeat, if you like. 

And competition is a wonderful spur, as long as you don't let  it get out of hand. Well, 
needless to say we d idn't, but the competition w ith the Pauling lab was certainly so 
severe that we awaited the next letter. You see, in those days new scientific 
information arrived not by publications,  that too much too long, but by persona l 
letter. And,  in fact,  the NIH has put together all these various letters in the Francis 
Crick collection. 

And when you have time you should look at those. They're quite interesting because 
they tell you in a way a scientific paper does not tell you. What I feel about my 
experiment results. What she feels about her experiment results. What it means to 

me as a person, to her as a person, to him as a person. So we were constantly 
watching the mail and d iscussing the news as it came in, mostly over a beer at the 
pub next door. 

It was very conveniently located. But being a small group crowded together made 
communication w ithin our group very easy indeed. And we had fights. I don't mean 
physical fights. We had scientific fights. And as a biochemist I was able to settle a 
crucial fight among the crystallographers Crick and Watson who were build ing the 
model. Because, quite frankly, they d idn't know much chemistry. 

And were trying to build a model w ith the wrong confirmation of the peptide bond. 
They d idn't realize that the peptide bond has two possible confirmations. And they 
had at one point a terrib le time trying  to fit everything together because they were 
using the wrong confirmation. I'm ta lking about lactam-lactim for those of you who 
are organic chemists and it means something, a confirmation. 

And once they got the first confirmation then the model clicked into place. So we a ll 
helped,  that's what I'm trying to say. We all helped w ith one great a im in mind. It 
was clear. And you know from what Professor Walker sa id, that the DNA structure, in 
its structure held the clue to crucial physiolog ica l behavior of DNA. And Crick and 
Watson sa id this in their first paper, the structure itself because of its 
complimentarity g ives you an immediate clue as to how it rep licates. 

And replication of DNA structure from generation to generation is, of course, the 
crucial thing about DNA. The copying,  the precise copying from generation to 
generation. And that fell out the of x-ray structure. That's why the x-ray structure 
was so very important, because it gave you an immediate understanding of the role 
of DNA in modern biology. So that's what we did. And eventually the peop le in the 
group,  the group got so overcrowded they built a huge lab that was beautiful, like 
any new lab is. 

But the thing I remember most of a ll was the atmosphere in that p lace. So 
remember, when you go and choose a lab, choose one that's overcrowded. It will 
pay off. [APPLAUSE] Thank you so much. That was rea lly wonderful. Thank you. I 
don't know if some of you realized quite how  rare that was, this discovery of the 
structure of DNA. As I said, probably one of the big discoveries of mankind. 

Because, as Vernon said, you could see so many of the secrets of life as soon as you 
saw that structure. Very few people have ever heard from someone who was there 
at the time. Maybe you'll forget a bunch of stuff down the line, but I hope you'll 
remember you heard somebody who was there when Watson and Crick were there 
and maybe his extra piece of advice about choosing a lab. 

To say one thing quickly, some of you I think understood what I've been trying to 
do. I spent quite a b it of time talking about science being done by real people doing 
real experiments. Thanks for your comments. A  few of you have gone out of your 
way to say that this was a tota l waste of time and you didn't understand why I d idn't 
teach you something instead of doing something on the test. 

Well, I'm making up the test. And if you don't think there'll be something on 
scientific process on the second exam you'll be surprised. So I'm spending a lot of 
time on this, and the reason is because you are MIT students. You know, you can go 
many p laces in the country to many high school biology courses and you can 

memorize, someone w ill tell you to memorize everything that's in the book, and 
you'll get tested whether you can memorize it. 

You guys are at MIT because you have the potentia l to be  leaders in whatever you 
do. I've made the transition  from being an undergrad sort of trying to memorize stuff 
in a  textbook to working on a cutting-edge. I've made some reasonably significant 
discoveries in science, as have my other colleagues in the department, some of them 
making greater than I. But nevertheless if you're on the cutting-edge then you're 
dealing with all the stuff I'm trying to tell you about in this thing. 

You're working as a part of a group. There's competition. There are interpersonal 
relationships. You make mistakes. You recover from them. You're making inferences. 
You're testing models. This is a very comp lex, very real, very dynamic, very human 
interaction. I hope you got a little bit of whiff of that from Vernon. And  I wouldn't be, 
I'm quite capab le of reproducing diagrams from  the textbook w ithout trying to give 
you a deeper understand ing, and that's what I'm trying to do here. 

And I hope if it hasn't made sense to you by the end that at least a  few more of you 
will get it. And those of you who I think saw what I was doing I appreciate your 
telling me that in the things. These are anonymous so I don't know, but a coup le of 
you are certainly trying to make it clear that you didn't think it was worth your time 
coming to lecture. I'm trying to tell you why I'm trying to do  it. 

I'm trying to teach you in a deeper way. And this is a  required course. It's important 
for your life. I hope some of you will see that or if you don't see it now you'll see it 
later in your career. OK. Now, we're going to  talk about DNA replication. I'm going to 
start to drive into some of the details that maybe are more the kind of things you're 
expecting. I just want to make one quick point here. 

I've ta lked about cell division and we saw this, how cells come from other cells going 
to make more cells. I showed you this little movie you've seen a few times of a yeast 
cell dividing, but a ll cells divide. Here's a cancer cell dividing. If you get a cancer it's 
a cell that's forgotten how to stop divid ing and is grow ing to make a tumor. There's 
this cancer cell dividing. 

It looks not unlike a yeast on a molecular level, very, very similar. But there's 
another point. I told you how the structure of DNA w ith the complimentary strands 
with G pairing with C and A pa iring with T  immediately gave rise to an insight as to 
how the genetic material could be rep licated. And you guys know that it's held 
together by hydrogen bonds between base pairs which are about one-twentieth the 
strength of the covalent bonds. 

So you're ab le to peel the strands apart without breaking the covalent bonds. And 
then by pairing A with T and G with C and doing that on both strands then you can 
end up with two  identica l cop ies. And so  if you do two identical copies and you do it 
again you get eight. One of the things we've rea lized over the last two or three years 
in looking through the exams is somehow, at least some of the class, didn't connect 
the business about cells coming from other cells and DNA dup licating to give 
daughter DNA. 

And I'm just trying to hammer home the point that these are related. Every time a 
cell divides it has to duplicate its genetic information. That's why I'm going to be 
telling you about DNA rep lication. Here's a picture of that same cancer cell, but 

watch over here. This is the DNA. And you see it's doub led. And see how the DNA, 
which is the chromosomes, has pulled apart so that at the end you now have two 
cells and you've got identical copies of DNA. 

So if you're studying cancer, for example, this sort of thing is relevant to you. OK. So 
the issue of how -- Well, before I do that, I'm sorry. Just a couple of things about 
DNA replication before I dive into this. So we a ll started out as a single cell. I've got 
a lot more obviously because I'm made up of a lot of cells. If I took a ll the DNA in 
my body and I wind up all the molecules in it, do you guys have any idea how long 
that would be? Who thinks it would reach let's say across the room? OK. 

Across campus? Across Cambridge? Around the world? To the moon? Anybody left? 
To the sun? I've got ten to the fourteenth cells. There's about a meter or two in each 
cell. 10 to 20 billion miles of DNA in each of our bodies, human DNA. They would go 
back and  forth to the sun multiple times. So that much DNA had to get replicated in 
order for the fertilized egg we a ll started out as to become you. 

Another thing, the accuracy of rep lication is about ten to the minus tenth. Most 
people, includ ing myself, don't have a very good feel for exponents. So that's one 
mistake in 10 b illion. You know, it could be one mistake in 10 to the ninety-ninth. 
Well, what is one mistake in 10 b illion mean? So let's relate it to something we 
know. If I was typing  let's say an eight letter word, 60 words a minute, 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week, and I was as good as DNA replication, how often would  I make a 
mistake? So you can each think of how long you think that is. 

But if I was good on average, I would make a mistake once every 38 years. So I'm 
about to tell you about a process that's absolutely astonishing in terms of how fast 
and how much you can do and with an accuracy that goes beyond what we're used 
to in our ordinary life. So how does  it do this? It has to be more than just pulling the 
strands apart. 

And there's been some confusion as to why I'm emphasizing 5 prime and 3 prime. 
Well, each of these subunits, each nucleotide, this is a 3 prime hydroxyl and this is 
the 5 prime position. If we were joining together subunits that had a hook and an 
eye it would make a difference because it's not the same on both ends. If we're 
going to start hooking together it's exactly the same thing when we get to a 
biochemica l level, the 5 prime end is not the same as hydroxyl at the 3 prime end 
because the whole thing  is asymmetric. 

So the enzymes that copy DNA are known as DNA polymerases. And it was a very 
difficult challenge to figure out how they operated, but Arthur Kornberg was the first 
person to solve this problem. He was an extraordinarily gifted biochemist. He's still 
at Stanford. And what he found was if we have a 5 prime end this would then be the 
3 prime end, and there's a 3 prime hydroxyl which is this one right here. 

And this was pa ired, say, with a C and A paired with a T. And let's say a G pa ired 
with a C here. And let's say the next temp late base was, let's make it a T. What 
Arthur Kornberg was able to  find was an enzyme activity that catalyzed a template-
dependent replication of DNA. That was critical because he had to find, if you broke 
the cells open, somewhere in that gamish of enzymes and things from  inside a cell. 

There had to be something that was able to copy DNA. So in order to do that he had 
to work out an assay. And he also had to have some kind of guess as to what the cell 

would be using in order to carry out the synthesis. But one thing that was sort of 
obvious was a DNA template because that was being cop ies. But the other part was 
you had to have energy to form a cova lent bond. 

So somehow  there had to be something that was sort of activated with the energy 
built into the molecule so that thermodynamically the whole thing would slide 
downhill when you made a bond. And he knew that the cell had triphosphates, just 
the same type that we ta lked about when we talked about ATP. So this would be a 
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate. And he was able to make a guess, because he had 
to try things until he found something that would work, that this was what's used in 
DNA synthesis. 

So this hydroxyl ultimately attacks this phosphate here. And these two other 
phosphates then come off as a  leaving group. So if we thought of it as a P like this 
with two more Ps here, these two come off and you get a new bond formed to the 
phosphate. And so what Kornberg then was able to  find by using a DNA template 
that had this sort of structure and P, P, P, like this, that he was now ab le to get an A 
added here. 

This hydroxyl here became the new hydroxyl. And so the direction of synthesis, this 
strand is the other way, so the direction of synthesis of a DNA polymerase,  it's 
polymerizing in the 5 prime to 3 prime direction. This was again an amazing 
discovery because it was the first time that anyone had found an enzyme that could 
copy DNA. Arthur Kornberg got a Nobel Prize for it. But at this point actually genetics 
came in because there was a scientist John Ca irns who was at that point down at 
Cold Spring Harbor, as I told you the other day. 

And John, in sp ite of the fact that Arthur had found a DNA polymerase that had all 
the properties that you would expect for copying DNA, d idn't think that was the one 
that actua lly copied the DNA necessary for cellular replication. So he reasoned if he 
was right he'd be ab le to find a mutation that would eliminate the activity of that 
enzyme and the cell would still live. 

And so they did a screen, and it was a lot of work, but they eventua lly found a 
mutant of E. coli that lacked this DNA polymerase that Arthur Kornberg had 
discovered. And the cell was still a live and was still replicating its DNA. So it told 
both John and then Arthur there must be another enzyme  in the cell. And so Arthur 
went back. And now working in a mutant that was missing this first polymerase he 
discovered he found the one that really rep licates the DNA. 

The first one is important, too. It's needed for DNA repair. I'm going to ta lk to you 
about that in next lecture, but it's not absolutely crucial for life. And there's an 
interplay of genetics and biochemistry. And you'll see I'm just sort of foreshadow ing 
what we're going to get to when we ta lk about the genetics of this. And I know a 
coup le of you clearly were frustrated about me showing you pictures of the people 
who d id this, but nevertheless since this was such a historic event a couple of years 
ago at Cold Spring Harbor. 

This you see the helix model down there. There was J im Watson opening the 
symposium. When I got up to  talk I sa id, well, I told my students that I'd let them 
know what it was like when I was there, so I took out a camera and I took a p icture 
of the aud ience. And so there are a bunch of Nobel Laureates and types here who 

were sitting there smiling for you guys in the class. And there was Arthur Kornberg 
giving his talk. 

Now, these DNA polymerases are  incred ible protein machines. The crystal structures 
of DNA polymerases operating their temp late have been solved. And you can solve, 
depending on how many d iffractions you can get, you can get a model that's more 
and more deta iled. And there have been very high resolution models of DNA 
polymerases. This b lue and white stuff is the surface of the protein, and this is sort 
of a template and the various parts. 

Just to g ive you an idea here are these tracings of the shapes of the electron density. 
You can see how the crystallographers have fit the nucleotides right in the crysta l 
into  these electron densities. And here putting it together a bit in the blue is the 
secondary structure of the protein and the temp lates and whatnot. And I don't 
expect you to see very much in that, but the point is I wanted to sort of just set you 
up to show you this little movie. 

Because DNA polymerases are incredible machines. They copy at about a thousand 
nucleotides a second and their accuracy  is really amaz ing. And  I'll tell you all the 
tricks to the accuracy in the next  lecture, but I want to show you this little movie 
because this is sort of a simulation of what must happen every time a nucleotide is 
added. Now, we'll see this over and over aga in so I'll take it in pieces. 

The yellow and the orange are the secondary structures. That's an alpha helix. And 
certainly one thing you can see is happening, as we're looking at this, is the parts of 
the protein are moving during this. So you can see this alpha helix that's sort of 
swinging up and swing ing back down. Now, what's over here is the temp late base. 
That's the base that correspondents to the T that I was just showing you here. 

This is the incoming nucleotide. There is the triphosphate coming down here. And, in 
fact, you just see those two phosphates going. So what's happening here, this is 
going to be the end of the grow ing chain. It's going attack right there, join the 
phosphate and the pyrophosphate will leave. And if you'll take a look, when you see 
this movement of this helix from the beginning state to up to here, you'll see what 
happens. 

It's squeezing the temp late base and the  incoming nucleotide together. What it's 
really doing is testing  for the correct shape. Remember the shape of an A-T base pa ir 
and a G-C base pair is the same. And if those of you who are confused about 
guanine and the keto-enol thing, try to draw hydrogen bonds with the enol form of 
guanine and see how you do. I think you'll beg in to understand a bit. 

So at the heart of life is something that can copy DNA. And there are these 
exquisitely beautiful machines. The rep licative machine in E. coli has 18 proteins and 
the ones in our bodies are even more sophisticated with even more parts. OK. But to 
replicate a DNA molecule there's another problem that comes up. Because DNA 
polymerases copy -- -- and grow cha ins in a 5 prime to 3 prime direction. 

And they need a 3 prime hydroxy terminus. So they won't work if you just gave it a 
sing le strand of DNA. No DNA polymerase can handle that. It has to have something 
like this where there's a temp late strand -- -- and there's what's known as the 
primer strand. So there has to be something that has the 3 prime hydroxyl and there 
has to be something that's going to provide the template that's going to be cop ied. 

So if we pull strands apart like this with 5 prime to 3 prime then they'll be 5 prime to 
3 prime running in the opposite direction. If we have a template like this, this is OK 
because the strand here can be copied 5 prime to 3 prime. This is the new strand 
being synthesized by the DNA polymerase. But what about the other strand? The 
replication fork is moving in this direction, but if the -- So here is the 3 to 5 prime 
direction here. 

So if the DNA polymerase is going to be copying this strand  it's going to be moving 
backwards to the d irection of the rep lication  fork. Now, I guess evolution and nature 
could have selected for two types of DNA polymerases, one that copies 5 prime to 3 
prime and one that copies in the opposite direction. But it didn't. And there are a 
number of theoretica l reasons that we could d iscuss in a more advanced course 
perhaps for why that is true. 

But,  in fact, what it does is it uses the same polymerase. So as these things peel 
apart the polymerase works in the other direction, but there's another problem. If I 
just peel  it apart like this there's no 3 prime hydroxyl. So it took people quite a  few 
years to  figure out the strategy that's used in nature. Nature has a specia l enzyme 
that makes a little p iece of RNA. It's called an RNA primer. 

And what it does is it provides a 3 prime hydroxyl. And once you have the 3 prime 
hydroxyl at the end of the little RNA cha in then the DNA polymerase -- -- can be 
made 5 prime to 3 prime. So as you peel open the rep lication  fork then little p ieces 
of RNA are used to make a new strand of DNA and it goes this way. Now that 
obviously doesn't give you a new intact DNA strand. And part of the clue to this 
working out what was going on at DNA replication was the recognition that newly 
synthesized DNA was made as little pieces. 

And then later it got joined into longer p ieces. And the person who d iscovered this 
was Okazaki. So  these fragments of DNA that are synthesized initia lly are ca lled 
Okazaki fragments, after the person who discovered this. It was rather puzzling 
because when you tried to look at the synthesis of DNA you're looking at a long 
molecule, and you  found some of the new ly synthesized material was in short pieces. 

And as you watched over time it got longer. So the cell, I think you can sort of see 
from  first princip les what has to happen here then. That  in order to come and make -
- This strand is pretty easy to do, but what the cells have to do now is they've got 
these little RNA primers. And then they remove the RNA by an enzyme that's capable 
of degrading the DNA or clipp ing it at the junction. And that then  leaves the cell in 
this sort of situation where there are little tiny gaps in between these p ieces of DNA. 

But at the end of each one of these is a 3 prime hydroxyl. So another polymerase or 
one or another polymerase  in the cell can fill those little pieces of DNA out. And then 
there's one little nick that needs to be sealed. And so what you  finally end up with is 
a 3 prime hydroxyl here, a 5 prime phosphate that's at the other end, and then 
these are joined together. 

This is one nucleotide here and the other here. These are then joined together to 
give the ordinary phosphodiester bond that links -- -- the two nucleotides together 
like that. And the enzyme that does that is an enzyme called DNA ligase. You can 
almost think about it as DNA Scotch tape that w ill take a little nick in DNA, if we've 
got a phosphate and hydroxyl, and it will join them together. So this process of 

replication, which can go at about a  thousand nucleotides a second with this amazing 
degree of accuracy, uses two different DNA polymerases, both of which biochemica lly 
can only go in one direction. 

But you can see they have to be somehow oriented so that one of them is able to 
move in this direction and the other one is ab le to move in that direction. The key 
part in this sort of the course is to try and understand this 5 to 3 prime and to get 
this basic idea that nature had to do something. It was fa irly easy to copy one strand 
because that was sort of the direction of the polymerase movement was the same as 
the replication fork movement, but the other strand had to have been much more a 
problem. 

And so when you get down to a biochemical level, though, it's very conceptua lly easy 
to say, oh, you've got comp limentary strands so we just take it apart, we take the 
photograph and the negative and we make the opposite one and now we've got two 
copies. When you get down to the biochemical deta ils there is this major b iochemica l 
issue of whether the polymerase can go in the 3 prime or the 5 prime direction. 

And nature has chosen to do it a ll or has been selected to do it a ll somehow with a 
polymerase going in one direction. There are many other aspects to DNA rep lication. 
And one of the tricks that I find most fascinating is that these polymerases, once 
they get on DNA they stay on. And that's part of the secret because it takes about a 
millisecond to add a nucleotide, but  if it comes off the DNA it has to get back on. 

Then it takes about a minute. So  the whole trick to being a very, very fast DNA 
polymerase is to somehow hang onto the DNA. So what biochemists did was they 
purified the actual enzymatic activity that could carry out this process, and then they 
started to  look for other protein factors that would help the process to work better. 
And they d iscovered something ca lled a processivity factor which made the 
polymerase stay on the DNA. 

And people wondered  for a  lot of years how that worked and why did this system 
work so well. And finally the crysta l structure of the processivity factor was 
discovered. And if I go back to this sort of d iagram where this is the p iece of DNA 
that's copied, what it turned out was that the processivity factor is basically a 
doughnut that kind of gets clamped around the DNA like that. 

So it's sort of like taking a washer with a p lace where you can pry it apart opening it 
up, putting it around the DNA like this. And then the polymerase, more or less since 
this is topologica lly linked to the DNA, is like a washer sliding on a w ire. This DNA 
polymerase hangs onto that and it doesn't come off. And I think there's a little 
picture of it. 

Here's a little movie. There's the DNA going through and this is one of these clamps. 
It's virtua lly the same structure in a bacterium and inside of us. But, in fact, the 
amino acids are almost all different. But the underlying structure of the protein is 
almost identica l. And there are special machines ca lled clamp loaders that pry open 
this clamps, clamp them around DNA, and that's part of the secret to how these 
polymerases are able to polymerize DNA so  fast. 

There are a lot of other pieces of this machinery. If you go on you'll hear more about 
them. I just want to g ive you one of the most recent insights. I mean this, as you 
might guess, since DNA rep lication is at the heart of life it's been studied very, very 

hard, ever since the discovery of DNA helix. My colleague, Alan Grossman, made 
quite a d iscovery just probab ly three or four years ago. 

He took that green fluorescent protein that we've seen a few times, and he actually 
joined the gene encoding green fluorescent protein to the backend of a p iece of the 
DNA polymerase. So wherever the DNA polymerase went now there was a little 
fluorescent molecule. And he looked to see where it was in the cell. And I,  like many 
other peop le, had for years taught, and this is why, you know, I have respect for the 
fact that I'm just teaching you the current model. 

For much of my career I taught, so DNA polymerase is sort of like a train going down 
the tracks a thousand molecules per second. And we're doing all this stuff w ith the 
lead ing and with the two strands. So let me just put those words up while I'm up 
there. This one is ca lled, this strand that's easy to replicate is called the leading 
strand. And this one where you have to do the primer and whatnot is ca lled the 
lagging strand. 

In any case, what I had taught was that polymerase was like a tra in running on 
tracks. You could ca lculate how fast it would move. What Alan, to his amazement, 
found was when he looked to see where the DNA polymerase was, it wasn't spread 
out all over the cell as  if you thought it was a thing running on tracks. In fact, it was 
in the center of the cell. And then late in cell division it split into  two spots that went 
to the midpoints of what would be the daughter cells. 

And so what he ended up  realiz ing from that was that instead it was more as if the 
polymerase was a factory and it pulled the DNA through it rather than it traveling 
down the tracks of the DNA. And that was a very surprising d iscovery that went 
against all the dogma and all the p ictures in the textbook. And it was a d iscovery at 
MIT. That was published in, I think it was 2001, something like that, a very recent 
discovery. 

Things keep chang ing. That's again why I keep emphasizing  I cannot teach you a 
fact in biology. I can teach you the best understanding we have that exp lains the 
experiments to date. But somebody may make a discovery tomorrow. That means 
we'll have to change our understand ing. OK? So good luck on the exam. I’ll see you 
on Monday, OK?
