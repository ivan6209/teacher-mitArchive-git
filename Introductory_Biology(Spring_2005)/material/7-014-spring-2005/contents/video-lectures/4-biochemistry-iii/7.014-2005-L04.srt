1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
So the big issue that I was trying
to take on yesterday,

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:09
and this is of really fundamental
importance to biology,

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:14
is that you saw from that molecular
composition of cells 80% water.

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:19
Of the rest of it about 50% of
what's there by mass is protein.

5
00:00:19 --> 00:00:24
Proteins do most of the really
interesting stuff in the cell.

6
00:00:24 --> 00:00:28
They're the ones that are able to
catalyze specific chemical reactions

7
00:00:28 --> 00:00:33
with all this amazing chemistry
that's needed for life to take place

8
00:00:33 --> 00:00:38
at physiological conditions.
They are structural components of

9
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
the cells.  They are all kinds of
amazing machines.

10
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
I showed you the little flagellar
motor that turns it,

11
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
but that's just one of many,
many nano machines that are

12
00:00:50 --> 00:00:55
necessary for life.
They have exquisite specificity

13
00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
when you get sick and you get an
immune response.

14
00:00:59 --> 00:01:03
You develop antibodies and other
cells that are able to recognize

15
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
exactly some piece of that virus or
bacterium that has infected you and

16
00:01:07 --> 00:01:12
mount an immune response.
But all of the things that are doing

17
00:01:12 --> 00:01:18
that are proteins.
And the sort of, most of you I

18
00:01:18 --> 00:01:23
think know that,
as we've sort of said that amino

19
00:01:23 --> 00:01:29
acids are just a chain,
one amino acid joined to another

20
00:01:29 --> 00:01:35
amino acid to another amino
acid and so on.

21
00:01:35 --> 00:01:39
And so the backbone,
that peptide bond that I showed the

22
00:01:39 --> 00:01:44
other day is absolutely regular
piece of backbone.

23
00:01:44 --> 00:01:49
And what gives the amino acids
their character is the side chain

24
00:01:49 --> 00:01:54
that hangs off.
And you'll have different side

25
00:01:54 --> 00:01:59
chains hanging off depending on what
the amino acid is.

26
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
And you will not have to memorize
all of those structures.

27
00:02:02 --> 00:02:06
But the important thing is that
these various amino acids fit into

28
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
chemical categories that give them
properties.  They either have a plus

29
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
charge and a negative charge,
they're hydrophobic, they don't like

30
00:02:14 --> 00:02:18
to go with water,
they are polar, they cannot interact

31
00:02:18 --> 00:02:22
with water and so on.
And it's clear from a couple of

32
00:02:22 --> 00:02:26
your comments,
some of you are why are we going

33
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
through all of this?
Well, the reason we're going through

34
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
all of this is all amino acids look
like this.  It doesn't matter.

35
00:02:35 --> 00:02:40
They're going to be an enzyme,
a part of a motor, a structural part

36
00:02:40 --> 00:02:45
of yourselves.
They all consist of the same

37
00:02:45 --> 00:02:50
backbone made up of those 20 amino
acids.  And what gives these,

38
00:02:50 --> 00:02:55
makes the proteins so important is
the ultimate 3-dimensional structure.

39
00:02:55 --> 00:03:00
I'm not sure what this sound is.
OK.  Let's try standing back here.

40
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
What gives all of these proteins
their individual character is how

41
00:03:04 --> 00:03:09
this chain of amino acids,
you could just think of them like

42
00:03:09 --> 00:03:14
this, folds up into some
3-dimensional structure that

43
00:03:14 --> 00:03:19
ultimately is able to do the
biological function that we're

44
00:03:19 --> 00:03:23
trying to understand.
And one of the real holy grails

45
00:03:23 --> 00:03:28
still in biology is how to look at
the sequence of amino acids that

46
00:03:28 --> 00:03:33
constitute a protein and figure out
what the 3-dimensional

47
00:03:33 --> 00:03:38
structure is.
It's one of the holy grails that

48
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
hasn't been solved.
One of you may have a key insight

49
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
that will solve this.
If we could do that it would really

50
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
be a huge advance,
because what you can get out of the

51
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
genome sequences is you can read the
sequence of every gene and you can

52
00:03:54 --> 00:03:58
predict the sequence of amino acids
in the protein.

53
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
But all it tells you is the linear
sequence of the amino acids.

54
00:04:02 --> 00:04:06
It doesn't tell you what the
3-dimensional structure is.

55
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
And how an amino acid gets from the
sort of floppy chain linear

56
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
structure to the 3-dimensional thing
is complicated.

57
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
And you have to understand several
kinds of forces.

58
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
And so I introduced a few terms.
When we think about protein

59
00:04:22 --> 00:04:27
structure, the primary structure,
that's just the linear sequence --

60
00:04:27 --> 00:04:35
-- of amino acids.

61
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
So valine followed by a tryptophan,
followed by a proline, followed a

62
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
threonine, whatever it would be.
That doesn't tell you very much.

63
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
Then the first key part of
understanding how proteins get to a

64
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
3-dimensional structure was the
discovery of what's termed

65
00:04:51 --> 00:05:00
secondary structure.

66
00:05:00 --> 00:05:05
And these are the thing I introduced
to you to the other day.

67
00:05:05 --> 00:05:10
There are two important ones.
An alpha helix and a beta sheet.

68
00:05:10 --> 00:05:15
And this is a propensity of a
certain string of amino acids in

69
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
this linear sequence to adopt one of
two very common protein structures.

70
00:05:20 --> 00:05:26
And the important thing about these
elements, the alpha helices and the

71
00:05:26 --> 00:05:31
beta sheets is they are not
dependent on the side chain.

72
00:05:31 --> 00:05:40
So they are not.

73
00:05:40 --> 00:05:44
They are instead dependent
on hydrogen bonds --

74
00:05:44 --> 00:05:55
-- between N-H and the carbon double

75
00:05:55 --> 00:06:03
bond oxygen in the backbone.
And that was how Linus Pauling

76
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
figured out originally the alpha
helix.  He decided to ignore all the

77
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
side chains.  And he worked out that
you could arrange the backbone of a

78
00:06:11 --> 00:06:16
protein, the peptide bonds into
these repeating structures that

79
00:06:16 --> 00:06:20
would account for the reflections
he'd seen.  When we get to talking

80
00:06:20 --> 00:06:24
about how Watson and Crick worked
out the structure,

81
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
that's how they started out, too.
They decided to ignore,

82
00:06:28 --> 00:06:32
if you will, the side chains,
which are the As and Gs and Cs and

83
00:06:32 --> 00:06:36
Ts, which turned out to be not a
productive way to go after the

84
00:06:36 --> 00:06:40
structure of DNA.
But, in any case,

85
00:06:40 --> 00:06:44
that was part of what Linus Pauling
did in working these out.

86
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
And so those little movies I showed
you, this is an alpha helix.

87
00:06:48 --> 00:06:52
Now, what's been done in this
picture is all the side chains have

88
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
been taken off.
And so you can look at this in your

89
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
textbook, you'll see pictures,
but these hydrogen bonds are --

90
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
The amino acid is just in this helix.
It's coiling around.

91
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
And at regular intervals there's
the opportunity for forming a

92
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
hydrogen bond.
And we can, with some success but

93
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
certainly not certainty,
predict that a particular sequence

94
00:07:13 --> 00:07:17
of amino acids is going to form an
alpha helix.  And part of what

95
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
that's based on is there are some
amino acids that don't fit easily

96
00:07:20 --> 00:07:23
into an alpha helix,
so they'll disrupt one if it ever

97
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
tried to form.
So that's one of the elements of

98
00:07:27 --> 00:07:31
protein structure.
So what you might get from this is

99
00:07:31 --> 00:07:36
the idea that somewhere along here
this little piece of the linear

100
00:07:36 --> 00:07:41
sequence is apt to be an alpha helix.
And you can represent that as this

101
00:07:41 --> 00:07:47
little sort of coil that you see in
these 3-dimensional structures.

102
00:07:47 --> 00:07:52
The other one, which is the beta
sheet, now that involves

103
00:07:52 --> 00:07:57
interactions between two pieces of,
two stretches of amino acids.  Maybe

104
00:07:57 --> 00:08:02
there was a loop in between.
And then you can get interactions

105
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
between them.  And that,
oops.  Let me just go, there's the

106
00:08:06 --> 00:08:10
beta sheet interaction.
Now, those are represented as

107
00:08:10 --> 00:08:14
arrows.  You know,
it takes two of them to go.

108
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
So you've got to have, to represent
a beta sheet in a 3-dimensional

109
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
structure you have to have two of
those broad arrows.

110
00:08:22 --> 00:08:27
And there was a question why were
there arrows on them?

111
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
Well, one of the things,
I think you can see if you look at

112
00:08:31 --> 00:08:35
those backbones,
is that both nucleic acid and

113
00:08:35 --> 00:08:39
protein backbones,
there's a polarity.

114
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
If you start in this direction,
the amino terminus, it's got a

115
00:08:43 --> 00:08:47
particular direction.
It's not symmetric.  If you come

116
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
back the other way you find carboxyl,
amino, the alpha carbon.

117
00:08:51 --> 00:08:55
And you'll find it in the opposite
order if you come back the other way.

118
00:08:55 --> 00:08:59
So there's an inherent polarity.
The arrows aren't represented on

119
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
here, but they are when you look at
it in 3-dimensions.

120
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
And you can either form beta sheets
where the two strands have the same

121
00:09:07 --> 00:09:12
polarity or, if in a case like that
where they loop back,

122
00:09:12 --> 00:09:16
then of course if this one was
pointing in this direction as it

123
00:09:16 --> 00:09:21
goes through the loop then the
opposite strand will be pointing in

124
00:09:21 --> 00:09:25
the other polarity,
one going this way and one going

125
00:09:25 --> 00:09:30
that way.  So this part
is sort of helpful.

126
00:09:30 --> 00:09:35
You can make guesses that maybe this
part has a tendency over here to

127
00:09:35 --> 00:09:40
form a beta sheet,
but you still haven't gotten very

128
00:09:40 --> 00:09:45
far towards understanding how you
get to the 3-dimensional structure.

129
00:09:45 --> 00:09:51
And just by putting on and
superimposing some amino acids onto

130
00:09:51 --> 00:09:56
that alpha helix then you can see
what happens, that if you form an

131
00:09:56 --> 00:10:02
alpha helix what happens is all the
side chains stick out.

132
00:10:02 --> 00:10:05
And now I think you can see,
those of you who are engineers

133
00:10:05 --> 00:10:09
anyway, if you wanted to build
something you have a cylinder and

134
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
you can stick amino acids out that
have particular chemical

135
00:10:12 --> 00:10:16
characteristics.
And depending on the

136
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
characteristics of those amino acids,
whether they have charges on them or

137
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
if they hate water or something,
that will influence what happens to

138
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
that component of the protein
structure when it gets into a

139
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
3-dimensional thing.
And, as I think I showed you the

140
00:10:30 --> 00:10:34
other day, when we caught it looking
down the end on this particular

141
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
example, here are a couple of
aromatic amino acids right here,

142
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
they're on the same side of the
helix and they would hate water.

143
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
Whereas, some of the other amino
acids up here are ones that have

144
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
charges so those would love water.
So what this would look like is a

145
00:10:47 --> 00:10:51
cylinder part of which hated water
and part of which loved water.

146
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
And you might guess it folded up in
3-dimensional space.

147
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
The part that hated water might
fold towards the inside

148
00:10:58 --> 00:11:02
of the protein.
And the part of the cylinder that

149
00:11:02 --> 00:11:08
loved water would face to the
outside.  So that's sort of the

150
00:11:08 --> 00:11:14
underlying principle.
So the rest of the other forces

151
00:11:14 --> 00:11:19
that we had to understand in order
to get to what's called the tertiary

152
00:11:19 --> 00:11:25
structure, this is the full 3D
structure, which we can now

153
00:11:25 --> 00:11:31
determine by a variety of methods.
X-ray crystallography of proteins

154
00:11:31 --> 00:11:36
is probably the most common.
The NMR, for example,

155
00:11:36 --> 00:11:40
can be used to derive a
3-dimensional structure as well.

156
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
And the other forces then that go
into this are ionic forces.

157
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49
Someone seemed confused by this,
but if you have a plus charge on

158
00:11:49 --> 00:11:54
this part of an amino acid and a
minus charge here,

159
00:11:54 --> 00:11:58
if in 3-dimensional space the plus
charge got somewhere near the minus

160
00:11:58 --> 00:12:03
charge then that would
form an ionic bond.

161
00:12:03 --> 00:12:07
And I think most of you know enough
electricity and magnetism that

162
00:12:07 --> 00:12:11
wouldn't surprise you that those two
would be attracted.

163
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
The one that I think that has been
harder to understand is van der

164
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19
Waals interactions that we talked
about the other day,

165
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
which is tricky in the sense that
for this course you don't

166
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
particularly really need to
understand the underlying

167
00:12:27 --> 00:12:32
chemistry.
But the principal of it is that if

168
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
you have a nonpolar bond,
one that hasn't got any particular

169
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
attraction to it,
gets very, very close to another one,

170
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
then the transient fluctuations in
one induce something in the other

171
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48
one that makes them stick together.
And the whole point about this is

172
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
if you get two molecular surfaces
that are very,

173
00:12:52 --> 00:12:56
very close together,
about, you know, many two times the

174
00:12:56 --> 00:13:00
length of a covalent bond or
something, then you can generate

175
00:13:00 --> 00:13:05
very powerful forces.
Because even though each individual

176
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
interaction is weak,
about a quarter or a third of a

177
00:13:09 --> 00:13:14
hydrogen bond,
summing them up can make them very,

178
00:13:14 --> 00:13:18
very strong.  And so that's another
kind of force that's important when

179
00:13:18 --> 00:13:22
a linear molecule is trying to
figure out how in space it's going

180
00:13:22 --> 00:13:27
to fold up.  The point of the gecko
thing was it's only relatively

181
00:13:27 --> 00:13:31
recently been discovered that the
reason those lizards can stick to

182
00:13:31 --> 00:13:36
walls is they have sort of
incredible split ends.

183
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
I noticed a couple of you came to
Bob Full's talk the other day and

184
00:13:40 --> 00:13:44
you got to hear the full treatment.
But because the hairs on their feet

185
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
are so split they're very fine and
the molecules are able to make very

186
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
close interactions,
van der Waals interactions with the

187
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
surface.  And that's what's holding
the gecko to the wall.

188
00:13:56 --> 00:14:01
And there are just so many of them
that it can support a whole gecko.

189
00:14:01 --> 00:14:05
And that's what could be the basis
of, he said to me,

190
00:14:05 --> 00:14:09
a $30 to $50 billion adhesive
industry, a self-cleaning dry

191
00:14:09 --> 00:14:14
adhesive.  And it's not something
magic only the gecko hair will do.

192
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
You can design synthetic molecules
that have the same property and are

193
00:14:18 --> 00:14:23
able to make these millions of van
der Waals interactions.

194
00:14:23 --> 00:14:27
So that's two of the other things.
And the final thing, which isn't

195
00:14:27 --> 00:14:32
really a force but goes into this,
is this hydrophobic effect.

196
00:14:32 --> 00:14:36
And that is that if we have things,
amino acids such as valine or

197
00:14:36 --> 00:14:40
something that doesn't like to mix
with water, then when the protein

198
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
folds up, the things that don't like
to interact with water will kind of

199
00:14:44 --> 00:14:49
go together just the way if you put
a lot of oil in the water it will

200
00:14:49 --> 00:14:53
sort of pull together.
Because any time you have something

201
00:14:53 --> 00:14:57
that gets stuck in water,
it disrupts hydrogen bonds and

202
00:14:57 --> 00:15:02
that's energetically unfavorable.
So the things that hate water will

203
00:15:02 --> 00:15:06
tend to lump together.
And you're all used to seeing

204
00:15:06 --> 00:15:10
little drops of oil and stuff
floating around.

205
00:15:10 --> 00:15:14
And let me switch over to this
other thing now.

206
00:15:14 --> 00:15:23
So this was just showing you one of

207
00:15:23 --> 00:15:27
these protein chains that's folded
up into a 3-dimensional structure.

208
00:15:27 --> 00:15:32
This happens to be something with
an enzymatic activity.

209
00:15:32 --> 00:15:35
But the important thing for right
now is what's been colored in here

210
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
are the amino acids that if you look
back on the list of amino acids and

211
00:15:38 --> 00:15:42
what categories are,
you'd see some of them are said to

212
00:15:42 --> 00:15:45
have hydrophobic side chains.
You can see quite strikingly how

213
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
the amino acids in the interior part
of this protein have clustered

214
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
together.  They don't like to
interact with water.

215
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
They interact very well with each
other.  Just like you can mix butter

216
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
and oil, they mix together
very well.

217
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
And so that is another factor that
contributes to the 3-dimensional

218
00:16:03 --> 00:16:07
structure of these proteins.
So understanding what proteins are

219
00:16:07 --> 00:16:12
all about means ultimately
understanding their 3-dimensional

220
00:16:12 --> 00:16:16
structure.  And,
as I say, a big unsolved problem

221
00:16:16 --> 00:16:21
right at the moment is how do you
get from a linear chain of amino

222
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
acids to one of these 3-dimensional
structures?  And you can imagine

223
00:16:25 --> 00:16:29
with 20 different side chains
there's an unbelievable number of

224
00:16:29 --> 00:16:34
combinations that you can make.
Yet almost every protein in nature

225
00:16:34 --> 00:16:38
has one unique or one or two or
something confirmations that takes

226
00:16:38 --> 00:16:43
out, out of all the kinds of things
that you could do.

227
00:16:43 --> 00:16:48
And it's this combination of forces
that does that.

228
00:16:48 --> 00:16:52
You know, let me just go back for
one second.  So the final thing that

229
00:16:52 --> 00:16:57
ones talks about when you're talking
about proteins are quaternary

230
00:16:57 --> 00:17:02
structure.
And what that means is when you have

231
00:17:02 --> 00:17:07
more than one polypeptide chain,
so if we have two different proteins

232
00:17:07 --> 00:17:13
that interact,
this is protein number one and this

233
00:17:13 --> 00:17:18
is protein number two,
then there has to be some sort of

234
00:17:18 --> 00:17:23
interaction between each of these
three dimensional structures in

235
00:17:23 --> 00:17:29
order for the proteins
to stick together.

236
00:17:29 --> 00:17:33
Something like that flagellar motor
that let's the bacteria swim,

237
00:17:33 --> 00:17:37
has many, many parts, all of which
have to fit together just the same

238
00:17:37 --> 00:17:42
way all the different parts of an
engine have to fit together.

239
00:17:42 --> 00:17:46
Now this next little movie is just
a dimer.  It's actually a

240
00:17:46 --> 00:17:50
heterodimer so it's made of two
proteins.  They're different but

241
00:17:50 --> 00:17:55
they've come together and they're
interaction.  So what you will first

242
00:17:55 --> 00:17:59
see is the 3-dimensional structure
of each protein showing the alpha

243
00:17:59 --> 00:18:04
helices, the beta sheets,
and nothing else is shown.

244
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
The side chains aren't shown.
The molecular surfaces aren't shown.

245
00:18:07 --> 00:18:10
You can just see the backbone.
You'll see alpha helix a turn, some

246
00:18:10 --> 00:18:13
beta sheets, just the kind of stuff
you were seeing the other day.

247
00:18:13 --> 00:18:17
But you'll see that the two
proteins are together.

248
00:18:17 --> 00:18:20
And this is actually a movie made
by Tom Schwartz who's a

249
00:18:20 --> 00:18:23
crystallogram who just started on
our facility this fall in the

250
00:18:23 --> 00:18:26
biology department.
It's one of the proteins he studied.

251
00:18:26 --> 00:18:30
And then after that he rotates it
around so you can see it.

252
00:18:30 --> 00:18:33
After that he then puts on the side
chains and then traces the surface.

253
00:18:33 --> 00:18:37
So this is what they call the van
der Waals surface.

254
00:18:37 --> 00:18:41
So this is what the protein would
actually look like.

255
00:18:41 --> 00:18:45
And what I think you'll see from
this is how incredibly well the

256
00:18:45 --> 00:18:49
proteins fit together.
The theme I'll probably keep saying

257
00:18:49 --> 00:18:53
all the way through the course is
biology works from fitting shapes.

258
00:18:53 --> 00:18:57
And things have to work incredibly
well, and that's also why these van

259
00:18:57 --> 00:19:01
der Waals forces become
so important.

260
00:19:01 --> 00:19:04
Because evolution has ended up
making things that just go together

261
00:19:04 --> 00:19:07
just like a hand in a perfectly fit
glove.  That's the way most of these

262
00:19:07 --> 00:19:11
interactions are.
So watch this little movie.

263
00:19:11 --> 00:19:14
So the light blue is one of the
proteins.  There's an alpha helix.

264
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
There are a lot of alpha helices in
this one.  And the purple one is the

265
00:19:18 --> 00:19:21
other protein.
And you can see that in between

266
00:19:21 --> 00:19:25
them there's an interface.
And so those must be interacting.

267
00:19:25 --> 00:19:29
But when he superimposes now all the
amino acids in the surface,

268
00:19:29 --> 00:19:33
now what he's going to do, he's
going to pull those apart so you can

269
00:19:33 --> 00:19:42
see where they were interacting.

270
00:19:42 --> 00:19:45
Do you get the idea now of how
beautifully these things have folded

271
00:19:45 --> 00:19:49
up in 3-dimensional space in
positions so that they can fit

272
00:19:49 --> 00:19:53
together and work together as a
machine?  Just the same way if you

273
00:19:53 --> 00:19:57
were building a machine and you
needed to have two parts that you

274
00:19:57 --> 00:20:01
had to join together you've got a
tool thing so that the surfaces go

275
00:20:01 --> 00:20:04
exactly together.
That's what nature does.

276
00:20:04 --> 00:20:08
That's also why I'm making such a
deal out of this 3-dimensioanl

277
00:20:08 --> 00:20:11
structure of proteins and how it got
there.  I could just say it gets

278
00:20:11 --> 00:20:14
there by magic,
but it doesn't.  It's determined by

279
00:20:14 --> 00:20:18
this set of forces.
And one of the things we cannot do

280
00:20:18 --> 00:20:21
at this point is predict.
Here's a linear sequence of amino

281
00:20:21 --> 00:20:24
acids.  Here's the 3D structure.
That would be a huge advance in

282
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
biology if one of you guys could
figure out how to do that

283
00:20:28 --> 00:20:33
during your career.
OK.  So I just want to reiterate

284
00:20:33 --> 00:20:39
some of the things that proteins do
because we'll be talking about them

285
00:20:39 --> 00:20:45
as we go along.
One thing they do,

286
00:20:45 --> 00:20:51
they act as enzymes which are
catalysts for biological reactions

287
00:20:51 --> 00:20:57
that take place under physiological
conditions.  And we'll give you a

288
00:20:57 --> 00:21:03
lot of examples of those enzymes
starting very soon.

289
00:21:03 --> 00:21:07
They play structural roles.
Our hair, our fingernails are made

290
00:21:07 --> 00:21:12
of protein.  The hairs on the
gecko's feet are made of keratin

291
00:21:12 --> 00:21:16
which is the same stuff our hair is
made of, except they basically got a

292
00:21:16 --> 00:21:21
whole lot of split ends.
They're finer hairs to begin with

293
00:21:21 --> 00:21:26
and a lot of split ends.
And that's what makes these very,

294
00:21:26 --> 00:21:30
very fine things that can make van
der Waals interactions

295
00:21:30 --> 00:21:35
with surfaces.
They play roles in specificity.

296
00:21:35 --> 00:21:41
For example, I mentioned the
antibodies.  And we'll talk about

297
00:21:41 --> 00:21:47
the immune response in some detail
at the end of the course.

298
00:21:47 --> 00:21:52
And one of the really magic things
that we've come to understand in

299
00:21:52 --> 00:21:58
biology recently is how it is that
your body has this immune system

300
00:21:58 --> 00:22:04
that's able to recognize literally
any molecule, any molecule.

301
00:22:04 --> 00:22:08
It doesn't matter whether it is
existed or you and your PhD thesis

302
00:22:08 --> 00:22:12
in chemistry synthesize something
the world has never seen before,

303
00:22:12 --> 00:22:16
your immune system can create an
antibody or something that will very,

304
00:22:16 --> 00:22:21
very specifically recognize that
particular shape in just the same

305
00:22:21 --> 00:22:25
sort of way that you saw the shape
on that movie.

306
00:22:25 --> 00:22:29
And you might think you'd need to
code a zillion millions of DNA in

307
00:22:29 --> 00:22:34
order to do that.
But there's a trick using

308
00:22:34 --> 00:22:39
combinatorial functions and mutation
that lets your body do that.

309
00:22:39 --> 00:22:44
Another example, which I was
showing you, that can do all sorts

310
00:22:44 --> 00:22:49
of little motors and machines,
I showed you the bacteria swimming

311
00:22:49 --> 00:22:54
around.  These are just E.
coli.  And you cannot see the

312
00:22:54 --> 00:22:59
flagellar motors,
but you can see them buzzing around

313
00:22:59 --> 00:23:04
just under a cover slip.
Some of them are stuck to the cover

314
00:23:04 --> 00:23:08
slip.  There we go.
In this one, which was taken by

315
00:23:08 --> 00:23:12
Howard Burge who is a professor at
Harvard, I just took this off his

316
00:23:12 --> 00:23:16
website, you can see the bacteria
swimming by having these flagella

317
00:23:16 --> 00:23:20
which are basically like sort of
propellers more or less that they

318
00:23:20 --> 00:23:24
turn.  Here's one where he used the
strobe so you can get a little bit

319
00:23:24 --> 00:23:28
better view of it.
And I showed you this picture in

320
00:23:28 --> 00:23:32
the first lecture.
So that's the machine,

321
00:23:32 --> 00:23:36
but every single part of that
machine is made of a protein that's

322
00:23:36 --> 00:23:40
got a very certain 3-dimensional
space.  And we're going to start

323
00:23:40 --> 00:23:44
talking about energetics,
how does this cell get energy?

324
00:23:44 --> 00:23:47
And one of the things you might
wonder is if you were to design such

325
00:23:47 --> 00:23:51
a nano machine how would you power
it?  They exist.

326
00:23:51 --> 00:23:55
I mean it's here.
But that's why in part I'm going to

327
00:23:55 --> 00:23:59
start talking about energy and how
cells make energy,

328
00:23:59 --> 00:24:03
because this is one of the things
they have to do.

329
00:24:03 --> 00:24:06
And that was, as I said,
was an average electron micrograph

330
00:24:06 --> 00:24:10
of a lot of those motors.
So you can see that although,

331
00:24:10 --> 00:24:13
you know, that's the textbook thing,
the actual thing is pretty much the

332
00:24:13 --> 00:24:17
same shape.  This is not at a
resolution where you can make out

333
00:24:17 --> 00:24:20
the individual proteins that put it
together, but some of those are

334
00:24:20 --> 00:24:24
starting to be known in
3-dimensional detail.

335
00:24:24 --> 00:24:28
And I thought you might enjoy
seeing this just to convince you

336
00:24:28 --> 00:24:31
it's a motor.  In this thing,
what Howard Burge did was he stuck

337
00:24:31 --> 00:24:35
the propeller,
if you will, the flagellar to a

338
00:24:35 --> 00:24:38
cover slip using an antibody.
And then he let them do their thing.

339
00:24:38 --> 00:24:42
And normally they would be turning
the propeller and swimming,

340
00:24:42 --> 00:24:45
but if the propeller is attached the
same thing would happen if you held

341
00:24:45 --> 00:24:49
onto the propeller of a boat and
turned on the motor the boat would

342
00:24:49 --> 00:24:52
start twirling around.
And what you're seeing here is

343
00:24:52 --> 00:24:56
bacterial that are twirling around
because their flagellar

344
00:24:56 --> 00:25:00
are stuck on.
And those of you who are observant

345
00:25:00 --> 00:25:04
will notice even that they change
direction.  And that's part of the

346
00:25:04 --> 00:25:08
system that bacteria use so they can
swim towards a food source or away

347
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
from another one.
OK.  Here's just something to let

348
00:25:12 --> 00:25:17
you think about it.
If anybody can figure this out send

349
00:25:17 --> 00:25:21
me an email.  Here's something else.
The phenomenon I'm going to show

350
00:25:21 --> 00:25:25
you is due to a protein made by a
soil bacterium called Pseudomonas

351
00:25:25 --> 00:25:30
syringae.  You don't
need to know that.

352
00:25:30 --> 00:25:34
It associated with plants.
And what you're going to see is a

353
00:25:34 --> 00:25:38
little movie made by a couple of
post-docs in my lab where they took

354
00:25:38 --> 00:25:42
pure water.  And if it's pure water
you can cool it below freezing.

355
00:25:42 --> 00:25:47
You can get it down to, I don't
know, minus eight degrees centigrade

356
00:25:47 --> 00:25:51
and it still will be a liquid,
even though you know water freezes

357
00:25:51 --> 00:25:55
at zero degrees centigrade.
And what it has to do in order to

358
00:25:55 --> 00:25:59
turn into ice,
somewhere you have to nucleate the

359
00:25:59 --> 00:26:04
formation of an ice crystal.
And once it goes,

360
00:26:04 --> 00:26:08
going.  So, anyway,
what you're going to see is some

361
00:26:08 --> 00:26:12
super- cooled water they've made.
You can see there is zero degrees

362
00:26:12 --> 00:26:16
there.  And this is Metchitaga,
one of the post-docs in my lab.

363
00:26:16 --> 00:26:20
That's the super-cooled water.
She's taking a little bit of

364
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
culture of this Pseudomonas syringae,
and she's just going to put it in,

365
00:26:24 --> 00:26:29
give a little tiny squirt, a few
micro-liters into that water.

366
00:26:29 --> 00:26:33
Now it's going all cloudy.
And now you might wonder what's

367
00:26:33 --> 00:26:37
happening there.
But, as you'll discovery,

368
00:26:37 --> 00:26:41
what happened is that what was
liquid water is now ice.

369
00:26:41 --> 00:26:48
That is due to one protein that this

370
00:26:48 --> 00:26:52
bacterium makes and displays on its
surface.  And here's a controlled

371
00:26:52 --> 00:26:57
experiment.  This is putting in a
little bit of rhizobium meliloti,

372
00:26:57 --> 00:27:02
another soil organism, and the same
amount of bacteria.

373
00:27:02 --> 00:27:09
It didn't happen.
OK.  So that's due to a protein

374
00:27:09 --> 00:27:17
that was on the surface of that
bacterium.  Anybody have any idea

375
00:27:17 --> 00:27:24
what that could do?
Send me an email.  OK.

376
00:27:24 --> 00:27:32
There's one last class of
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] macromolecule.

377
00:27:32 --> 00:27:36
Those are lipids.
These are a little different in the

378
00:27:36 --> 00:27:40
sense that this is not know a long
chain made by joining together

379
00:27:40 --> 00:27:44
subunits as you see with the
proteins and nucleic acids,

380
00:27:44 --> 00:27:49
but putting together the parts
necessary to make a lipid involve

381
00:27:49 --> 00:27:53
the same principle,
that you end up splitting out water

382
00:27:53 --> 00:27:58
molecules.  That's a theme you've
heard over and over again.

383
00:27:58 --> 00:28:03
And if we take three long chain,
three fatty acids, some number of

384
00:28:03 --> 00:28:10
carbons --

385
00:28:10 --> 00:28:25
Some number of carbons.

386
00:28:25 --> 00:28:33
Just some arbitrary number here.
And then we take a three carbon

387
00:28:33 --> 00:28:41
compound that has three hydroxyl
groups.  Now, this is not a

388
00:28:41 --> 00:28:48
carbohydrate because you'll notice
there's not a double bond oxygen as

389
00:28:48 --> 00:28:56
you saw in the carbohydrates.
It's actually an alcohol that's

390
00:28:56 --> 00:29:04
known as glycerol.
And if we split out water like this

391
00:29:04 --> 00:29:12
what you get is a fat,
something you're familiar with from

392
00:29:12 --> 00:29:20
beef fat.  Or if you get something
like olive oil,

393
00:29:20 --> 00:29:28
you've heard the term unsaturated
fats.

394
00:29:28 --> 00:29:32
Maybe you'll recall from the second
lecture that if we had a single

395
00:29:32 --> 00:29:36
covalent bond,
or if we had a double or a triple

396
00:29:36 --> 00:29:40
bond that was called an unsaturated
bond.  So if you have an unsaturated

397
00:29:40 --> 00:29:45
bond in here somewhere then you end
up with an unsaturated fat.

398
00:29:45 --> 00:29:49
And most of you know probably
something like beef fat is solid.

399
00:29:49 --> 00:29:53
If you put it in a refrigerator
something like peanut oil

400
00:29:53 --> 00:29:59
will stay liquid.
And that's because if you have just

401
00:29:59 --> 00:30:05
saturated side chains from this then
they pack together very tightly and

402
00:30:05 --> 00:30:11
they will form a solid.
If you put a double bond in then

403
00:30:11 --> 00:30:17
there's a kink in the backbone and
it's hard for these things to pack

404
00:30:17 --> 00:30:23
together.  And that's why they're
called unsaturated fats.

405
00:30:23 --> 00:30:29
Now, there's a very particular kind
of lipid that's of unbelievable

406
00:30:29 --> 00:30:35
importance in biology known
as a phospholipid.

407
00:30:35 --> 00:30:39
And the reason that's so important
is that that is the boundary that

408
00:30:39 --> 00:30:43
determines the outside of a cell.
So every cell, every organism

409
00:30:43 --> 00:30:47
either is a single cell or is made
up of multiple cells.

410
00:30:47 --> 00:30:51
And, as I said in the first lecture,
that one of the secrets to life is

411
00:30:51 --> 00:30:55
having a boundary that goes around
your insides it separates your

412
00:30:55 --> 00:31:00
insides from all the rest
of the universe.

413
00:31:00 --> 00:31:08
And the way these membranes,
as they're called, are made of is

414
00:31:08 --> 00:31:17
what's known as a phospholipid
bilayer.  And it's the same

415
00:31:17 --> 00:31:25
principle as before.
It uses a glycerol, except that one

416
00:31:25 --> 00:31:34
of the fatty acids is replaced by a
phosphate group that will have some

417
00:31:34 --> 00:31:44
kind decoration added onto it.
And the other will have fatty acids

418
00:31:44 --> 00:31:59
at the other two positions.

419
00:31:59 --> 00:32:04
Now, you'll notice by splitting out
water here, the kind of bond that we

420
00:32:04 --> 00:32:10
have created, the chemical name of
this is an ester bond.

421
00:32:10 --> 00:32:16
And if we wanted to break it we
could add water back across it.

422
00:32:16 --> 00:32:22
So what's important about this
molecule is this part of the

423
00:32:22 --> 00:32:28
molecule, if you will,
is water-loving because the very

424
00:32:28 --> 00:32:34
polar bonds here,
the oxygen here would have a

425
00:32:34 --> 00:32:40
negative charge under physiological
conditions.

426
00:32:40 --> 00:32:46
And this part is,
if you will, water-hating.

427
00:32:46 --> 00:32:52
So phospholipids are often
represented in the following way

428
00:32:52 --> 00:32:58
where this is the water-loving and
then this would be the water-hating

429
00:32:58 --> 00:33:05
part here.
And so if you take phospholipids and

430
00:33:05 --> 00:33:12
you just try and disperse them in
water, they spontaneously

431
00:33:12 --> 00:33:20
self-assemble into structures that
bring the water-loving parts

432
00:33:20 --> 00:33:27
together and the water-hating parts
together.  And by so doing this they

433
00:33:27 --> 00:33:35
form what's known as a
phospholipid bilayer.

434
00:33:35 --> 00:33:40
And that's what this membrane is
made of.  Membrane of bacterial cell,

435
00:33:40 --> 00:33:45
membrane of our cells virtually the
same thing.  It has the property

436
00:33:45 --> 00:33:50
that is not permeable to very much.
Water can get across a very limited

437
00:33:50 --> 00:33:56
number of other chemical compounds,
but most things cannot.

438
00:33:56 --> 00:34:00
And so, by having this membrane,
what the cell is able to do then is

439
00:34:00 --> 00:34:05
control who comes in and who comes
out.  And the way it does that is it

440
00:34:05 --> 00:34:09
has to put particular importers or
exporters imbedded in the membrane

441
00:34:09 --> 00:34:14
that can carry out those functions.
Because, as you would guess, any

442
00:34:14 --> 00:34:18
system would have to bring stuff in,
get rid of waste, you'd have to be

443
00:34:18 --> 00:34:23
able to go back and forth.
The things that do all those

444
00:34:23 --> 00:34:27
transports across the membrane are,
what kind of molecule do you think

445
00:34:27 --> 00:34:32
it likely to be?
If nature was going to design

446
00:34:32 --> 00:34:36
something that was a pump to get
something in or something that would

447
00:34:36 --> 00:34:41
get something out,
any idea what kind of molecule?

448
00:34:41 --> 00:34:46
Take a guess given what I've said
so far.  Protein.

449
00:34:46 --> 00:34:50
Yeah.  Absolutely.
And let me just sort of show you a

450
00:34:50 --> 00:34:55
couple little pictures here.
So here's a representation of this

451
00:34:55 --> 00:35:00
phospholipid bilayer.
This is pretty standard stuff.

452
00:35:00 --> 00:35:04
This is what you'd put on a
blackboard.  Here's in gray now the

453
00:35:04 --> 00:35:08
phospholipid.  And here's one of
these proteins,

454
00:35:08 --> 00:35:12
a picture of one of these proteins
that functions to get things across

455
00:35:12 --> 00:35:16
the membrane.  And hopefully what
you can see now is that it's made up

456
00:35:16 --> 00:35:20
of a whole lot of alpha helices,
and they pack together to give sort

457
00:35:20 --> 00:35:24
of a cylinder made up of different
alpha helices that weave in out like

458
00:35:24 --> 00:35:28
this.  And then by this sort of
trick the protein is able to create

459
00:35:28 --> 00:35:32
a channel that runs up and down the
middle of this protein that's

460
00:35:32 --> 00:35:36
imbedded in the membrane.
And then, depending on the

461
00:35:36 --> 00:35:40
characteristics that channel,
it can either be used to bring stuff

462
00:35:40 --> 00:35:44
in or get rid of it.
There is a more fanciful depiction

463
00:35:44 --> 00:35:48
of it.  This is not reality,
but there you are with the

464
00:35:48 --> 00:35:52
water-loving parts.
Here are the fatty acids going in.

465
00:35:52 --> 00:35:56
And this is supposed to be one of
these membrane proteins.

466
00:35:56 --> 00:36:00
Now, this next movie is trying to
pretend here that it's looking at

467
00:36:00 --> 00:36:04
one of these membrane proteins
colored here in red as it

468
00:36:04 --> 00:36:08
spans the membrane.
So here's looking from the membrane

469
00:36:08 --> 00:36:12
surface on.  And now it's going to
dive into this thing as it crossed

470
00:36:12 --> 00:36:16
the membrane.  And basically what
this movie is letting you do is feel

471
00:36:16 --> 00:36:20
like if you were the molecule that's
being transported across the

472
00:36:20 --> 00:36:24
membrane you'd see how you'd go
right down through a channel in the

473
00:36:24 --> 00:36:28
middle of the protein.
So that's one of the underlying

474
00:36:28 --> 00:36:32
principals then,
is that you have a phospholipid

475
00:36:32 --> 00:36:37
boundary that's critical for life.
But then to have everything else

476
00:36:37 --> 00:36:41
that needs to happen the cell makes
a series of proteins that function

477
00:36:41 --> 00:36:46
either to bring stuff in or to bring
it out.  Or in the case of something

478
00:36:46 --> 00:36:51
like the flagellar motor we talked
about it has to imbed a part of the

479
00:36:51 --> 00:36:55
machinery right in the membrane.
And one last picture I just want to

480
00:36:55 --> 00:37:00
show you.
Usually, even on that movie,

481
00:37:00 --> 00:37:04
you tend to see the cell represented
something like this with a membrane

482
00:37:04 --> 00:37:09
and every once in a while there's a
protein.  This is a cartoon but it

483
00:37:09 --> 00:37:13
is much closer to a to-scale drawing.
This is an E.

484
00:37:13 --> 00:37:18
coli cell.  Now,
they have an extra membrane that we

485
00:37:18 --> 00:37:23
won't worry about right for the
moment.  But right there,

486
00:37:23 --> 00:37:27
this little piece that we can see
little bits of, is the

487
00:37:27 --> 00:37:31
cell's membrane.
And what this picture is showing is

488
00:37:31 --> 00:37:35
that this membrane is just
absolutely studded with membrane

489
00:37:35 --> 00:37:38
proteins that are going to carry out
various functions.

490
00:37:38 --> 00:37:42
And here actually we're seeing that
motor which is imbedded both in the

491
00:37:42 --> 00:37:45
inner and outer membrane.
And there's the motor going off.

492
00:37:45 --> 00:37:49
But a couple of things maybe you
can take home from this is there are

493
00:37:49 --> 00:37:52
a lot of proteins stuck in those
membranes that control what goes in

494
00:37:52 --> 00:37:56
and out.  You also get a sense in
here of how crowded

495
00:37:56 --> 00:38:00
the cytoplasm is.
The proteins are really at amazingly

496
00:38:00 --> 00:38:06
high concentrations when they're
inside the cytoplasm.

497
00:38:06 --> 00:38:12
OK.  So that's sort of a quick
survey.  It's nothing more that a

498
00:38:12 --> 00:38:17
really superficial introduction to
the four classes of biomolecules.

499
00:38:17 --> 00:38:23
But to go any farther we're going
to have to think a little bit now

500
00:38:23 --> 00:38:29
about of the characteristics
of living cells.

501
00:38:29 --> 00:38:33
I don't know if any of you know if
any of you know what this is,

502
00:38:33 --> 00:38:38
but this is bakers yeast.  If you
were making bread you know you put

503
00:38:38 --> 00:38:43
some yeast in it and it divides and
it gives off carbon dioxide as a

504
00:38:43 --> 00:38:48
waste product and makes the bread
rise.  And what's happened in that

505
00:38:48 --> 00:38:52
little movie you just saw were two
cells dividing to give four,

506
00:38:52 --> 00:38:57
and four dividing to get eight,
and I don't know what we're up to

507
00:38:57 --> 00:39:02
here, but you can see a cell grow.
That's sped up.

508
00:39:02 --> 00:39:07
It takes probably something closer
to an hour for a cell division to

509
00:39:07 --> 00:39:12
take place.  But this is the kind of
thing that microorganisms do when

510
00:39:12 --> 00:39:18
they grow, is you can start with a
single cell and it will make two

511
00:39:18 --> 00:39:23
cells that are identical to itself
and those will make four.

512
00:39:23 --> 00:39:28
And what happens when we start out
as a single cell,

513
00:39:28 --> 00:39:32
we start out initially like this.
And we make cells that are identical

514
00:39:32 --> 00:39:36
at the beginning.
And those are the famous embryonic

515
00:39:36 --> 00:39:40
stem cells, because at this point
they can become any cell in your

516
00:39:40 --> 00:39:44
body.  And if you're a yeast it
doesn't matter.

517
00:39:44 --> 00:39:48
Everything you make is the same.
If it's a human, once you start

518
00:39:48 --> 00:39:52
dividing at some point cells are
going to have to start making

519
00:39:52 --> 00:39:56
decisions and the progeny will have
to start to be different of each

520
00:39:56 --> 00:40:00
other so that you can have something
that's an eye and another cell

521
00:40:00 --> 00:40:04
that's in the liver and so on.
And we'll talk a little bit about

522
00:40:04 --> 00:40:08
that as we go on.
But the major point,

523
00:40:08 --> 00:40:13
right at this point, is that all of
life involves one cell dividing and

524
00:40:13 --> 00:40:17
giving a couple of other cells,
and then those going on.  So these

525
00:40:17 --> 00:40:22
cells, as we've said,
characteristics of organisms which

526
00:40:22 --> 00:40:26
are to be true at their cellular
level as well is that they carry out

527
00:40:26 --> 00:40:31
metabolism, they undergo
regulated growth.

528
00:40:31 --> 00:40:36
And you have a nice example of yeast
undergoing regulated growth and they

529
00:40:36 --> 00:40:41
reproduce, which in the case of a
single-celled organism is the same

530
00:40:41 --> 00:40:46
as cell division.
For us reproducing is a lot more

531
00:40:46 --> 00:40:52
complicated because we have to make
a whole other multicellular organism

532
00:40:52 --> 00:40:57
where the cells have differentiated
functions, but the point about that

533
00:40:57 --> 00:41:03
is there has to be an unbelievable
amount of synthesis.

534
00:41:03 --> 00:41:07
The DNA in our body,
we start out with two meters in a

535
00:41:07 --> 00:41:11
fertilized cell,
and we have ten to the fourteenth

536
00:41:11 --> 00:41:16
cells by the time we're an adult.
So we've had to make a tremendous

537
00:41:16 --> 00:41:20
amount of DNA let alone protein and
everything else.

538
00:41:20 --> 00:41:25
And something almost all of you
know from your engineering

539
00:41:25 --> 00:41:29
background from this place is that
you need energy in order

540
00:41:29 --> 00:41:35
to synthesize material.
And what we'll start to talk about

541
00:41:35 --> 00:41:41
in the next phase of this course
then is how do cells make energy and

542
00:41:41 --> 00:41:47
how do they carry out metabolism.
So I'm going to, just before we do

543
00:41:47 --> 00:41:53
that, introduce to you very quickly,
to close out here, two classes of

544
00:41:53 --> 00:42:00
organisms that we find in nature.
We find organisms that are known as

545
00:42:00 --> 00:42:06
autotrophs.  These are certain
bacteria, and they're able to make

546
00:42:06 --> 00:42:13
everything they need starting with
CO2, ammonia, phosphate,

547
00:42:13 --> 00:42:20
water, a few things, but that's all
they need.  So,

548
00:42:20 --> 00:42:26
for example, an organism that lives,
a bacterium that lives out in the

549
00:42:26 --> 00:42:33
open ocean is able to make
everything from those very,

550
00:42:33 --> 00:42:43
very simple basic building blocks.
Heterotrophs need to eat --

551
00:42:43 --> 00:42:52
-- some things made by

552
00:42:52 --> 00:43:06
other organisms.

553
00:43:06 --> 00:43:09
An example of a heterotroph that
you're familiar with,

554
00:43:09 --> 00:43:13
that I'm familiar with is us.
You probably remember your mother

555
00:43:13 --> 00:43:17
reminding you,
as you're about to have yet another

556
00:43:17 --> 00:43:20
hotdog, that it was important to eat
your vitamins.

557
00:43:20 --> 00:43:24
The reason you need to eat vitamins,
those are things we absolutely need

558
00:43:24 --> 00:43:28
for our life but we cannot make them
ourselves.  Vitamin C is

559
00:43:28 --> 00:43:32
one you probably know.
It has an interesting history how

560
00:43:32 --> 00:43:36
people figured this out.
It was sailors at sea got really,

561
00:43:36 --> 00:43:40
really sick.  Their teeth would
start to loosen,

562
00:43:40 --> 00:43:44
they would start to bleed and they
would die.  Some of the famous sea

563
00:43:44 --> 00:43:48
voyages you heard about in high
school, I think the Cape of Good

564
00:43:48 --> 00:43:52
Hope, on that trip where that was
discovered 100 out of the 160

565
00:43:52 --> 00:43:56
sailors died at sea because of
scurvy.  Now, scurvy turns out to be

566
00:43:56 --> 00:44:00
due to not having vitamin C.
And there was finally a guy,

567
00:44:00 --> 00:44:04
Lind, I'm just blanking on his first
name at the moment,

568
00:44:04 --> 00:44:08
in about the 1700s who was a naval
surgeon in the British Navy who

569
00:44:08 --> 00:44:12
actually figured out that if you
gave sailors lemon juice that they

570
00:44:12 --> 00:44:17
didn't get scurvy.
It was a controlled experiment.

571
00:44:17 --> 00:44:21
It took about 50 years.  I think it
was 1795 when they started to

572
00:44:21 --> 00:44:25
finally give the sailors lemon juice
and stopped having this terrible

573
00:44:25 --> 00:44:29
sickness amongst their sailors.
And then in about 1950 they

574
00:44:29 --> 00:44:33
substituted lime juice.
And some of you may still know the

575
00:44:33 --> 00:44:37
British sailors are called limeys.
And that was because of this

576
00:44:37 --> 00:44:40
solution they found to avoiding
scurvy.  And what was really

577
00:44:40 --> 00:44:44
happening was they were finding a
way to provide vitamin C which is in

578
00:44:44 --> 00:44:48
fresh fruits and vegetables which
wasn't part of the classic sailor

579
00:44:48 --> 00:44:51
diet which was sort of biscuits and
dried meat during long voyages at

580
00:44:51 --> 00:44:55
sea.  And there are several other
vitamins, but the reason they're

581
00:44:55 --> 00:44:59
called vitamins is they're things
that you body cannot make but other

582
00:44:59 --> 00:45:05
organisms can.
The other thing that we cannot make,

583
00:45:05 --> 00:45:14
we can make some of our 20 amino
acids, but there are eight amino

584
00:45:14 --> 00:45:23
acids that we cannot make,
lysine, methionine, lucien,

585
00:45:23 --> 00:45:33
isoleucine, valine, threonine,
phenylalanine and tryptophan.

586
00:45:33 --> 00:45:38
And this actually has consequences
for us because those of you who are

587
00:45:38 --> 00:45:43
vegetarians probably know you have
to be kind of careful about your

588
00:45:43 --> 00:45:48
diet.  If you're eating animal
protein you're getting essentially

589
00:45:48 --> 00:45:53
all the different amino acids,
but if you're a vegetarian you have

590
00:45:53 --> 00:45:58
to be careful because the major food
crops such as wheat and rice,

591
00:45:58 --> 00:46:03
for example, are very low in lysine.

592
00:46:03 --> 00:46:07
So if you just eat those you end up
with a lysine deficiency that's not

593
00:46:07 --> 00:46:12
good.  But, on the other hand,
beans, lentils, the various

594
00:46:12 --> 00:46:17
leguminous plants,
which also are those ones that form

595
00:46:17 --> 00:46:21
the special associations with
bacteria that let them convert

596
00:46:21 --> 00:46:26
atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia,
legumes are high in lysine but low

597
00:46:26 --> 00:46:31
in methionine.
So peoples all over the world

598
00:46:31 --> 00:46:36
figured this out by trial and error.
So the Mexican diet is rice and

599
00:46:36 --> 00:46:41
beans.  There's a reason for it.
What's happening actually is just

600
00:46:41 --> 00:46:46
in the rice you're low in lysine,
but by having beans at the same time

601
00:46:46 --> 00:46:51
you're balancing out the two.
Or the Native Americans in this pat

602
00:46:51 --> 00:46:56
of the country had the three
sisters with the corn, the

603
00:46:56 --> 00:47:01
squash and the beans.
And again they were balancing out

604
00:47:01 --> 00:47:05
the diet by making sure that they
got the various amino acids,

605
00:47:05 --> 00:47:09
a balance of all the amino acids
that were necessary for life.

606
00:47:09 --> 00:47:13
It also actually was really good
gardening practice because the beans

607
00:47:13 --> 00:47:17
were able to convert atmospheric
nitrogen into ammonia,

608
00:47:17 --> 00:47:21
which was fertilizer, and the squash
leaves shaded the ground so that the

609
00:47:21 --> 00:47:25
ground didn't dry out,
and the corn could grow even when it

610
00:47:25 --> 00:47:30
was short on water.
But what was really happening,

611
00:47:30 --> 00:47:34
as people grew without even
understanding about chemistry,

612
00:47:34 --> 00:47:39
they were compensating for the fact
that we're heterotrophs and needed

613
00:47:39 --> 00:47:43
to do this.  So we'll start in the
next lecture on trying to talk about

614
00:47:43 --> 00:47:48
how cells make energy and how it
makes some of this amazing

615
00:47:48 --> 00:47:51
stuff happen.
