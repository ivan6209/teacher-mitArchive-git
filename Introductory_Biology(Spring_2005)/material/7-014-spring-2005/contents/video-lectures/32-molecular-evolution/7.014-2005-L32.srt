1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
So what I want to do today is recap
a little bit what we talked about

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:08
last time, reiterate some of the
important points,

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:13
and then show you how we can learn
something about microorganisms in

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:17
the environment by talking about
in-situ identification of

5
00:00:17 --> 00:00:21
microorganisms as well as genomics.
We'll first talk about genomics and

6
00:00:21 --> 00:00:26
general and then talk about some
applications of genomics to

7
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
environmental microbiology because I
think there is some of the most

8
00:00:30 --> 00:00:35
exciting new developments are in the
area, actually.

9
00:00:35 --> 00:00:44
So last time we talked about
molecular evolution and ecology.

10
00:00:44 --> 00:00:53
And just to recap, some of the main
points were that we can actually use

11
00:00:53 --> 00:01:02
genes or gene sequences for a couple
of very important questions that we

12
00:01:02 --> 00:01:15
want to explore.
The first one was gene sequences act

13
00:01:15 --> 00:01:33
as evolutionary chronometers.

14
00:01:33 --> 00:01:40
Now, what do I mean by that?
Basically what we said last time

15
00:01:40 --> 00:01:48
was that each gene,
each sequence in the genome

16
00:01:48 --> 00:01:55
accumulates mutations with a certain
probability.  So what we mean is

17
00:01:55 --> 00:02:03
that all genes accumulate
mutations over time.

18
00:02:03 --> 00:02:07
Now, these of course are the
mutations that do not kill the

19
00:02:07 --> 00:02:12
organisms, so not the deleterious
mutations, but these are mutations

20
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
that are either slightly deleterious,
or don't matter,

21
00:02:16 --> 00:02:21
or are beneficial mutations.
OK, and what this entails is that

22
00:02:21 --> 00:02:25
each gene accumulates mutation with
a certain probability over time.

23
00:02:25 --> 00:02:30
It basically means that two
organisms that come from species

24
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
that are relatively closely related
to each other have gene sequences

25
00:02:34 --> 00:02:39
that will be much more similar to
each other than genes from an

26
00:02:39 --> 00:02:44
organism that comes from a species
that's much more distantly related.

27
00:02:44 --> 00:02:48
So, in practical terms what this
means is your genes are much,

28
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
much more similar to those of a
monkey than they are to a crocodile,

29
00:02:52 --> 00:02:56
for example.  And we can take
advantage of that by applying some

30
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
algorithms, some mathematical
modeling essentially,

31
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
to constrain these relationships in
those phylogenetic trees that we

32
00:03:04 --> 00:03:09
talked about last time.
And I also mentioned that the

33
00:03:09 --> 00:03:14
ribosomal RNA genes are particularly
important for that process.

34
00:03:14 --> 00:03:19
In principle, you could do it with
any protein coding machine or any

35
00:03:19 --> 00:03:24
kind of gene in the genome,
but we use the ribosomal RNA genes

36
00:03:24 --> 00:03:29
in particular because all organisms
have them.  They're part of a

37
00:03:29 --> 00:03:34
handful of genes that are what we
called universally distributed

38
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
last time.
And what this allows us to do is

39
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
then construct phylogenetic
relationships for all living

40
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
organisms.  And I just want to
remind you of the tree of life that

41
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
I showed you last time where we can
really explore the relationships

42
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
amongst all living organisms.
And some of the important points

43
00:03:54 --> 00:03:58
there that we made were,
for example, that the tree of life

44
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
supports the endosymbiont theory,
that when you actually look on the

45
00:04:02 --> 00:04:06
tree where the mitochondria and the
chloroplasts tree, they fall

46
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
into the bacteria.
Now, there is a question where

47
00:04:10 --> 00:04:15
somebody asked in the online survey,
can the mitochondria and

48
00:04:15 --> 00:04:21
chloroplasts still live outside of
the eukaryotic cell?

49
00:04:21 --> 00:04:26
And the answer is no,
they can't anymore because over

50
00:04:26 --> 00:04:31
evolutionary time the two organisms
have become so integrated that the

51
00:04:31 --> 00:04:37
mitochondria and chloroplasts both
lost their ability to live outside

52
00:04:37 --> 00:04:42
of the eukaryotic host cell.
Another important point that we made

53
00:04:42 --> 00:04:46
last time that I want to reiterate
here is that gene sequences,

54
00:04:46 --> 00:04:51
when we go into the environment,
and obtain them directly from the

55
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
environment act as a proxy for
microbial diversity in

56
00:04:55 --> 00:05:08
the environment.
So, the number of genes recovered

57
00:05:08 --> 00:05:30
directly from the environment is a
measure of diversity.

58
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
And we said that this actually plays
a very, very important role in the

59
00:05:34 --> 00:05:39
analysis of microbial communities,
and I showed you the example here

60
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
where we went and took some ocean
water and basically apply this

61
00:05:43 --> 00:05:48
technique that outlined last time
where we can actually amplify

62
00:05:48 --> 00:05:53
ribosomal RNA genes from
environmental samples,

63
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
clone them, determine the sequence,
and then constructs phylogenetic

64
00:05:57 --> 00:06:01
trees.
And what you see here is a tree

65
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
where we summarize the major groups
that we found in the sample have

66
00:06:05 --> 00:06:09
been only for two of those groups
where we show the entire set of

67
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
sequences that we actually obtained
because there were so many of them

68
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
out there.  And what we basically
found was that over 1500 bacterial

69
00:06:16 --> 00:06:20
16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences
coexist in this environment.

70
00:06:20 --> 00:06:24
And what we said also last time was
that the analyses like these have

71
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
really taught us that microorganisms
are the most diverse organisms

72
00:06:28 --> 00:06:32
on the planet.
So, most diversity is amongst the

73
00:06:32 --> 00:06:36
microorganisms,
and one of the big questions now is

74
00:06:36 --> 00:06:40
what are all those microorganisms
doing in the environment?

75
00:06:40 --> 00:06:44
And so, today what I want to do
with you is basically explore this

76
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
question of how we can actually
figure out what those microorganisms

77
00:06:48 --> 00:06:52
are all doing in environmental
samples?

78
00:06:52 --> 00:07:09
So we can say we are exploring the

79
00:07:09 --> 00:07:21
function of microbes in the
environment.  At first,

80
00:07:21 --> 00:07:33
I want to cover how we can actually
identify them in the environment.

81
00:07:33 --> 00:07:38
And I want to show you one specific
example, and then I want to talk

82
00:07:38 --> 00:07:44
about genomics in general,
and then basically end with an

83
00:07:44 --> 00:07:50
application of genomics to
environmental questions.

84
00:07:50 --> 00:07:56
So, let's first talk about the
in-situ identification

85
00:07:56 --> 00:08:14
of microorganisms.

86
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
And the basic problem that I alluded
to already before is that most

87
00:08:18 --> 00:08:23
microbes are only known
[SOUND OFF/THEN ON]

88
00:08:23 --> 00:08:33
-- from 16S ribosomal

89
00:08:33 --> 00:08:48
RNA clone libraries.

90
00:08:48 --> 00:09:03
And we basically want to search and
identify them in the environment.

91
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
OK, and I'll show you a specific
example of that later on.

92
00:09:07 --> 00:09:12
Now last time, we said that the
ribosomal RNA sequences consist

93
00:09:12 --> 00:09:17
really, like all gene sequences,
in fact.  We identified several

94
00:09:17 --> 00:09:22
stretches of nucleotides,
types of stretches, that can be

95
00:09:22 --> 00:09:26
found.  We said the A type stretches
and B type stretches that are very

96
00:09:26 --> 00:09:31
important for construction of
phylogenetic relationships,

97
00:09:31 --> 00:09:36
because we can align them and look
for changes in the nucleotide

98
00:09:36 --> 00:09:41
sequences because they are the same
length and only differ in mutation

99
00:09:41 --> 00:09:46
and single nucleotide
base pair changes.

100
00:09:46 --> 00:09:50
But then there's also those C type
stretches, if you remember,

101
00:09:50 --> 00:09:55
and those we said vary at much
faster rates because they are not

102
00:09:55 --> 00:10:00
functionally constrained
in those genes.

103
00:10:00 --> 00:10:08
OK, so they can actually also
accumulate length changes.

104
00:10:08 --> 00:10:17
And, it's these C type stretches
that we can use sort of as

105
00:10:17 --> 00:10:25
diagnostic sequence stretches for
microorganisms.

106
00:10:25 --> 00:10:34
So, what we can say is we identify
organisms by the C type stretches,

107
00:10:34 --> 00:10:47
C type sequence stretches.
And we call those signature

108
00:10:47 --> 00:11:03
sequences.  OK,
and they allow the differentiation

109
00:11:03 --> 00:11:16
of closely related organisms,
-- because they vary at very fast

110
00:11:16 --> 00:11:24
rates between organisms.
And the way we do this is that we

111
00:11:24 --> 00:11:32
construct so-called phylogenetic
probes.  I should probably

112
00:11:32 --> 00:11:38
write this over here.
Now what are those phylogenetic

113
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
probes?  They're basically short
pieces of DNA that have a

114
00:11:42 --> 00:11:46
fluorescent molecule
attached to them.

115
00:11:46 --> 00:12:03
-- DNA molecules that are roughly 20

116
00:12:03 --> 00:12:11
nucleotides in length,
and they carry a florescent molecule.

117
00:12:11 --> 00:12:19
Now what the short,
single-stranded stretches of DNA

118
00:12:19 --> 00:12:27
basically are is they are
complementary to those C type

119
00:12:27 --> 00:12:45
sequence stretches --

120
00:12:45 --> 00:12:52
-- in the ribosomal RNA.
And so basically what we can do is

121
00:12:52 --> 00:12:59
we can collect microbial cells from
the environment --

122
00:12:59 --> 00:13:17
-- make them permeable --

123
00:13:17 --> 00:13:33
-- and then basically mix them with

124
00:13:33 --> 00:13:48
those phylogenetic probes.

125
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
And these probes will then permeate
into the cell and bind to their

126
00:13:52 --> 00:14:15
complementary sequences.

127
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
Then we wash away the
unbound probe --

128
00:14:17 --> 00:14:33
-- and we can view it in a

129
00:14:33 --> 00:14:53
microscope under UV light.

130
00:14:53 --> 00:14:57
Let me show you an example of this.
What you see here is basically a

131
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
light micrograph.
So this is what you see basically

132
00:15:01 --> 00:15:06
when you collect microbial cells
from the environment under the

133
00:15:06 --> 00:15:10
microscope.  Most bacteria look the
same, so you cannot actually

134
00:15:10 --> 00:15:15
differentiate them all by just
looking at them.

135
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
But then these cells were fixed and
permeabilized and then basically

136
00:15:19 --> 00:15:24
mixed with two different
phylogenetic probes that identified

137
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
two different types of organisms.
One was labeled with a red Fluor,

138
00:15:28 --> 00:15:33
the other one with a green Fluor.

139
00:15:33 --> 00:15:42
And what you see is that you can now
differentiate those two organisms.

140
00:15:42 --> 00:15:52
Now, why is this especially
interesting?  Well here's just a

141
00:15:52 --> 00:16:02
specific example where people were
looking for bacteria capable of

142
00:16:02 --> 00:16:12
nitrogen oxidation.
These are bacteria that are very

143
00:16:12 --> 00:16:22
important in, for example,
sewage treatment.  And it was known

144
00:16:22 --> 00:16:32
that there were two different types
out there, one that oxidizes

145
00:16:32 --> 00:16:41
ammonia to nitrite,
-- and that a second one that

146
00:16:41 --> 00:16:47
oxidizes nitrite to nitrate.
And by doing this type of analysis

147
00:16:47 --> 00:16:53
what people basically learned is
that those two organisms live in

148
00:16:53 --> 00:17:00
very, very close proximity
at all times.

149
00:17:00 --> 00:17:04
So the organisms that oxidized
ammonia to nitrite are really

150
00:17:04 --> 00:17:08
attached, and oftentimes even
surround by the organisms that take

151
00:17:08 --> 00:17:12
the nitrite to nitrate.
So, where you have is a very close

152
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
cooperation between two different
types of microorganisms,

153
00:17:16 --> 00:17:21
and the transfer of one of the
substrates that's a product of the

154
00:17:21 --> 00:17:25
metabolism of one of the organisms
to another one: so extremely

155
00:17:25 --> 00:17:29
efficient process that really is
very important to take into

156
00:17:29 --> 00:17:33
consideration when you want to
understand processes like sewer

157
00:17:33 --> 00:17:37
treatment, but also nitrogen
biogeochemistry and

158
00:17:37 --> 00:17:45
the environment.
Any questions?

159
00:17:45 --> 00:17:55
OK, so for the remainder of the
lecture I want to talk

160
00:17:55 --> 00:18:03
about genomics,
-- and then in particular also its

161
00:18:03 --> 00:18:07
application to questions of
environmental microbiology and

162
00:18:07 --> 00:18:12
environmental science.
So first, what I want to do is give

163
00:18:12 --> 00:18:16
you a little bit of the definition
of genomics, and then cover how it

164
00:18:16 --> 00:18:21
is actually possible that we can
sequence entire genomes,

165
00:18:21 --> 00:18:25
and I want to give you some
highlights of what we have found by

166
00:18:25 --> 00:18:30
comparing different genomes
to each other.

167
00:18:30 --> 00:18:36
And then I want to talk about this
field about environmental genomics

168
00:18:36 --> 00:18:43
where we can use genomic techniques
to actually learn something about

169
00:18:43 --> 00:18:49
the function of different uncultured
microorganisms in the environment.

170
00:18:49 --> 00:18:56
So first, our definition, it's
basically to interpret

171
00:18:56 --> 00:19:03
or to sequence,
-- interpret, and compare whole

172
00:19:03 --> 00:19:11
genomes.  And as you will see the
comparison part actually plays an

173
00:19:11 --> 00:19:18
increasingly important role because
we have now actually genome

174
00:19:18 --> 00:19:26
sequences available from almost all,
or from at least some of the major

175
00:19:26 --> 00:19:32
groups of life.
So this, again,

176
00:19:32 --> 00:19:36
is a different kind of
representation of the tree of life.

177
00:19:36 --> 00:19:40
You have bacteria, archaea, and
eukarya again.

178
00:19:40 --> 00:19:44
And as you can see,
we have a lot of representatives.

179
00:19:44 --> 00:19:49
In fact, this doesn't even come
close to the diversity that we have

180
00:19:49 --> 00:19:53
now sequenced as well over a hundred
bacterial genome sequence now,

181
00:19:53 --> 00:19:57
several archeael genomes, and
increasingly also in

182
00:19:57 --> 00:20:02
eukaryotic genomes.
Now, genomes, so how is this done?

183
00:20:02 --> 00:20:08
How can we actually sequence
genomes?  Well,

184
00:20:08 --> 00:20:13
on the face of it we use very large
facilities where you have sequencing

185
00:20:13 --> 00:20:19
machines present.
There's one very important one at

186
00:20:19 --> 00:20:24
MIT, actually at the Broad Institute,
and here you see all those really

187
00:20:24 --> 00:20:30
industrial scale production
lines actually.

188
00:20:30 --> 00:20:40
But the basic problem is that
genomes are large.

189
00:20:40 --> 00:20:50
E. coli, for example,
has roughly 4.4 million base pairs,

190
00:20:50 --> 00:21:00
and the human genome is even much,
much larger.

191
00:21:00 --> 00:21:08
It has about 3 billion base pairs.
OK, so genomes are very, very large.

192
00:21:08 --> 00:21:22
But a single sequencing reaction--

193
00:21:22 --> 00:21:29
-- gives you only roughly 500-1,
00 nucleotides or base pairs.  So

194
00:21:29 --> 00:21:36
how is it that we can actually
sequence entire genomes?

195
00:21:36 --> 00:21:43
I'm going to walk you through this,
and there is some variation on the

196
00:21:43 --> 00:21:50
theme, but this is still a major
approach that's still used in some

197
00:21:50 --> 00:21:57
of the sequencing facilities.
Now, you start out by extracting

198
00:21:57 --> 00:22:04
genomic DNA from organisms,
and then you use restriction enzymes

199
00:22:04 --> 00:22:11
to cut the DNA into relatively large
pieces of DNA, so about 160

200
00:22:11 --> 00:22:17
kilobase pairs long.
On average, this is shown here.

201
00:22:17 --> 00:22:22
Kilo means a thousand, so 160,000
base pairs long.

202
00:22:22 --> 00:22:28
These pieces are then cloned into
specific cloning vectors that are

203
00:22:28 --> 00:22:43
called BAC vectors.

204
00:22:43 --> 00:23:01
So therefore, cloning large pieces
of DNA, and BAC stands for Bacterial

205
00:23:01 --> 00:23:17
Artificial Chromosome.
And what they basically are,

206
00:23:17 --> 00:23:31
are plasmids, very special plasmids
that can carry large pieces of

207
00:23:31 --> 00:23:40
genome, or large genome fragments.
So, by cloning into those BAC

208
00:23:40 --> 00:23:45
vectors, what you do is you
basically divide up the genome,

209
00:23:45 --> 00:23:50
and then the step number three is
mostly done for eukaryotic genomes

210
00:23:50 --> 00:23:55
because they are so much larger.
You can actually map and analyze

211
00:23:55 --> 00:24:00
the fragments,
and map them onto genome maps where

212
00:24:00 --> 00:24:05
you know the location of different
restriction fragments and different

213
00:24:05 --> 00:24:10
genes, actually.
For bacteria, this step is mostly

214
00:24:10 --> 00:24:15
skipped, actually.
What you do with each one of those

215
00:24:15 --> 00:24:20
BACs, is you cut them further up
into 1 kilobase per fragment,

216
00:24:20 --> 00:24:25
so much smaller fragments.  And
these are called,

217
00:24:25 --> 00:24:30
and these are cloned then into
normal plasmid vectors.

218
00:24:30 --> 00:24:35
And so you generate what are called
shotgun clones.

219
00:24:35 --> 00:24:40
So, these are then cloned into E.
coli, you go through the same type

220
00:24:40 --> 00:24:45
of steps that we discussed before
already with environmental clone

221
00:24:45 --> 00:24:50
libraries.  And you can actually
determine the sequence of each one

222
00:24:50 --> 00:24:55
of those pieces of DNA.
And what you will then get,

223
00:24:55 --> 00:25:00
is small fragments of overlapping
DNA sequences.

224
00:25:00 --> 00:25:04
That it shown here.
You'll find overlaps,

225
00:25:04 --> 00:25:09
basically, which piece together the
whole genome.  And so,

226
00:25:09 --> 00:25:14
first to assemble, you piece
together these genome fragments that

227
00:25:14 --> 00:25:19
are present in the BACs,
and then finally you piece together

228
00:25:19 --> 00:25:24
the entire genome propose large
sequence pieces,

229
00:25:24 --> 00:25:29
and you get a so-called draft genome
sequence.

230
00:25:29 --> 00:25:39
The next step in this analysis,
then, is that you do so-called

231
00:25:39 --> 00:25:49
genome annotation is.
And the first very important step

232
00:25:49 --> 00:26:00
is that you translate the gene
sequences into amino acids.

233
00:26:00 --> 00:26:05
So, the nucleotide sequences into
amino acids particularly in

234
00:26:05 --> 00:26:10
prokaryotes.  This step can
be done right away --

235
00:26:10 --> 00:26:31
-- and what this allows you to do,

236
00:26:31 --> 00:26:37
is you can look for what we call
open reading frames,

237
00:26:37 --> 00:26:44
or ORFs.  And what you look for is a
start codon and a stop codon that

238
00:26:44 --> 00:26:50
basically branches or frames a
stretch of amino acids encoded by

239
00:26:50 --> 00:26:57
the nucleotides. So
you look for ORFs.

240
00:26:57 --> 00:27:13
And these are your putative genes.

241
00:27:13 --> 00:27:26
The next step that you can do,

242
00:27:26 --> 00:27:32
then, is you can go to databases and
now you compare your ORFs to

243
00:27:32 --> 00:27:39
information that is present in the
databases.  So basically,

244
00:27:39 --> 00:27:45
you inquire the database and ask,
is a gene sequence that is similar

245
00:27:45 --> 00:27:52
to the one that I have statistically
significantly similar present that

246
00:27:52 --> 00:27:58
allows me to say something about the
function of this particular gene?

247
00:27:58 --> 00:28:05
So function, can then be identified
by comparison with databases.

248
00:28:05 --> 00:28:29
Any questions?

249
00:28:29 --> 00:28:34
OK, so that allows you,
then, to basically say something

250
00:28:34 --> 00:28:39
about the different genes that you
have found in the genome,

251
00:28:39 --> 00:28:44
but to give you an impression of how
new this field really is and how

252
00:28:44 --> 00:28:49
little we still know about the
diversity of genes and organisms,

253
00:28:49 --> 00:28:54
on average when we sequence a new
bacterial genome we find about 30%

254
00:28:54 --> 00:28:59
of the genes, or a third of the
genes have no known functional

255
00:28:59 --> 00:29:05
analog of the databases.
OK, so there's a lot to learn about

256
00:29:05 --> 00:29:11
the diversity of life and about the
functional diversity of life.

257
00:29:11 --> 00:29:18
In eukaryotes, there are some
little twists,

258
00:29:18 --> 00:29:24
as you all know.
And basically, that is that genes

259
00:29:24 --> 00:29:31
of course consist of introns
and exons, right?

260
00:29:31 --> 00:29:35
And so it's basically relatively
difficult to directly identify those

261
00:29:35 --> 00:29:40
open reading frames.
And what you have to do is that you

262
00:29:40 --> 00:29:45
have to actually oftentimes,
so let's write this down.

263
00:29:45 --> 00:30:01
And what people oftentimes do,

264
00:30:01 --> 00:30:12
then, is that they search for
matching sequences in so-called cDNA

265
00:30:12 --> 00:30:24
libraries.  Now what are cDNA
libraries?  Let me just show you

266
00:30:24 --> 00:30:32
this on the next slide.  Skip this.
Basically what you can do is you can

267
00:30:32 --> 00:30:38
isolate messenger RNA from cells and
that translate the messenger RNA by

268
00:30:38 --> 00:30:43
a process called reverse
transcription that the viral enzyme

269
00:30:43 --> 00:30:49
that translates RNA into DNA,
so you can translate it into DNA

270
00:30:49 --> 00:30:54
fragments.  And you can then clone
those DNA fragments into plasmids,

271
00:30:54 --> 00:31:00
sequence those, and then basically
see what are the pieces that are

272
00:31:00 --> 00:31:06
actually, what are the
introns in the genes?

273
00:31:06 --> 00:31:11
What are the pieces that are excised
when the messenger RNA is actually

274
00:31:11 --> 00:31:29
created from the genome?

275
00:31:29 --> 00:31:33
And so, let me just cover now a few
of the major insights that people

276
00:31:33 --> 00:31:37
have come up with.
Of course, it's a very growing

277
00:31:37 --> 00:31:41
field and a lot of excitement
is coming out.

278
00:31:41 --> 00:31:58
And I first want to talk about

279
00:31:58 --> 00:32:09
bacteria and archaea --

280
00:32:09 --> 00:32:13
-- and then say a few words also
about eukaryotes or eukaryote.

281
00:32:13 --> 00:32:17
First of all, what we learned about,
bacteria and archaea,

282
00:32:17 --> 00:32:21
is that their genomes are very
compact.

283
00:32:21 --> 00:32:35
Whenever they have pieces of DNA

284
00:32:35 --> 00:32:43
that are not frequently used,
they're actually lost from the

285
00:32:43 --> 00:32:51
genome.  OK, so they lose genes,
I should say, relatively easily, and

286
00:32:51 --> 00:32:59
we can see this that the genome size
is correlated to metabolic

287
00:32:59 --> 00:33:12
diversity.

288
00:33:12 --> 00:33:23
So, for example,
we have Mycoplasma genetalium and

289
00:33:23 --> 00:33:37
Streptomyces --

290
00:33:37 --> 00:33:42
coelicor are two very different
bacteria.  The first one is an

291
00:33:42 --> 00:34:01
obligate intracellular parasite.

292
00:34:01 --> 00:34:08
OK, so, which means it's actually
bathed in a nutrient solution in the

293
00:34:08 --> 00:34:16
eukaryotic cells that it invades.
It doesn't have to make amino acids.

294
00:34:16 --> 00:34:23
It gets it just from the host cell.
And it turns out it has a very

295
00:34:23 --> 00:34:31
small genome, so only 0.
8-based mega-base pairs, so 580,

296
00:34:31 --> 00:34:37
00 base pairs, and only 517 genes.
And interestingly,

297
00:34:37 --> 00:34:41
actually people are now using this
organism to try and ask,

298
00:34:41 --> 00:34:46
well, what's the minimum number of
genes that organism can actually

299
00:34:46 --> 00:34:50
will live with?
And so, they are deleting in a

300
00:34:50 --> 00:34:55
stepwise fashion the different genes
in this organism,

301
00:34:55 --> 00:34:59
and it turns out that you need about
two to 300 genes minimum in order to

302
00:34:59 --> 00:35:03
make the things survive.
On the other hand,

303
00:35:03 --> 00:35:15
streptomyces is a soil bacterium --

304
00:35:15 --> 00:35:20
-- has a very complex lifestyle,
can degrade a lot of environmental

305
00:35:20 --> 00:35:26
substrates, and it has a very big
genome, one of the biggest bacterial

306
00:35:26 --> 00:35:31
genomes.  And so,
those two organisms basically span

307
00:35:31 --> 00:35:37
pretty much the range of
bacterial genome sizes.

308
00:35:37 --> 00:35:41
And so, it's thought that it has
about 7,846 genes.

309
00:35:41 --> 00:35:57
Now, we also have a very large

310
00:35:57 --> 00:36:09
genetic diversity --

311
00:36:09 --> 00:36:23
-- between species.
And typically what you find is that

312
00:36:23 --> 00:36:38
roughly 15 to 30% of genes are
unique to a specific species.

313
00:36:38 --> 00:36:44
And that's really because bacteria
and archaea have the capability to

314
00:36:44 --> 00:36:50
affect a lot of chemical reactions
that eukaryotes,

315
00:36:50 --> 00:36:56
for example, cannot.
There's about 20 million known

316
00:36:56 --> 00:37:02
organic substances,
organic chemicals, and almost all of

317
00:37:02 --> 00:37:07
them are biodegradable by bacteria.
Even the minutest compounds if it

318
00:37:07 --> 00:37:12
were not biodegradable bacteria,
would build up in the environment,

319
00:37:12 --> 00:37:16
OK?  So, if it just where a cofactor
that some organism produces because

320
00:37:16 --> 00:37:21
we have such a long period of time
of evolution on this planet and

321
00:37:21 --> 00:37:26
evolutionary history,
you probably would be able to dig it

322
00:37:26 --> 00:37:32
up in your backyard.
One of the other very important and

323
00:37:32 --> 00:37:39
interesting insights that has come
out with comparing genomes for

324
00:37:39 --> 00:37:46
microorganisms is that lateral gene
transfer is a very important process

325
00:37:46 --> 00:38:07
amongst microorganisms.

326
00:38:07 --> 00:38:11
Now what do I mean by lateral gene
transfer?  It basically means that

327
00:38:11 --> 00:38:16
we find evidence among bacterial
genomes that they have actually

328
00:38:16 --> 00:38:20
taken genes from completely
unrelated organisms.

329
00:38:20 --> 00:38:25
And I just want to show you one
example here from that of

330
00:38:25 --> 00:38:38
thermotoga maritima --

331
00:38:38 --> 00:38:47
-- which lives in hot springs.
This is a very interesting

332
00:38:47 --> 00:38:56
bacterium that lives in hot water of
around 80°C and thrives only in

333
00:38:56 --> 00:39:05
those kinds of environments.
And they coexist there with many

334
00:39:05 --> 00:39:14
archaea.  And when people sequenced
the genome of thermotoga maritima

335
00:39:14 --> 00:39:23
what they found was that about 25%
of the genes have their closest

336
00:39:23 --> 00:39:32
relatives in archaeal genomes.
So roughly 25% of genes in

337
00:39:32 --> 00:39:39
thermotoga are of archaeal origin.
And how can we actually figure

338
00:39:39 --> 00:39:44
something like that out?
Well, the most important technique

339
00:39:44 --> 00:39:49
is, again, phylogenetic tree
construction.  And so when you have,

340
00:39:49 --> 00:39:54
for example, gene A, well let me
draw this, actually,

341
00:39:54 --> 00:40:10
on a new board.

342
00:40:10 --> 00:40:15
So you're comparing,
say, three organisms,

343
00:40:15 --> 00:40:21
organism A, B, and C and you compare
gene one with gene two.

344
00:40:21 --> 00:40:27
And you notice that most genes
adhere to this pattern,

345
00:40:27 --> 00:40:33
but that every now and then there's
a gene that gives you this

346
00:40:33 --> 00:40:38
type of pattern.
What you can then conclude is that

347
00:40:38 --> 00:40:43
this gene, C, has not coevolved with
the other genes in the genome of

348
00:40:43 --> 00:40:48
these organisms but was actually
transferred into it from another

349
00:40:48 --> 00:40:53
source.  And I don't have time to go
actually into the mechanisms.

350
00:40:53 --> 00:40:58
If you're interested, I teach a
graduate class that undergraduates

351
00:40:58 --> 00:41:03
actually take in our department,
environmental microbiology, where we

352
00:41:03 --> 00:41:08
discussed a lot of the mechanisms.
It's basically a lot of viruses can

353
00:41:08 --> 00:41:13
affect gene transfer but also
plasmids and transposons.

354
00:41:13 --> 00:41:18
But for bacteria, again, you should
remember that often new function is

355
00:41:18 --> 00:41:23
actually oftentimes arises by
lateral gene transfer.

356
00:41:23 --> 00:41:28
And one of the interesting things
is that lateral gene transfer is

357
00:41:28 --> 00:41:34
actually very important in the
evolution of pathogenic bacteria.

358
00:41:34 --> 00:41:48
So, the so-called virulence genes,

359
00:41:48 --> 00:41:57
which are the genes that basically
affect pathogenesis.  Do

360
00:41:57 --> 00:42:13
you have a question?
Among pathogenic bacteria,

361
00:42:13 --> 00:42:35
often arise by lateral gene transfer.
OK.  Any questions?

362
00:42:35 --> 00:42:43
OK, now for eukarya,
I just want to make the point that

363
00:42:43 --> 00:42:52
their genomes are generally orders
of magnitudes larger --

364
00:42:52 --> 00:43:16
OK, and that the exons,

365
00:43:16 --> 00:43:23
so the stretches that really encode
the protein that make up the

366
00:43:23 --> 00:43:30
organism, the exons are only
typically a few percent

367
00:43:30 --> 00:43:37
of the genome.
That's particularly in higher

368
00:43:37 --> 00:43:44
eukaryotes.  Yeasts,
for example, have a much more

369
00:43:44 --> 00:43:50
compact genome also.
We, for example, are full of DNA

370
00:43:50 --> 00:43:57
that people still have a very hard
time figuring out what that actually

371
00:43:57 --> 00:44:04
does.  But it seems that the
majority of the genome,

372
00:44:04 --> 00:44:10
so-called repeated sequences --
-- many of which seems to be ancient

373
00:44:10 --> 00:44:15
retroviruses that have inserted
themselves into the genome and have

374
00:44:15 --> 00:44:21
since then lost actually their
function.  OK,

375
00:44:21 --> 00:44:26
so the remaining time I want to just
give you an example of how we can

376
00:44:26 --> 00:44:31
now use these techniques that I
outlined before to learn something

377
00:44:31 --> 00:44:37
about microorganisms
in the environment.

378
00:44:37 --> 00:44:47
It's called environmental.

379
00:44:47 --> 00:45:04
Basically, the way this all started

380
00:45:04 --> 00:45:08
was by going into the environment
and extracting nuclear gases and

381
00:45:08 --> 00:45:13
treating them exactly the same way
as if you had a single genome.

382
00:45:13 --> 00:45:18
But, again, remember, we have a
very large mixture of microorganisms

383
00:45:18 --> 00:45:22
present in the environment.
And where this is mostly done was

384
00:45:22 --> 00:45:27
in the ocean, actually.
And what people did, was they

385
00:45:27 --> 00:45:32
constructed those BAC clones
directly from the environment and

386
00:45:32 --> 00:45:36
then looked amongst those BAC clones
for specific 16S ribosomal

387
00:45:36 --> 00:45:41
RNA genes.
Remember, this is the marker that we

388
00:45:41 --> 00:45:45
have for microorganisms in the
environment.  We know the diversity

389
00:45:45 --> 00:45:49
of microorganisms through those
types of genes,

390
00:45:49 --> 00:45:53
and we have a lot of the data
available.  And so,

391
00:45:53 --> 00:45:57
in order to link a specific function
of such an organism that we only

392
00:45:57 --> 00:46:01
know from the 16S ribosomal
RNA genes.

393
00:46:01 --> 00:46:06
So, to ask the question of what much
of this organism might be carrying

394
00:46:06 --> 00:46:12
out in the environment,
it's very useful to sequence BAC

395
00:46:12 --> 00:46:17
clones that have 16S ribosomal RNA
genes on them,

396
00:46:17 --> 00:46:23
and determine what kinds of protein
coding genes are on there that might

397
00:46:23 --> 00:46:28
reveal some of the function of the
organism in the environment.

398
00:46:28 --> 00:46:34
And one example that I want to show
you is that of the proteorhodopsin.

399
00:46:34 --> 00:46:45
So basically, the initial task was
to sequence BAC clones containing

400
00:46:45 --> 00:46:57
ribosomal RNA genes,
and look for other genes that might

401
00:46:57 --> 00:47:15
reveal some of the function.

402
00:47:15 --> 00:47:18
So, you don't want to look for all
the genes that encode proteins that

403
00:47:18 --> 00:47:22
are important to the cell cycle and
things like that,

404
00:47:22 --> 00:47:25
but really sort of metabolic genes
that might tell you something about

405
00:47:25 --> 00:47:29
the type of metabolism that this
organism carries out

406
00:47:29 --> 00:47:33
in the environment.
And so, what the first example that

407
00:47:33 --> 00:47:39
turned out to be really,
really important is that people

408
00:47:39 --> 00:47:44
found rhodopsin genes on one of
those BAC fragments,

409
00:47:44 --> 00:47:50
and it turns out this rhodopsin
catalyzes or these rhodopsin genes

410
00:47:50 --> 00:47:55
produce a protein that inserts
itself into the bacterial membrane,

411
00:47:55 --> 00:48:01
and it's a photoreceptor that when
it's hit by light,

412
00:48:01 --> 00:48:06
it actually becomes a proton pump.
So, it expels protons from the cell

413
00:48:06 --> 00:48:11
interior to the outside,
and you already know that this is

414
00:48:11 --> 00:48:16
important in energy generation in
all living cells.

415
00:48:16 --> 00:48:20
So proton gradient across membranes
basically give the cells sort of a

416
00:48:20 --> 00:48:25
battery status that can be exploited
by ATPase molecules or ATPase

417
00:48:25 --> 00:48:30
proteins that equalize the proton
gradient and affect ATP

418
00:48:30 --> 00:48:35
synthesis in doing so.
Now, why is this so important?

419
00:48:35 --> 00:48:40
Well, it turned out that this type
of protein is present in almost all

420
00:48:40 --> 00:48:45
microbial cells that were previously
thought to be heterotrophs alone in

421
00:48:45 --> 00:48:49
the ocean in the parts of the ocean
that receive enough life.

422
00:48:49 --> 00:48:54
And what this means is that our
estimates of the global carbon

423
00:48:54 --> 00:48:59
budget of the ocean were basically
wrong because most microorganisms in

424
00:48:59 --> 00:49:12
the ocean have this.

425
00:49:12 --> 00:49:31
So most prokaryotes in the ocean
have a light-driven proton pump

426
00:49:31 --> 00:49:52
which is called proteorhodopsin.
And it basically allows them to gain

427
00:49:52 --> 00:50:06
energy from sunlight.
And there's an increasing number of

428
00:50:06 --> 00:50:12
such examples now where we are
learning to interpret environmental

429
00:50:12 --> 00:50:18
communities, and the function of
environmental microbial communities

430
00:50:18 --> 00:50:23
through those genomic approaches.
And it reveals basically an

431
00:50:23 --> 00:50:29
enormous diversity of organisms out
there.  And what we also are

432
00:50:29 --> 00:50:35
learning to do now is to assemble
entire genomes from those samples by

433
00:50:35 --> 00:50:40
applying genomic techniques.
And this is an example here where

434
00:50:40 --> 00:50:44
you see, this was published last
year, where people went out and

435
00:50:44 --> 00:50:49
basically were able to piece
together from pieces of genes

436
00:50:49 --> 00:50:53
obtained from the environment,
entire genomes or fragments of

437
00:50:53 --> 00:50:58
entire genomes.
And that's shown here.

438
00:50:58 --> 00:51:02
Those are contiguous sequences.
OK, so if you have any questions

439
00:51:02 --> 00:51:07
let me know by e-mail,
or if you're interested in pursuing

440
00:51:07 --> 00:51:11
this further I also teach another
class in civil and environmental

441
00:51:11 --> 00:51:14
engineering.
