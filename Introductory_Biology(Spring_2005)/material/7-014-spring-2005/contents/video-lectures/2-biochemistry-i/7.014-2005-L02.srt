1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:03
Today we're going to start get into
at least the nitty-gritty stuff of

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:07
the course.  I think a point I want
to, just to give you a very broad

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
perspective apart from why biology
is interesting,

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:14
I want to talk about just very
briefly how we study biology.

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:17
I sort of talked about it the other
day by sort of the levels at which

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:21
we could do it,
from the biosphere all the way down

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
to the molecular level.
But there is another way of looking

8
00:00:24 --> 00:00:28
at it.  And I just want to remind
you of what I said the other day.

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
Biology is an experimental
science

10
00:00:32 --> 00:00:38
What we know or think we know at the

11
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
moment is because of people having
made observations,

12
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
designed hypotheses,
tested them and so on.

13
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
And what you're seeing is sort of
the sum of the current state of

14
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
human knowledge when I'm talking to
you right now.

15
00:00:52 --> 00:00:56
There are various,
two sort of major disciplines that

16
00:00:56 --> 00:01:00
have been used to get at how
biological function works.

17
00:01:00 --> 00:01:04
As you'll see,
the main actor for many of the

18
00:01:04 --> 00:01:08
things that happened inside of cells
and in living organisms are proteins.

19
00:01:08 --> 00:01:12
And we'll be talking about what
those are and their structures in

20
00:01:12 --> 00:01:16
some detail at the next thing.
But the information is not coded in

21
00:01:16 --> 00:01:20
the proteins.  The information for
coding everything that's in a cell

22
00:01:20 --> 00:01:24
is in units called genes which are
made of, as you probably

23
00:01:24 --> 00:01:27
all know, DNA.
So there have been,

24
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
classically there were two
approaches towards studying biology

25
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
in detailed ways.
One was the approach of the

26
00:01:34 --> 00:01:38
biochemist who basically took
whatever it was,

27
00:01:38 --> 00:01:42
put it in a whirling blender or
something, and ripped everything

28
00:01:42 --> 00:01:45
into little pieces.
Sort of like taking the alarm clock

29
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
and shaking it so hard all you've
got is all the little bits.

30
00:01:49 --> 00:01:52
And once you got it into all little
bits then you can purify a little

31
00:01:52 --> 00:01:56
thing like a spring or a little
wheel or something and try then to

32
00:01:56 --> 00:02:00
figure out what that does in the
context of the cell.

33
00:02:00 --> 00:02:05
You can get very detailed
information.  And this is in a sort

34
00:02:05 --> 00:02:11
of trivial way the science of,
discipline of biochemistry.

35
00:02:11 --> 00:02:17
Geneticists take a different sort of
approach.  And what they do is they

36
00:02:17 --> 00:02:23
take the living organism and look
for a variant where there has just

37
00:02:23 --> 00:02:29
been one single change in that whole
organism and they study

38
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
its properties.
And what you learn from that is

39
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
physiologically relevant information.
And if you broke up a car and

40
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
purified the ashtray you could
postulate that that was really

41
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
important for the car.
But if you made a mutant that was

42
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
missing the ashtray and it still ran,
you know, you'd learn that that

43
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
wasn't what was correct.
And one of the really powerful

44
00:02:52 --> 00:02:56
things that people could only do in
very rare instances for a long time

45
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
was to unite the kinds of
observations that biochemists made

46
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
with the kinds of observations
geneticists made.

47
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
And the explosion in knowledge
that's happened over the last couple

48
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
of decades, probably,
well, since probably 1975 when

49
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
recombinant DNA came in,
was a whole new realm of sort of a

50
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
general discipline we call molecular
biology that allowed us to clone

51
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
genes, to sequence them,
to many of the things we'll be

52
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
talking about.
But one of the real powers in

53
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
looking at this sort of way of
thinking about how we study biology

54
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
is that it suddenly enabled one to
put these two sorts of things

55
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
together.  If you were a biochemist
and you purified a protein and you

56
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
found out a chemical property that
it had and you wondered what it did

57
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
in the cell, you could sequence the
protein and deduce what some of the

58
00:03:45 --> 00:03:49
DNA sequence was,
find the gene, disable the gene in

59
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
the organism, look and see if your
idea was right.

60
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
Or vice versa, if you were a
geneticist and you found a mutant

61
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
that had an interesting property and
you wondered how it was working then

62
00:03:59 --> 00:04:03
you could clone the gene,
look at the protein and try and

63
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
figure it out.
And that's partly way since about

64
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
1975 there has just been this
absolute upheaval in our knowledge

65
00:04:13 --> 00:04:18
of biology.  And we'll be talking
about all of these disciplines here

66
00:04:18 --> 00:04:24
as we go through the course.
Three or four of you were honest

67
00:04:24 --> 00:04:30
enough to say I'd rather be anywhere
on earth but in this class.

68
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
I'm a senior.  I really didn't want
to be here.  And I said to you the

69
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
other day if you'll come I'll give
you the best I have to try and show

70
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
you why I think it's exciting and
why it's so relevant to you and your

71
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
life as you go looking forward to
moving on with your careers and your

72
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
family and everything else.
However, even if you're not

73
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
interested in this course,
don't get caught in the trap because

74
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
we're not going to be doing
differential equations that it's

75
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
easy.  Part of the reason biology is
hard is each one of these

76
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
disciplines has a different
kind of thinking.

77
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
And to be very effective in biology
right now you have to be able to

78
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
think like a chemist,
how bonds are formed and broken and

79
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
what's reasonable.
You need to be able to think in

80
00:05:11 --> 00:05:15
3-dimensional structures because
everything happens in 3-D and

81
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
biology is very much about fitting
shapes together.

82
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
Genetics is more like probability
and statistics.

83
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
Some of those logic games that you
sort of used to try and do.

84
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
It's more like that.  PCR is,
I don't know, recombinant DNA, all

85
00:05:28 --> 00:05:32
this sort of stuff is sort of a
strategy kind of game.

86
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
So you'll find,
as you go through this course,

87
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
that there maybe some things that
are easy and some that are difficult.

88
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
But for you, easier or difficult,
you'll need to do a lot of different

89
00:05:41 --> 00:05:45
thinking.  And then,
at the moment, you cannot do biology

90
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
anymore by just being a biochemist
or just being a geneticist.

91
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
You could in the old days, but now
you've got to do it all.

92
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
So where we're going to start right
now will be with biochemistry.

93
00:05:54 --> 00:05:58
And just before I do that I just
want to show you --

94
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
Let's see.  I wonder if we're going
to be able to see these slides with

95
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
that light on.
I think we'll see if we can do this.

96
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
So the green fluorescent protein,
thanks, that's great.  The green

97
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
fluorescent protein,
which we showed you the other day,

98
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
is a protein.  And we're going to be
talking about that.

99
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
And you'll see it's got structures.
You've got these sorts of sheets

100
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
and you'll see little helices.
And in a couple of days you'll know

101
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
what this is all about.
But I wanted to tell you a couple

102
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
of things just before
I get into this.

103
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
This actually was,
I showed you that little Barney

104
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
thing to try to emphasize that if
you looked at evolution that way,

105
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
you can see most of it was at the
level of single cells,

106
00:06:38 --> 00:06:42
and that's why things are so common
when you get down to the cellular

107
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
and molecular level.
I've actually done that demo one

108
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
other place, and that was after,
I'm an American Cancer Society

109
00:06:50 --> 00:06:54
research professor,
and they asked me to give a talk for

110
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
the 50th anniversary of the Illinois
Division of the American Cancer

111
00:06:58 --> 00:07:03
Society of the importance
of basic research.

112
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
And it was after dinner,
500 people in tuxedos and evening

113
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
gowns and bottles of wine,
and they kept shortening my time.

114
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
And finally I had ten minutes to
get up there in my tux and tell them

115
00:07:12 --> 00:07:16
about the importance of research,
basic research.  And I finally

116
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
decided maybe what I could do is
help them understand why when they

117
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
gave money to cure cancer biologists
went, ah, signed this one off,

118
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
and studied all these other
organisms, fruit flies and

119
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
everything.  So I did this little
demo.  So I was up on the stage at

120
00:07:29 --> 00:07:32
the Sheraton holding the Barney and
the dinosaur doing what

121
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
you saw me do here.
And I thought of briefly about

122
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
putting my tux on just to kind of,
you know, give a little zip to the

123
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
extra lecture,
but decided not to because I'd get

124
00:07:41 --> 00:07:45
chalk all over it or something.
So if you think I look stupid doing

125
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
this, you know,
my cats thought I was absolutely an

126
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
idiot afterwards.
They looked very,

127
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
very puzzled as to what was going on.
OK.  So I'm going to start talking

128
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
in a couple of minutes about
covalent bonds,

129
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
and you're going to roll your eyes
upwards and think I've heard about

130
00:08:00 --> 00:08:04
that since I was a baby,
or some of you will think that.

131
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
But I just want to keep,
you've got to understand something

132
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
about how the parts that are used in
biology are built or it won't make

133
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
sense.  And so just to sort of give
you something to sort of keep you

134
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
going here, I want to sort of
foreshadow a couple of things that

135
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
are coming.  Here's an example of
what happens with genetics.

136
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
This is a single mutation in one
gene of an individual.

137
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
This woman has what's known as
Werner syndrome.

138
00:08:26 --> 00:08:30
That's what she looked like as a
teenager.

139
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
That's what she looked like at age
48.  That's one of these mutations

140
00:08:33 --> 00:08:37
that causes advanced aging.
And people are working very hard on

141
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
what that, you know,
trying to understand aging.

142
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
During your time at MIT, there are
going to be some,

143
00:08:44 --> 00:08:47
there already have been some amazing
discoveries in the last five years,

144
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
and it's going to be a time of
explosive growth.

145
00:08:51 --> 00:08:55
But that's just one change.
And it offers a huge clue as to why

146
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
we age.  Here's another example.
These are people who have a human

147
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
condition called Xeroderma
Pigmentosum.  And this was the way

148
00:09:02 --> 00:09:06
they used to look before we
understood it.

149
00:09:06 --> 00:09:10
They have a deficiency in handling
damage to their DNA that's caused by

150
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
sunlight.  So if they went out in
the sunlight once they'd get skin

151
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
cancer.  You can see they get skin
lesions and everything else.

152
00:09:17 --> 00:09:21
It was due to a defect in just one
gene.  And it took out an important

153
00:09:21 --> 00:09:25
kind of DNA repair.
Now they know how it works.

154
00:09:25 --> 00:09:29
The kids who do this only go out at
night.

155
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
They go to summer camp at night.
They call them “Children of the

156
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
Moon”.  They look normal and they
don't get skin cancer,

157
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
but they have to live a kind of
special life because of this problem.

158
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
And people are working on fixing
that.  That's the sort of thing that

159
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
can come out genetics.
Single change, absolutely dramatic

160
00:09:44 --> 00:09:47
affect.  You can sort of make
inferences that something important

161
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
is broken in that individual because
the rest of us don't have this

162
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
problem.  The biochemists,
you know Watson and Crick, and we'll

163
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
talk more about their structure of
DNA.  But DNA has to

164
00:09:56 --> 00:10:00
get replicated.
In fact, just in the last couple

165
00:10:00 --> 00:10:04
years we now know that's what's
wrong with this person is that

166
00:10:04 --> 00:10:09
they're lacking a special DNA
copying machine that is able to copy

167
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
over strands of DNA that have damage
in them that's caused by sunlight.

168
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
It's got a very sort of flexible
active site.  It can accommodate the

169
00:10:17 --> 00:10:22
bulkiness of this UV induced lesion.
And so here's a case where we've

170
00:10:22 --> 00:10:26
now united our understanding of that
disease at the ultimate biochemical

171
00:10:26 --> 00:10:31
molecular level and the high level
human syndrome.

172
00:10:31 --> 00:10:35
So that's kind of one thing to sort
of keep you going.

173
00:10:35 --> 00:10:39
OK.  So here's a cell.
That's the fundamental unit of life.

174
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
I said the other day member cells
carry out metabolism.

175
00:10:43 --> 00:10:48
They do regulated growth.
They do reproduction.  That's what

176
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52
makes them different from just a bag
of proteins and nucleic acids and

177
00:10:52 --> 00:10:56
things.  And we could think about
cells at a couple of

178
00:10:56 --> 00:11:01
different levels.
We could think about them in terms

179
00:11:01 --> 00:11:06
of their atomic composition.
I guess we can.  Let's see.  And if

180
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
we think about it that way it's not
particularly exciting.

181
00:11:12 --> 00:11:17
Hydrogen is about 60%,
oxygen is about 20%, carbon is about

182
00:11:17 --> 00:11:22
12%, nitrogen is about 5%,
and then there's a whole lot of

183
00:11:22 --> 00:11:28
other stuff present at lower levels,
phosphorus, sulfate, magnesium,

184
00:11:28 --> 00:11:34
manganese, selenium, etc.
This isn't a particularly helpful

185
00:11:34 --> 00:11:41
way to think about cells.
This is perhaps a more useful way,

186
00:11:41 --> 00:11:49
and that's to think about it in
terms of molecular composition.

187
00:11:49 --> 00:11:56
And we're about 80% water.

188
00:11:56 --> 00:12:00
Virtually all living organisms,
more or less the same, 80% water is

189
00:12:00 --> 00:12:05
what our cells are made up of.
And of the rest of them,

190
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
there are four major classes of
macromolecule,

191
00:12:09 --> 00:12:13
large biological molecules that make
up the rest of cells.

192
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
And that's what we're going to be
focusing on in a little bit.

193
00:12:17 --> 00:12:22
There are proteins, which I've
already mentioned today,

194
00:12:22 --> 00:12:26
and that's about 50% of it.
Nucleic acids, that's DNA and RNA,

195
00:12:26 --> 00:12:30
we'll say that's about 15%.
Carbohydrates,

196
00:12:30 --> 00:12:35
which we'll be talking about today.
Lipids about 10%.

197
00:12:35 --> 00:12:39
And there is a bunch of little
stuff that is important but makes up

198
00:12:39 --> 00:12:43
the remaining amount.
But to understand biology we're

199
00:12:43 --> 00:12:48
really going to have to try and
figure out how cells work.

200
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
We're going to need to talk about
the properties of those molecules.

201
00:12:52 --> 00:12:56
And just so you'll know, this
picture is actually,

202
00:12:56 --> 00:13:01
this was made by somebody at
Lawrence Berkeley National Labs.

203
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
As far as I know she still hasn't
published it.  This is an image of

204
00:13:04 --> 00:13:08
an actual cell.
It's made by a very fancy technique

205
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
called x-ray tomography where she
sort of takes a zillion little sort

206
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
of slices and then assembles the
whole thing.  This is a yeast cell.

207
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
That purple thing, artificially
colored, is the nucleus.

208
00:13:19 --> 00:13:23
This thing in the middle is a big
storage thing called a vacuole in

209
00:13:23 --> 00:13:27
the cell.  We cannot see the other
cellular components right now,

210
00:13:27 --> 00:13:31
but that is a real cell.
It looks like a textbook,

211
00:13:31 --> 00:13:35
but it's actually a yeast cell that
got its picture taken by this very

212
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
fancy thing.  So,
as I say, we're going to charge

213
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
right now into starting to think
about these various molecular forces

214
00:13:43 --> 00:13:47
that make possible,
that give these various biomolecules

215
00:13:47 --> 00:13:51
or biomacromolecules their
properties.  And I just want to give

216
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
you sort of a game plan for how
we're going to do this over the next

217
00:13:55 --> 00:13:59
couple of lessons, couple
of classes.

218
00:13:59 --> 00:14:08
They're sort of classes of chemical
forces.  And today we'll be talking

219
00:14:08 --> 00:14:17
about covalent bonds and hydrogen
bonds.  And we'll go onto to talk

220
00:14:17 --> 00:14:26
about other ones in the next class
or two.  And then we're going to

221
00:14:26 --> 00:14:35
talk about these biological
macromolecules that I just listed.

222
00:14:35 --> 00:14:40
Proteins.  Actually,
the order we'll be talking about

223
00:14:40 --> 00:14:45
them, carbohydrates,
nucleic acids, proteins and lipids.

224
00:14:45 --> 00:14:50
So the way I'm going to do this is
I can tell you about the properties

225
00:14:50 --> 00:14:56
of carbohydrates by just talking
about covalent bonds and hydrogen

226
00:14:56 --> 00:15:01
bonds.  And once we've discussed
those we'll go on here and I'll give

227
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
you a couple of examples.
And once we've learned some more

228
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
we'll go on and I'll give you some
other examples.

229
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
And, as I said,
in a second I'm going to say

230
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
covalent bonds.
It's going to seem boring.

231
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
Here's just something to sort of
keep in, we'll get another one in a

232
00:15:17 --> 00:15:21
minute, to look ahead,
why do we want to do this sort of

233
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
stuff?  I showed you this picture
the other day.

234
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
These are E. coli swimming along.
Those things I told you are those

235
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
sort of long spiral things are
bundles of protein filaments

236
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
called flagella.
They're being rotated by a motor at

237
00:15:33 --> 00:15:37
the end of the bacterium that's
rotating ten to a hundred thousand

238
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
RPM.  And that thing is moving at
such a rate, so many body lengths a

239
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
second that if it was me moving at
that speed I'd be going 300 miles

240
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
per hour that many body lengths.
So these are bacteria swimming

241
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
around.  The motor that drives them
is made of proteins.

242
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
And this is a textbook
representation of that motor.

243
00:15:56 --> 00:16:00
It has familiar parts to some of
you.

244
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
Here's a rotator.
There's a bushing.

245
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
There's a drive shaft and so on.
It's got parts that you would

246
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
recognize as an engineer,
but it's all made out of proteins.

247
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
And that's a textbook diagram.
What I want to show you in the next

248
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
slide is they've taken a whole lot
of electron micrographic images of

249
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
those things, and the resolution
isn't so good,

250
00:16:19 --> 00:16:23
but they averaged a whole bunch of
them.  And this is what it looks

251
00:16:23 --> 00:16:26
like.  So you can sort of see this
really is a machine.  It's

252
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
built of proteins.
And to understand how these machines

253
00:16:30 --> 00:16:34
work you have to understand some of
these forces.  So that's why I'm

254
00:16:34 --> 00:16:39
going to start in and we're going to
begin with covalent bonds so that

255
00:16:39 --> 00:16:43
we're all on the same page right
from the beginning.

256
00:16:43 --> 00:16:48
And another aspect,
as you'll see, even though you may

257
00:16:48 --> 00:16:52
have heard about some of these bonds
before, there's a new issue that's

258
00:16:52 --> 00:16:57
going to need to occupy your
attention.  And that is,

259
00:16:57 --> 00:17:01
what's the strength of the bond in
the context of temperatures and

260
00:17:01 --> 00:17:06
conditions that are relevant
to life?

261
00:17:06 --> 00:17:10
If you can break a bond at 1000
degrees it doesn't matter because

262
00:17:10 --> 00:17:14
you cannot have life at that
temperature.  You've got to be

263
00:17:14 --> 00:17:18
thinking about a much more
restricted temperature sort of range.

264
00:17:18 --> 00:17:22
So covalent bonds,
as most of you know,

265
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
this is the principle force that
holds atoms together.

266
00:17:26 --> 00:17:33
It involves a sharing of the

267
00:17:33 --> 00:17:38
electrons.  And an example you can
all do in your sleep,

268
00:17:38 --> 00:17:43
I'm sure.  If we take four hydrogen
atoms and a carbon atom we can come

269
00:17:43 --> 00:17:48
up with this molecule which has four
covalent bonds.

270
00:17:48 --> 00:17:53
This is methane.
That's the molecule that the cow we

271
00:17:53 --> 00:17:59
saw the other day burps
400 liters of.

272
00:17:59 --> 00:18:04
Those are the little bubbles you see
coming up when you walk around the

273
00:18:04 --> 00:18:10
edge of a lake.
And it's usually those pairs of

274
00:18:10 --> 00:18:16
electrons, as you know,
that are usually represented like

275
00:18:16 --> 00:18:22
this.  The typical length is about 0.
5 to 0.2 nanometers.

276
00:18:22 --> 00:18:28
And the important thing about these
bonds is these are strong.

277
00:18:28 --> 00:18:40
It takes about 83 kilocalories per

278
00:18:40 --> 00:18:53
mole to break a carbon-carbon bond.
So at physiologically relevant

279
00:18:53 --> 00:19:02
temperatures they don't break.
They can rotate,

280
00:19:02 --> 00:19:07
they can stretch and they can bend,
but they're not going to break.  And

281
00:19:07 --> 00:19:12
so if you have a carbon-carbon bond
in a biological organism it will be

282
00:19:12 --> 00:19:16
doing this.  The carbons will be
going this way.

283
00:19:16 --> 00:19:21
They'll be bending back and forth
this way but they won't be breaking.

284
00:19:21 --> 00:19:26
And to just give you a sense of how
far away they are from breaking,

285
00:19:26 --> 00:19:31
the energy of, say, one of these
vibrational modes is about 0.

286
00:19:31 --> 00:19:36
kilocalories per mole so that you
have --

287
00:19:36 --> 00:19:40
The average bond is so far away from
breaking, even though it's a

288
00:19:40 --> 00:19:44
distribution, and some are more than
others that our molecules stay

289
00:19:44 --> 00:19:49
together, which is good because we
wouldn't want our DNA flying apart

290
00:19:49 --> 00:19:53
because the covalent bonds were
breaking under physiological

291
00:19:53 --> 00:19:58
conditions.
But that also leads us to the need

292
00:19:58 --> 00:20:02
for one of the things that we'll
have to talk about,

293
00:20:02 --> 00:20:06
which is one of the great secretes
of life, is that the metabolism,

294
00:20:06 --> 00:20:10
all stages of life involve the
making and the breaking of bonds.

295
00:20:10 --> 00:20:14
And you cannot just add a platinum
catalyst and put it at 500 degrees

296
00:20:14 --> 00:20:18
centigrade under a thousand
atmospheres of pressure.

297
00:20:18 --> 00:20:22
All the chemistry that happens in
life has to take place in aqueous

298
00:20:22 --> 00:20:26
solution pretty close to pH 7 at
about, you know, 25, 37

299
00:20:26 --> 00:20:30
degree centigrade.
There are a few organisms that can

300
00:20:30 --> 00:20:34
do it out, but most of it is
somewhere around body temperature.

301
00:20:34 --> 00:20:37
Room temperate is where all that
has to take place.

302
00:20:37 --> 00:20:41
So what you can see is that there
had to be some,

303
00:20:41 --> 00:20:44
in order for life to occur there had
to be some invention that would let

304
00:20:44 --> 00:20:48
bonds be broken and be formed under
physiologically relevant conditions.

305
00:20:48 --> 00:20:51
And those are enzymes.  I know most
of you have heard of those.

306
00:20:51 --> 00:20:55
We'll talk about them in a maybe
more sublevel,

307
00:20:55 --> 00:20:59
beyond what some of you have heard
anyway.  But that --

308
00:20:59 --> 00:21:04
Keep in mind now that's the driving
force for why we need enzymes,

309
00:21:04 --> 00:21:10
because covalent bonds are so strong.
I also remind you that there are

310
00:21:10 --> 00:21:15
different types of covalent bonds.
That's a single bond.  This would

311
00:21:15 --> 00:21:21
be a double bond or a triple bond.
And they get stronger as you share

312
00:21:21 --> 00:21:27
more electrons.
It gets harder and harder to break

313
00:21:27 --> 00:21:32
them.
These are double and triple bonds

314
00:21:32 --> 00:21:37
called unsaturated bonds.
When we talk about unsaturated fats

315
00:21:37 --> 00:21:42
and things that's because they have
double bonds in them.

316
00:21:42 --> 00:21:47
So olive oil has double bonds in it
and beef fat, for example,

317
00:21:47 --> 00:21:52
doesn't.  Other molecules that have
double bonds that are important are

318
00:21:52 --> 00:21:58
oxygen and nitrogen gas,
which has got a triple bond.

319
00:21:58 --> 00:22:02
And when Penny talks to you about
the nitrogen cycle this is one of

320
00:22:02 --> 00:22:06
the really important ones thinking
about ecology because we all use

321
00:22:06 --> 00:22:10
nitrogen, but most organisms
including ourselves and most things

322
00:22:10 --> 00:22:15
on earth cannot break that bond.
Yet we all need nitrogen.  It has

323
00:22:15 --> 00:22:19
be what they called fixed,
so it's joined to something like

324
00:22:19 --> 00:22:23
ammonia or nitrite or something like
that.  And that little fluorescently

325
00:22:23 --> 00:22:27
labeled bacteria I showed you
invading a plant,

326
00:22:27 --> 00:22:32
we'll see it again,
is able to form a symbiosis of plant.

327
00:22:32 --> 00:22:36
It's one of the few creatures on
earth that knows how to break that

328
00:22:36 --> 00:22:40
bond.  And that's why you can get
plants that can grow,

329
00:22:40 --> 00:22:44
like peas and beans and alfalfa and
things that can grow without

330
00:22:44 --> 00:22:48
nitrogen fertilizer.
Because they have a little

331
00:22:48 --> 00:22:52
bacterium who knows how to break
that bond and they figured out how

332
00:22:52 --> 00:22:56
to get together and collaborate in a
symbiosis.  So these bonds are very

333
00:22:56 --> 00:23:00
important.  So there's another
characteristic of these bonds which

334
00:23:00 --> 00:23:05
is going to be very important for
thinking about biology.

335
00:23:05 --> 00:23:09
And it's known as chirality.
And it comes from the fact that our

336
00:23:09 --> 00:23:13
life on this planet is based on
carbon, and carbon's ability to form

337
00:23:13 --> 00:23:18
remarkable kinds of bonds.
And, as you see over there,

338
00:23:18 --> 00:23:22
carbon forms four bonds.  But right
now we have to start thinking in

339
00:23:22 --> 00:23:26
3-dimensional space because carbon
is a tetrahedron.  Carbon,

340
00:23:26 --> 00:23:31
four single bonds.
And they're in a tetrahedral

341
00:23:31 --> 00:23:37
arrangement.  So if I label them
like this, this means it's coming

342
00:23:37 --> 00:23:43
out of the board,
I'm sorry.  A, B, C.

343
00:23:43 --> 00:23:48
And that means it's going back into
the board.  So if I do a mirror

344
00:23:48 --> 00:23:54
image, if I looked at what this
would look like,

345
00:23:54 --> 00:24:00
if I could look at its reflection in
a mirror, I would see it

346
00:24:00 --> 00:24:05
would look like this.
So these are what are known as

347
00:24:05 --> 00:24:10
optical isomers.
And depending on how you are at

348
00:24:10 --> 00:24:14
thinking in 3-dimensions this may be
obvious to you or it may not be

349
00:24:14 --> 00:24:19
obvious to you,
but you cannot superimpose those.

350
00:24:19 --> 00:24:24
And this is critical because all
through biology there are carbons

351
00:24:24 --> 00:24:29
that have four different
substituents that join to them.

352
00:24:29 --> 00:24:33
And every time that occurs,
biology chooses one of those

353
00:24:33 --> 00:24:37
arrangements, not the other.
And we have sort of a macro way of

354
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
perhaps communicating this.
So you've been at the party at the

355
00:24:41 --> 00:24:46
dorm.  I was housemaster in
McCormick for six years a while back

356
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
so I've lived at least in that
environment.  It's early February,

357
00:24:50 --> 00:24:54
you're having to go back across the
Mass Ave bridge,

358
00:24:54 --> 00:24:58
it's minus 20 and the wind is
whipping along and your

359
00:24:58 --> 00:25:02
hands are freezing.
And you reach into your pocket to

360
00:25:02 --> 00:25:06
get your gloves and uh-oh,
two left gloves.  Right there you

361
00:25:06 --> 00:25:10
have the problem.
Biology, as a theme you'll hear

362
00:25:10 --> 00:25:14
over and over again,
is about fitting shapes.

363
00:25:14 --> 00:25:18
And your hands are mirror images of
each other.  And you could think of

364
00:25:18 --> 00:25:22
your gloves as being sort of a
receptor.  And if the receptor is

365
00:25:22 --> 00:25:26
designed to take your right hand,
take your left hand, I guess, let's

366
00:25:26 --> 00:25:30
say, you cannot get your right hand
into the glove.

367
00:25:30 --> 00:25:34
It just doesn't fit.
And it's at a molecular level.

368
00:25:34 --> 00:25:39
It's exactly that same thing.  So
we're going to have to worry as we

369
00:25:39 --> 00:25:43
go through this about not only how
many bonds there are,

370
00:25:43 --> 00:25:48
but this is why the exact molecular
shape, including this optical isomer

371
00:25:48 --> 00:25:52
issue is going to be very important.
There's another very important

372
00:25:52 --> 00:25:57
principle of covalent bonds that has,
again, a huge impact on biology.

373
00:25:57 --> 00:26:01
And that concerns how the atoms
involved in the forming that

374
00:26:01 --> 00:26:06
covalent bond think about
sharing electrons.

375
00:26:06 --> 00:26:10
In some cases the sharing is pretty
much equal, as in a carbon-carbon

376
00:26:10 --> 00:26:15
bond.  That would make sense since
it's the same thing on both sides.

377
00:26:15 --> 00:26:19
Or a carbon-hydrogen bond.  The
sharing of electrons is pretty much

378
00:26:19 --> 00:26:24
the same, so the electrons on
average are distributed in between

379
00:26:24 --> 00:26:29
them.  And this is what's known as a
nonpolar bond.

380
00:26:29 --> 00:26:35
However, there are important cases
of unequal sharing.

381
00:26:35 --> 00:26:41
And the characteristic of an atom
or an element that determines how

382
00:26:41 --> 00:26:47
this sharing goes is known as
electronegativity.

383
00:26:47 --> 00:26:53
And you could think of this of this
as sort of a euphemism for the

384
00:26:53 --> 00:26:59
greediness of an atom
for electrons.

385
00:26:59 --> 00:27:03
So if you have an oxygen-hydrogen
bond, oxygen is more electronegative

386
00:27:03 --> 00:27:07
than hydrogen.
What that means is that although

387
00:27:07 --> 00:27:12
the electrons are still shared,
this is not an ion or anything, the

388
00:27:12 --> 00:27:16
electrons are shared,
there's going to be a little bit of

389
00:27:16 --> 00:27:21
a negative charge on the oxygen and
a little bit of a positive charge on

390
00:27:21 --> 00:27:25
the hydrogen.  And that means you,
you know, this will have all sorts

391
00:27:25 --> 00:27:30
of consequences, as you'll
see in a minute.

392
00:27:30 --> 00:27:34
And there's one important molecule,
which if we did the molecular

393
00:27:34 --> 00:27:38
composition you can see there's a
lot of it around,

394
00:27:38 --> 00:27:43
and that's water.  And it's got two
OH bonds.  And here's where the

395
00:27:43 --> 00:27:47
structure of water is important,
that these two bonds are not 180

396
00:27:47 --> 00:27:52
degrees opposite to each other.
They're 104.5 degrees.  So you end

397
00:27:52 --> 00:27:56
up with a little negative charge
here, a little positive charge here,

398
00:27:56 --> 00:28:02
a little positive charge there.
And so every single water molecules

399
00:28:02 --> 00:28:08
sort of have a negative side and
more or less a positive kind of side.

400
00:28:08 --> 00:28:14
And this has consequences because
this means that the water molecules

401
00:28:14 --> 00:28:20
are going to interact.
And to understand that part I need

402
00:28:20 --> 00:28:26
to introduce you to this second
force which we know as the hydrogen

403
00:28:26 --> 00:28:35
bond.  And this is the --
This is a bond that takes place,

404
00:28:35 --> 00:28:45
that arises because of the slight
positive charge of an H bonded to

405
00:28:45 --> 00:28:57
oxygen or nitrogen --

406
00:28:57 --> 00:28:59
-- and the slight negative
charge --

407
00:28:59 --> 00:29:09
-- of the oxygen or the nitrogen

408
00:29:09 --> 00:29:14
itself.  And right in water we see
this be an issue,

409
00:29:14 --> 00:29:19
because if we have water like this
with a couple little bit of positive

410
00:29:19 --> 00:29:24
charges here and there and a little
negative charge here,

411
00:29:24 --> 00:29:29
and there's another water molecule
over here, a little positive charge,

412
00:29:29 --> 00:29:34
a little negative, a little positive,
we can get here what's known

413
00:29:34 --> 00:29:42
as a hydrogen bond.
The hydrogen bond is about

414
00:29:42 --> 00:29:53
one-twentieth the strength --

415
00:29:53 --> 00:29:57
-- of a covalent bond.
And that number is really important,

416
00:29:57 --> 00:30:01
because what that means is that at
temperatures that are relevant for

417
00:30:01 --> 00:30:05
life, not all the molecules will
have enough energy to break,

418
00:30:05 --> 00:30:09
in a population will have enough
energy to break that bond.

419
00:30:09 --> 00:30:15
But some of them will.
So hydrogen bonds, let me just

420
00:30:15 --> 00:30:21
write that down,
so at physiologically relevant

421
00:30:21 --> 00:30:35
temperatures some molecules --

422
00:30:35 --> 00:30:38
-- have the energy to break a
hydrogen bond.

423
00:30:38 --> 00:30:42
And we'll talk about it next time.
But probably many of you know that

424
00:30:42 --> 00:30:46
DNA is made of two strands.
And the whole principle of copying

425
00:30:46 --> 00:30:50
the genetic information is you can
pull the strands apart and copy the

426
00:30:50 --> 00:30:54
complimentary information.
And we'll spend a lot of time

427
00:30:54 --> 00:30:58
talking about that.
But the relevant thing for the

428
00:30:58 --> 00:31:02
moment is those two strands,
each of which are joined by covalent

429
00:31:02 --> 00:31:06
bonds, are held together by a whole
series of hydrogen bonds between the

430
00:31:06 --> 00:31:10
different base pairs.
And so right there sort of is the

431
00:31:10 --> 00:31:14
root of why the cells are able to
pull those apart,

432
00:31:14 --> 00:31:18
put them together.
And so these hydrogen bonds are

433
00:31:18 --> 00:31:22
really, really important.
And because our life on this planet

434
00:31:22 --> 00:31:26
is based, we're water-based,
and the reason what is such a good

435
00:31:26 --> 00:31:31
solvent is that it is able to form
these hydrogen bonds.

436
00:31:31 --> 00:31:34
So this is just a little movie
showing the hydrogen bonds,

437
00:31:34 --> 00:31:38
a little simulation of how they can
move around and rotate.

438
00:31:38 --> 00:31:42
The green thing would be the
hydrogen bonds here.

439
00:31:42 --> 00:31:46
This is not really a full
representation because the water

440
00:31:46 --> 00:31:49
molecules are constantly changing
partners so they form little cages

441
00:31:49 --> 00:31:53
and little shells,
but they keep forming hydrogen bonds.

442
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
They'll break one with one water
molecule and immediately reform with

443
00:31:57 --> 00:32:01
another.  This is a simulation
that someone did.

444
00:32:01 --> 00:32:04
It's a picosecond of what would
happen to water molecules at zero

445
00:32:04 --> 00:32:07
degrees centigrade where they're
liquid.  So, at this point,

446
00:32:07 --> 00:32:11
they haven't frozen but they're just
above that.  And you can sort of get

447
00:32:11 --> 00:32:14
the sense how they're changing
partners here.

448
00:32:14 --> 00:32:18
Here's another simulation done at
100 degrees centigrade.

449
00:32:18 --> 00:32:21
So this would be a boiling
temperature.  And what you can see

450
00:32:21 --> 00:32:25
now is every now and then one of the
molecules gets enough energy to

451
00:32:25 --> 00:32:28
break free of these cages.
And that, when you're watching

452
00:32:28 --> 00:32:32
something boil in a kettle,
that, at a molecular level, is

453
00:32:32 --> 00:32:36
what's happening,
is one or another molecule is

454
00:32:36 --> 00:32:39
finally getting enough energy to
break free of this sort of change of

455
00:32:39 --> 00:32:43
hydrogen bonds that are formed.
And it's when we go to think about

456
00:32:43 --> 00:32:47
how things interact in water,
when you dissolve sugar in water or

457
00:32:47 --> 00:32:50
something in water,
you try and dissolve butter in water,

458
00:32:50 --> 00:32:54
when you stick something into water
you have to break a whole lot of

459
00:32:54 --> 00:32:58
bonds.  So there's an energy cost to
just simply putting something

460
00:32:58 --> 00:33:02
into water.
And what makes things dissolve or

461
00:33:02 --> 00:33:06
not is whether once they're in there
they can form bonds back again

462
00:33:06 --> 00:33:10
because water is carbon and hydrogen
bonds.  There is no polarity.

463
00:33:10 --> 00:33:14
To get it to dissolve you'd have to
break hydrogen bonds.

464
00:33:14 --> 00:33:18
That costs energy.  And it cannot
form any because it's only got

465
00:33:18 --> 00:33:22
nonpolar bonds in the butter so the
butter floats around on the water.

466
00:33:22 --> 00:33:27
But this is really a very, very
important force.

467
00:33:27 --> 00:33:31
And, in fact, you know,
this is why when some of the really

468
00:33:31 --> 00:33:36
interesting properties of water come
from.  You all know about surface

469
00:33:36 --> 00:33:40
tension.  You've watched little bugs
skate around on the surface of the

470
00:33:40 --> 00:33:45
water.  This is the lizard that
lives in the rainforest of Central

471
00:33:45 --> 00:33:49
and South America,
and it's about two and a half feet

472
00:33:49 --> 00:33:54
long.  And it can take advantage of
this surface tension that's due to

473
00:33:54 --> 00:33:59
the hydrogen bonding of water to go
scooting right across the water.

474
00:33:59 --> 00:34:02
This is not the greatest of videos.
It's what I've managed to find so

475
00:34:02 --> 00:34:06
far, but you get the idea.
It actually runs across the water.

476
00:34:06 --> 00:34:09
And you're watching the hydrogen
bonding in action here.

477
00:34:09 --> 00:34:13
When I was a grad student my work
thesis was on the synthesis of

478
00:34:13 --> 00:34:16
ribonucleotides,
little pieces of RNA.

479
00:34:16 --> 00:34:20
And I went in a thesis competition.
And at the end, where you're

480
00:34:20 --> 00:34:23
supposed to give a talk about your
thesis, and there were four of us,

481
00:34:23 --> 00:34:27
I thought, well, at least I have a
fighting chance.

482
00:34:27 --> 00:34:30
And when I got in there it turned
out one of the other people who was

483
00:34:30 --> 00:34:33
competing was a guy who studied this
lizard, so his talk was full of

484
00:34:33 --> 00:34:37
movies of these lizards running back
and forth across ponds of water.

485
00:34:37 --> 00:34:40
And I thought I'm dead meat.  But
it actually turned out I won it,

486
00:34:40 --> 00:34:44
so I was very surprised.  But every
time I see something like this it

487
00:34:44 --> 00:34:47
reminds me of it.
OK.  And just to remind you,

488
00:34:47 --> 00:34:51
too, I mean you may not have been
thinking of it in this way,

489
00:34:51 --> 00:34:54
but of course what was all that fuss
about when they sent the expeditions

490
00:34:54 --> 00:34:58
to mars?  They were looking
for traces of water.

491
00:34:58 --> 00:35:02
And why is that so important?
It's because water has this amazing

492
00:35:02 --> 00:35:06
capacity to form hydrogen bonds and
be the solvent that can let life go.

493
00:35:06 --> 00:35:10
The moon on triton has methane.
All nonpolar bonds,

494
00:35:10 --> 00:35:14
they're talking about raining
methane and rivers of liquid methane

495
00:35:14 --> 00:35:18
and stuff.  You might think about
whether it be possible to design a

496
00:35:18 --> 00:35:22
life form or not or at least what
ways things would have to

497
00:35:22 --> 00:35:27
be different.  OK.
And we've done enough that I can

498
00:35:27 --> 00:35:33
quickly now introduce you to our
first class of molecules which are

499
00:35:33 --> 00:35:39
carbohydrates.
Julia, would you mind flipping that

500
00:35:39 --> 00:35:45
light back on for a minute?
OK.  So carbohydrates have the

501
00:35:45 --> 00:35:51
general property,
general formula.  They're CA20.

502
00:35:51 --> 00:35:57
And you can have different numbers
of them.

503
00:35:57 --> 00:36:05
N-1 carbons have a COH bond.
That's known as a hydroxyl group.

504
00:36:05 --> 00:36:13
And one carbon has a double bond
oxygen which is either known as an

505
00:36:13 --> 00:36:21
aldehyde if it's at the end of a
chain or as a ketone if it's in the

506
00:36:21 --> 00:36:29
middle.  And these things can come
in different numbers.

507
00:36:29 --> 00:36:33
So if N equals three it's a triose.
If N equals five it's a pentose.

508
00:36:33 --> 00:36:38
The sugars that you'll see in DNA
and RNA are pentoses.

509
00:36:38 --> 00:36:43
They're five carbon units.
A six carbon unit is a hexose.

510
00:36:43 --> 00:36:48
And a very common hexose that
you're all familiar with,

511
00:36:48 --> 00:36:53
at least familiar with the name of
is glucose.  And the structure of

512
00:36:53 --> 00:36:58
glucose in a linear form,
if I draw it out here, it's got the

513
00:36:58 --> 00:37:03
double bond at one end,
so it's an aldehyde in that case.

514
00:37:03 --> 00:37:07
And then there's an OH this way,
OH this way, OH, let's see.  One,

515
00:37:07 --> 00:37:12
two, three, four, five, six.  OH.
And it's just going off the bottom

516
00:37:12 --> 00:37:17
of the end here,
bottom of the board for some of you

517
00:37:17 --> 00:37:22
probably.  But we have hydrogens in
the other places.

518
00:37:22 --> 00:37:26
Now, what I had to do in order to
put up this depiction was kind of

519
00:37:26 --> 00:37:31
flatten this molecule,
which you'll know every one of these

520
00:37:31 --> 00:37:36
is a tetrahedral arrangement.
And flatten it down so I could write

521
00:37:36 --> 00:37:40
it on the board.
So there are actually four chiral

522
00:37:40 --> 00:37:45
centers in a glucose molecule.
And, furthermore, although this is

523
00:37:45 --> 00:37:49
a representation that you can find
in textbooks and I can write it on

524
00:37:49 --> 00:37:54
the board that's not how it appears
in nature.  What happens is that the

525
00:37:54 --> 00:37:58
oxygen here comes up and actually
cyclizes to this carbon.

526
00:37:58 --> 00:38:03
And this hydrogen goes and sits up
here.

527
00:38:03 --> 00:38:07
And it gives you,
the way glucose is actually found in

528
00:38:07 --> 00:38:12
solution, this would be what's known
as beta-glucose.

529
00:38:12 --> 00:38:17
And the reason I'm saying beta is
we've got a new chiral center that's

530
00:38:17 --> 00:38:22
formed by this cyclization.
And just to give you a sense of

531
00:38:22 --> 00:38:27
where we are, this is one,
two, three, four, five, six going

532
00:38:27 --> 00:38:32
this way.
And over here it's one,

533
00:38:32 --> 00:38:36
two, three, four, five and six that
way.  And you can sit there and work

534
00:38:36 --> 00:38:40
this out yourself afterwards.
This is known as a pyranose ring

535
00:38:40 --> 00:38:44
because it's got,
it's actually a six-member ring,

536
00:38:44 --> 00:38:49
but you can see one of the oxygens
is now part of the ring and the

537
00:38:49 --> 00:38:53
extra carbon is sticking out here.
And in solution, because of this

538
00:38:53 --> 00:38:57
new chiral center,
we've now got the possibility of

539
00:38:57 --> 00:39:02
this thing joining so that the OH is
up or the OH is down.

540
00:39:02 --> 00:39:05
And when it's up,
the OH is up, that's known as the

541
00:39:05 --> 00:39:09
beta form.  And if the OH is down,
that's known as the alpha form.  So,

542
00:39:09 --> 00:39:13
again, we've got to keep our eyes on
all these chiral centers.

543
00:39:13 --> 00:39:17
This kind of depiction, again,
is sort of hard to draw.  So, again,

544
00:39:17 --> 00:39:21
people tend to sort of flatten it
out.  And you'll see this kind of

545
00:39:21 --> 00:39:25
representation.
You have to realize that this is

546
00:39:25 --> 00:39:29
approximately the 3-dimensional
shape.  This is a representation.

547
00:39:29 --> 00:39:34
Here's beta-glucose there.
Every time that you change the

548
00:39:34 --> 00:39:39
position of one of these hydroxyls,
we end up with another sugar.  So

549
00:39:39 --> 00:39:44
this is beta-galactose,
sugar with very different properties.

550
00:39:44 --> 00:39:50
And the difference is here the
hydroxyl is up,

551
00:39:50 --> 00:39:55
here the hydroxyl is down.
Two different sugars, two different

552
00:39:55 --> 00:40:01
properties, but as simple
a difference as that.

553
00:40:01 --> 00:40:07
And then a thing that happens in
nature is you can join different

554
00:40:07 --> 00:40:13
sugar molecules together by a
principle that you'll see over and

555
00:40:13 --> 00:40:19
over again.  And that you'll split
out a molecule of water and you get

556
00:40:19 --> 00:40:25
a new covalent bond where this
oxygen joins over to the curb and

557
00:40:25 --> 00:40:32
over here.  And what that gives you
is galactose beta-1,4 glucose.

558
00:40:32 --> 00:40:36
This beta-1, 4 glucose is a molecule
that you know as lactose

559
00:40:36 --> 00:40:44
or milk sugar.

560
00:40:44 --> 00:40:48
And part of the reason we know about
it is because in order to metabolize

561
00:40:48 --> 00:40:53
that you need to have a special
enzyme that cuts right here.

562
00:40:53 --> 00:40:58
That enzyme is known as
beta-galactosidase.

563
00:40:58 --> 00:41:02
That's an enzyme.
It's a protein,

564
00:41:02 --> 00:41:05
which we'll be talking about in the
coming lectures,

565
00:41:05 --> 00:41:09
and it's able to cause this bond to
break.  And what happens when you

566
00:41:09 --> 00:41:12
become lactose intolerant is you
lose the beta-galactosidase that we

567
00:41:12 --> 00:41:15
all have as a baby,
because we need to be able to eat

568
00:41:15 --> 00:41:18
milk.  And if you don't have it then
the lactose passes through your

569
00:41:18 --> 00:41:22
stomach without getting metabolized.
It gets into your intestine and

570
00:41:22 --> 00:41:25
there are those ten to the fourth
bacteria.  They metabolize it,

571
00:41:25 --> 00:41:28
break that bond, and then that
causes the gas and discomfort that's

572
00:41:28 --> 00:41:32
associated with lactose
intolerance.

573
00:41:32 --> 00:41:36
So all the textbooks use lactose as
the, beta-galactosidase as the

574
00:41:36 --> 00:41:40
common enzyme.
So the first time I thought that

575
00:41:40 --> 00:41:45
I'd teach this course I thought,
boy, I have a really good idea.  I'm

576
00:41:45 --> 00:41:49
going to come up with a sample
enzyme that's different,

577
00:41:49 --> 00:41:53
but I have to learn what it was.
And it was inspired by there's this

578
00:41:53 --> 00:41:58
product called Beano which is
supposed to reduce the side effects

579
00:41:58 --> 00:42:02
that are commonly associated with
eating beans, which probably many of

580
00:42:02 --> 00:42:07
you are familiar with from summer
camps and things.

581
00:42:07 --> 00:42:09
And the technical term is flatulents.
But, in any case,

582
00:42:09 --> 00:42:12
this was supposed to be something
that reduced flatulents.

583
00:42:12 --> 00:42:15
So I thought it's got to be an
enzyme.  I know it had something to

584
00:42:15 --> 00:42:18
do with all of the saccharide s that
will change the sugar.

585
00:42:18 --> 00:42:21
So I looked at the little thing of
Beano, and it said Hotline,

586
00:42:21 --> 00:42:24
any questions call.  So I phoned up
and said, hi, this is kind of an

587
00:42:24 --> 00:42:27
unusual question.
I'm a college professor and I'm

588
00:42:27 --> 00:42:30
going to be teaching an introductory
biology course.

589
00:42:30 --> 00:42:33
And I was wondering if I could find
out what enzyme you had in Beano and

590
00:42:33 --> 00:42:36
what it did to what was in the beans.
And I said, you know,

591
00:42:36 --> 00:42:40
it's really sort of an odd question
but, you know,

592
00:42:40 --> 00:42:43
maybe I could talk to one of the
scientists in the lab.

593
00:42:43 --> 00:42:47
And a woman says, hello,
Beano.  And she listens to me.

594
00:42:47 --> 00:42:50
And she says, yes, we have a
special package we send out to

595
00:42:50 --> 00:42:54
college professors.
And the next thing I knew I got

596
00:42:54 --> 00:42:59
this huge flood of stuff.
So I am now able to quickly tell you

597
00:42:59 --> 00:43:05
why beans are the musical fruit.
And the basis of it is if you join

598
00:43:05 --> 00:43:11
a glucose and a fructose together by
an alpha-1, 2 linkage you get

599
00:43:11 --> 00:43:17
sucrose.  And you all know that's
table sugar.  We can eat sucrose not

600
00:43:17 --> 00:43:23
problem.  But what beans have is
beans have a galactose alpha-1,

601
00:43:23 --> 00:43:28
6 linkage to sucrose.
Or they actually,

602
00:43:28 --> 00:43:33
sometimes they have two galactose
alpha-1, 6 linkages to sucrose and

603
00:43:33 --> 00:43:37
we cannot metabolize them.
And that's sort of related to the

604
00:43:37 --> 00:43:42
same idea as the glucose intolerance
that they go through a stomach,

605
00:43:42 --> 00:43:47
and then the bacteria know how to
break that bond and that causes the

606
00:43:47 --> 00:43:51
problems that you encountered at
summer camp.  And so what Beano

607
00:43:51 --> 00:43:56
turned out to be is it's a sort of
low-tech biotech product.

608
00:43:56 --> 00:44:01
It's a food-grade mold called
neurospora.  And it's a very,

609
00:44:01 --> 00:44:06
very crude preparation of an alpha-1,
6 galactosidase.

610
00:44:06 --> 00:44:10
In other words,
an enzyme that can break that

611
00:44:10 --> 00:44:14
molecule.  And once it breaks it you
have sucrose, which we can eat,

612
00:44:14 --> 00:44:18
and galactose, which we know what to
do with.  And that's the basis of

613
00:44:18 --> 00:44:22
that.  So the very last thing is to
talk about polysaccharides.

614
00:44:22 --> 00:44:26
These come when you join together
multiple sugars.

615
00:44:26 --> 00:44:30
And, as you can appreciate by now,
there are many, many ways of joining

616
00:44:30 --> 00:44:35
sugars together.
But suppose we take N glucoses.

617
00:44:35 --> 00:44:43
There are two common ways they can
get joined.  They can get joined

618
00:44:43 --> 00:44:51
together by alpha-1,
4 bonds.  And these give a helical

619
00:44:51 --> 00:44:59
confirmation.  And you know these as
starch or glycogen.

620
00:44:59 --> 00:45:04
These are energy storage molecules.
And I've run marathons,

621
00:45:04 --> 00:45:07
some of you may have, but at least
you probably know about

622
00:45:07 --> 00:45:10
carbo-loading.
What you're trying to then before

623
00:45:10 --> 00:45:14
you go is you're eating pasta and
everything, which is full of

624
00:45:14 --> 00:45:17
starches, so it's got polymerized
sugars.  And you're trying to get

625
00:45:17 --> 00:45:20
your body to take these in and
polymerize them into glycogen so

626
00:45:20 --> 00:45:23
your liver is as loaded with
glycogen before you start the race.

627
00:45:23 --> 00:45:26
And hitting the wall in a marathon
is when you run out of glycogen.

628
00:45:26 --> 00:45:30
And then you start burning fatty
acids and it's no fun at all.

629
00:45:30 --> 00:45:34
But that's what carbo-loading is all
about, is manipulating glucoses that

630
00:45:34 --> 00:45:39
are in an alpha-1,
4 confirmation, if you just make a

631
00:45:39 --> 00:45:43
beta-1, 4 confirmation.
So the only difference that's

632
00:45:43 --> 00:45:48
happening in the way we join
glucoses together is whether the

633
00:45:48 --> 00:45:53
hydroxyl is up or down when you join
the two of them together.

634
00:45:53 --> 00:45:57
You get something that's a linear
molecule that forms hydrogen bonds

635
00:45:57 --> 00:46:02
between the sugars.
So you have a linear chain of sugars.

636
00:46:02 --> 00:46:06
And I'm not going to show the
details of the hydrogen bond,

637
00:46:06 --> 00:46:10
but you have one chain going this
way and another chain of sugars here.

638
00:46:10 --> 00:46:14
And you can get hydrogen bonds
between them.  And you know this as

639
00:46:14 --> 00:46:18
cellulose.  So there are two very
important biomolecules that are made

640
00:46:18 --> 00:46:22
up of glucose.
That's just some glucose there.

641
00:46:22 --> 00:46:26
And if you join them by alpha-1,
4 linkages you get starch, corn

642
00:46:26 --> 00:46:31
starch, which you've
all encountered.

643
00:46:31 --> 00:46:35
If you join them by hydroxyl in the
other direction you get cellulose.

644
00:46:35 --> 00:46:39
Cellulose is important in biology.
It's what plants make their cell

645
00:46:39 --> 00:46:44
walls of.  That's why you can have
trees that are so enormously high.

646
00:46:44 --> 00:46:48
And I guess I'll close with one
last.  So most of the paper we get

647
00:46:48 --> 00:46:53
from cellulose is from trees.
If you've ever tried and make beer

648
00:46:53 --> 00:46:57
or wine or something,
you probably know you've got to keep

649
00:46:57 --> 00:47:02
fruit flies away or you're
going to get vinegar.

650
00:47:02 --> 00:47:07
And the reason you get vinegar is
that the fruit flies carry on their

651
00:47:07 --> 00:47:12
feet a bacterium called
acidobacteria.

652
00:47:12 --> 00:47:17
And it likes to live at the surface
between the water and the air.

653
00:47:17 --> 00:47:22
And what it does then, in order to
do that is it makes cellulose,

654
00:47:22 --> 00:47:27
and it floats itself right at the,
it makes this great thick mat of

655
00:47:27 --> 00:47:32
cellulose.  And it floats itself
right at the air surface interface.

656
00:47:32 --> 00:47:36
And you can get a mat that's half an
inch thick of absolutely perfect

657
00:47:36 --> 00:47:41
cellulose.  And so you don't ever
want to see that if you're trying to

658
00:47:41 --> 00:47:45
make beer or wine or something.
But it's a bacterium that's making

659
00:47:45 --> 00:47:50
this molecule.
So you find it in other places

660
00:47:50 --> 00:47:53
besides trees.  So, OK, we'll
see you on Monday.
