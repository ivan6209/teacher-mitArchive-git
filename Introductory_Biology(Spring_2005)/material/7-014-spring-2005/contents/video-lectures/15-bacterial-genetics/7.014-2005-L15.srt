1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
So in this last lecture,
what I'd like to do is I'd like to

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:11
now begin to talk about genetics.
And when we talked early on in the

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:17
semester I was showing you this way
that you can study biological

4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:23
function.  Biochemists,
for the most part, study how

5
00:00:23 --> 00:00:29
proteins work.
And what genetics does,

6
00:00:29 --> 00:00:35
steadying function, it's enable one
to discover genes.

7
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
And the molecular biology that we're
going to be talking about in the

8
00:00:39 --> 00:00:44
back part of the course has been
really totally amazing because it's

9
00:00:44 --> 00:00:48
allowed one to go back and forth
between genes and proteins,

10
00:00:48 --> 00:00:53
something that used to be very,
very hard until recombinant DNA came

11
00:00:53 --> 00:00:58
into the picture.
Now, up until now I've sort of

12
00:00:58 --> 00:01:03
mentioned genetics
as we went along.

13
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
But we haven't really talked about
it as a discipline and the kind of

14
00:01:07 --> 00:01:12
power that this experimental
approach has.  Thank you.

15
00:01:12 --> 00:01:17
I could have done this without
notes but it's easier to have them.

16
00:01:17 --> 00:01:22
I just have my little help here.
So I know some of you have written

17
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
in your comments I didn't think
there was going to be

18
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
so much chemistry.
Well, we had a little bit of a bout

19
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
with chemistry.
And then some of you found that we

20
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
were going away from bonds and
thinking about 3-dimensionality,

21
00:01:36 --> 00:01:39
and that was another kind of
thinking.  And then sort of trying

22
00:01:39 --> 00:01:42
to work through the genetic code is
almost another.

23
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
And I think you'll find here,
as we start to go through genetics

24
00:01:44 --> 00:01:47
that you have to stretch your brain
in another direction.

25
00:01:47 --> 00:01:50
And part of one of the really
interesting things about biology

26
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
today is you cannot just sort of
think about it in one kind of very

27
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
comfortable way of thinking and
really take advantage of everything

28
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
that's out there.
You need to be able to talk in

29
00:01:58 --> 00:02:02
multiple languages and multiple
disciplines.  And so today I want to

30
00:02:02 --> 00:02:06
just kind of briefly give you an
introductory sense of how genetics,

31
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
that I hope will give you, let you
see the power of it by very,

32
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
very simple techniques.  And
remember what you're doing here is

33
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
you're studying variants of the
living organism.

34
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
So if you see something that's
wrong with it you know it's

35
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
important, but you know the rest of
the job is to figure out what's

36
00:02:24 --> 00:02:28
wrong.  And I've sort of given you
and used some examples.

37
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
When we talked about the
streptococcus with the smooth

38
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
colonies, I talked about how people
had noticed rough colonies.

39
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
Well, those sorts of things had
been a change in the DNA and they

40
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
weren't making these polysaccharide
capsules anymore.

41
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
Or when I talked to you about the
mutant bacteria that had lost

42
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
mismatch repair,
they had a high mutation frequency

43
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
compared to a wild type.
So up until now I've sort of

44
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
mentioned them,
but we haven't really talked about

45
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
how one goes about studying things
in a systematic genetic way.

46
00:02:59 --> 00:03:05
So let me begin with just a few
definitions.  I realize this is a

47
00:03:05 --> 00:03:11
little dry but we need to make sure
that we're all on the same page in

48
00:03:11 --> 00:03:17
terms of the language.
So a mutant is a variant of a

49
00:03:17 --> 00:03:28
normal organism.

50
00:03:28 --> 00:03:33
It has a change in its DNA and the
kinds of mutants can vary all over

51
00:03:33 --> 00:03:38
the map.  For example,
if we had an E. coli that was,

52
00:03:38 --> 00:03:43
we might call it penn-resistant,
that could mean it was resistant to

53
00:03:43 --> 00:03:48
penicillin and would grow in the
presence of the antibiotics.

54
00:03:48 --> 00:03:54
Whereas, ordinary ones would die.
Or if we had what we call a

55
00:03:54 --> 00:03:59
his-minus mutant broken in the
biosynthesis of histidine

56
00:03:59 --> 00:04:07
won't grow --

57
00:04:07 --> 00:04:12
-- unless you add histidine to the
medium.  Those are a couple of

58
00:04:12 --> 00:04:18
simple examples.
When we start right after lecturing,

59
00:04:18 --> 00:04:23
when I come back,
I'm going to begin with Mendel,

60
00:04:23 --> 00:04:29
which is the more classic and usual
way of teaching genetics.

61
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
And he used various traits of peas.
Yellow and green seeds and wrinkled

62
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
and round.  And you can see what he
was working with there.

63
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
Another favorite organism for
genetic study has been the fruit fly

64
00:04:41 --> 00:04:46
or drosophila.
You can even see that they have red

65
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
eyes.  If you take a close look next
time if one lands on your sandwich

66
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
or your drink or something in the
summer.  But you can see,

67
00:04:54 --> 00:04:59
for example, people were able to get
white mutants that have white eyes.

68
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
There's something broken in making
the pigment that's going to make it

69
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
red.  Here's an even weirder one.
This is a single mutation in

70
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
drosophila.  It affects a
developmental process instead of

71
00:05:08 --> 00:05:12
something else.
And what happens is this is a

72
00:05:12 --> 00:05:15
drosophila head.
And normally there are antennae

73
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
that grow out of the top of the head.
And you can see what's happened in

74
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
this mutant is there's a pair of
legs growing out of the top of the

75
00:05:22 --> 00:05:25
head.  It's just a single gene
that's been changed,

76
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
but it's a gene that plays a role in
the developmental program,

77
00:05:28 --> 00:05:32
the patterning that makes certain
cells become specialized to become

78
00:05:32 --> 00:05:36
certain other things.
So it's just to give you an idea.

79
00:05:36 --> 00:05:40
And I showed you these.  We've
talked about the xeroderma

80
00:05:40 --> 00:05:44
pigmentosum, one change.
A person with this has got a gene

81
00:05:44 --> 00:05:48
that's broken in dealing with damage
from UV.  Or I've given you an

82
00:05:48 --> 00:05:53
example of what they call Werner
syndrome where a change in a single

83
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
gene, it's actually a kind of gene
whose proteins are involved in

84
00:05:57 --> 00:06:01
unwinding DNA,
of all things, can give you this

85
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
premature aging phenotype where the
woman looks normal at 16 but older

86
00:06:05 --> 00:06:11
at the age of 48.
So all of these are,

87
00:06:11 --> 00:06:18
if you will, mutants that are a
variant of a wild type.

88
00:06:18 --> 00:06:25
And then this is something people
often get confused between these two

89
00:06:25 --> 00:06:32
terms.  The mutation is the actual
change in the DNA.

90
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
Now, one other thing that's sort of
implicit in this definition is that

91
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
we know what a normal organism is.
Well, if you look around this room,

92
00:06:39 --> 00:06:43
what's a normal human?  Well, I'm OK
but I don't know about the rest of

93
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
you.  I'm sure we all feel that way,
but we have a lot of variation in it.

94
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
So, to some extent,
it's an operational definition.

95
00:06:50 --> 00:06:54
And most often it's applied, if
you're studying something like

96
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
drosophila or E.
coli, someone has been propagating a

97
00:06:58 --> 00:07:02
particular bacterial isolate in the
lab for a long time.

98
00:07:02 --> 00:07:07
And you call that one the wild type,
even though, in fact, in the case of

99
00:07:07 --> 00:07:12
an E. coli, it may have changed a
bit so it likes to grow in the

100
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
conditions that it finds in the lab.
But this sort of normal is an

101
00:07:18 --> 00:07:23
operational definition.
Now, another important term that

102
00:07:23 --> 00:07:29
geneticists use all the time is the
phenotype.  The word phenotype.

103
00:07:29 --> 00:07:36
And that's the ensemble --

104
00:07:36 --> 00:07:45
-- of observable characteristics --

105
00:07:45 --> 00:07:53
-- of an organism.

106
00:07:53 --> 00:08:01
For example, in these resistance to

107
00:08:01 --> 00:08:07
penicillin would be an example of a
phenotype.  A mutant that had

108
00:08:07 --> 00:08:13
acquired the resistance would have
the phenotype of being resistant.

109
00:08:13 --> 00:08:19
Sometimes these phenotypes can be a
little subtle.

110
00:08:19 --> 00:08:25
A conditional phenotype would be a
phenotype that you could observe

111
00:08:25 --> 00:08:31
under one characteristic
and not in another.

112
00:08:31 --> 00:08:36
For example, a temperature
sensitive phenotype --

113
00:08:36 --> 00:08:46
Whatever it might be.

114
00:08:46 --> 00:08:52
For example, it could be wild type
at let's say 30 degrees but mutant

115
00:08:52 --> 00:08:58
at 37 degrees centigrade.
That may sound like a sort of

116
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
fiddly little thing.
Why am I telling you about a

117
00:09:02 --> 00:09:06
conditional phenotype right off?
Well, suppose you wanted to study a

118
00:09:06 --> 00:09:10
DNA polymerase.
be it E. coli or me,

119
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
and it's the one that replicates
your DNA?  If we get a mutant that

120
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
just kills, knocks out the activity
of the gene we have no living

121
00:09:17 --> 00:09:21
organism to study,
we cannot do any genetics.

122
00:09:21 --> 00:09:25
But you can work around that.
You can do genetics with essential

123
00:09:25 --> 00:09:29
functions if you get a mutant where
you see the mutant phenotypes,

124
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
let's say, at the high temperature
but not at a low temperature.

125
00:09:33 --> 00:09:36
And what that kind of thing usually
comes from is a change in the

126
00:09:36 --> 00:09:40
protein where the protein has one
amino acid changed to something else

127
00:09:40 --> 00:09:44
and it folds up,
and at the lower temperature it's

128
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48
able to fold up and do its thing.
But it's not quite as stable as the

129
00:09:48 --> 00:09:52
original protein.
And if you raise the temperature it

130
00:09:52 --> 00:09:56
unfolds a bit,
and once it unfolds it doesn't work

131
00:09:56 --> 00:10:00
or it gets degraded or something
like that.  OK.

132
00:10:00 --> 00:10:06
So that's phenotype.
The genotype then refers to the

133
00:10:06 --> 00:10:12
state of the organism's genetic
material with respect to whether its

134
00:10:12 --> 00:10:19
wild type differs from it.
So let me just put that down.

135
00:10:19 --> 00:10:27
So this refers to the state --

136
00:10:27 --> 00:10:33
-- of the organism's

137
00:10:33 --> 00:10:42
genetic material --

138
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
-- with respect to whether it's wild
type or it's mutant.

139
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
There's a key distinction,
even though they sort of sound the

140
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
same.  This is what you can see if
you look at it but this is what's

141
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
actually changed.
The genotype is what's actually

142
00:10:58 --> 00:11:02
changed in the DNA.
And there's a caution.

143
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
If it's something like a bacterium
it's fine because it's only got one

144
00:11:06 --> 00:11:11
copy of every gene.
If I knock out a gene for making

145
00:11:11 --> 00:11:16
histidine it cannot make histidine.
The genotype and the phenotype are

146
00:11:16 --> 00:11:20
the same.  But if you have a diploid
organism, which is the kind of

147
00:11:20 --> 00:11:25
organism that we are and peas are
and fruit flies are,

148
00:11:25 --> 00:11:30
there are two copies of most genes,
one from mom and one from dad.

149
00:11:30 --> 00:11:36
And the only exceptions are the ones
involved with the sex chromosomes.

150
00:11:36 --> 00:11:43
Then you can get to something else,
a more complicated situation.

151
00:11:43 --> 00:11:49
Because let's say we have a usual
thing where both copies of the gene

152
00:11:49 --> 00:11:56
are plus, then the phenotype is wild
type, but if we were to break one of

153
00:11:56 --> 00:12:03
those copies by a mutation this one
is still wild type.

154
00:12:03 --> 00:12:08
The phenotype is still its wild type.
You cannot tell from looking at it

155
00:12:08 --> 00:12:14
that this one is different than that
one.  And one of the really

156
00:12:14 --> 00:12:19
brilliant insights that Mendel had
when he was looking at peas was he

157
00:12:19 --> 00:12:25
would take things that were wrinkled
and round and crossed them and he'd

158
00:12:25 --> 00:12:30
see mixtures of things.
And he realized some of those things

159
00:12:30 --> 00:12:34
in there weren't the same as either
the parents but they resembled one

160
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
of the parents.
And I'll take you through that in

161
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
the next thing.
So it's just a caution at the

162
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
moment that you have to be careful
that phenotype and genotype are not

163
00:12:46 --> 00:12:50
always the same.
And then I've used the word gene.

164
00:12:50 --> 00:13:00
That's the discrete unit --

165
00:13:00 --> 00:13:05
-- of genetic information.
We talked the other day about the

166
00:13:05 --> 00:13:10
lacZ gene that encodes
beta-galactosidase.

167
00:13:10 --> 00:13:15
OK.  So I think what I'd like to do,
if I tell you,

168
00:13:15 --> 00:13:20
for example, we made a lot of
mutants of E. coli that were broken

169
00:13:20 --> 00:13:25
by the biosynthesis of histidine and
gave them to you,

170
00:13:25 --> 00:13:30
if you were a good biochemist you
might be able to work out how they

171
00:13:30 --> 00:13:35
differed by studying
them biochemically.

172
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
And let me just sort of give you a
sense of how that would work so you

173
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
can see histidine or any of these
amino acids.  They're sort of

174
00:13:43 --> 00:13:47
complicated and they have to be
built up by a sequence of

175
00:13:47 --> 00:13:51
biochemical steps with one enzyme
catalyzing each step in the pathway.

176
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
And when people started out trying
to study that kind of thing they

177
00:13:55 --> 00:13:59
didn't know how it was made.
All they knew was what the end

178
00:13:59 --> 00:14:03
product was.
And furthermore it was more of a

179
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
biosynthetic challenge even then
trying to work out the steps of

180
00:14:07 --> 00:14:11
glycolysis because actually quite a
reasonable proportion of the protein

181
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
in any cell is devoted towards
making energy.

182
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
So, relatively speaking,
there's a fair amount of the protein.

183
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
Each of those proteins that are
enzymes that we learned about,

184
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
for example, in glycolysis in a cell,
if you crack a cell open they're

185
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
made in larger quantities.
However, all the biosynthetic

186
00:14:30 --> 00:14:34
enzymes, the things for making amino
acids, for making purines,

187
00:14:34 --> 00:14:38
pyrimidines, nucleotides or vitamins,
which are only needed tiny amounts,

188
00:14:38 --> 00:14:42
there are only little tiny bits of
those enzymes.

189
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
So trying to work out the
biosynthetic pathways for how those

190
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
things were made was much more
difficult.  And it was helped by

191
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
genetics in the following way.
I'm not going to go into any great

192
00:14:54 --> 00:14:58
detail, but if you imagine that
there's a pathway for making

193
00:14:58 --> 00:15:02
histidine.  We don't
know what it is.

194
00:15:02 --> 00:15:08
But we know that the end product is
histidine.  We could get mutants.

195
00:15:08 --> 00:15:14
His-minus mutants, which I've said
up there, have the property of

196
00:15:14 --> 00:15:20
growing only if you add histidine.
So if we had just a minimal glucose

197
00:15:20 --> 00:15:26
plate, just some salts with glucose
and we were to streak a wild type

198
00:15:26 --> 00:15:33
bacterium on it, it would
grow just fine.

199
00:15:33 --> 00:15:38
But if we had a his-minus mutant on
a minimal glucose plate and we

200
00:15:38 --> 00:15:43
streaked it out,
it couldn't grow because it couldn't

201
00:15:43 --> 00:15:48
make histidine.
If it couldn't make histidine it

202
00:15:48 --> 00:15:54
couldn't make proteins.
But if we take the same plate,

203
00:15:54 --> 00:15:59
minimal glucose plus some histidine,
now this same mutant will grow

204
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
fine.
And that's how we could tell that it

205
00:16:03 --> 00:16:07
was specifically broken in making
histidine.  So if you were to go

206
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
into a undergrad lab,
and I won't talk for the moment on

207
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
how you would isolate those
his-minus bacteria,

208
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
it's not hard, you can do it in an
undergrad lab,

209
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
you can make a whole lot of mutants
that were broken in making histidine.

210
00:16:20 --> 00:16:24
So one of the sort of things
biochemists could do was they didn't

211
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
know what the intermediates were,
but let's just say there's

212
00:16:27 --> 00:16:31
intermediate-1,
intermediate-2, intermediate-3,

213
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
intermediate-4 and intermediate-5.
And finally it goes to histidine.

214
00:16:35 --> 00:16:40
Well, if we break the gene that
makes that, what will happen in that

215
00:16:40 --> 00:16:45
pathway is the cell will make this
intermediate, this intermediate,

216
00:16:45 --> 00:16:49
and then this one will kind of build
up.  And, furthermore,

217
00:16:49 --> 00:16:54
if I'm able to figure out what
intermediate-4 is,

218
00:16:54 --> 00:16:59
if I add intermediate-4 to this
mutant it will grow because the

219
00:16:59 --> 00:17:04
defect was earlier in the pathway.
And if I added intermediate-1 it

220
00:17:04 --> 00:17:09
won't grow.  And so by sort of using
very fine features of the phenotype,

221
00:17:09 --> 00:17:14
I mean getting in there, breaking it
open and discovering when

222
00:17:14 --> 00:17:19
intermediate was up,
or I could add an intermediate back

223
00:17:19 --> 00:17:24
and forth, sort of playing with the
phenotype you can learn a lot about

224
00:17:24 --> 00:17:29
the mutants that you've isolated and
so on.  But genetics as --

225
00:17:29 --> 00:17:32
And we'll sort of go into this just
a little bit more.

226
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
But genetics as a science is able
to figure out whether mutations are

227
00:17:36 --> 00:17:40
in the same genes and work out their
order without having to do any of

228
00:17:40 --> 00:17:44
these sort of specialized knowledge
of a phenotype.

229
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
It's a very general,
very powerful way of doing business.

230
00:17:47 --> 00:17:51
And I want to show you that.  I
want to use a system where we can

231
00:17:51 --> 00:17:55
see this very clearly.
And I want to introduce you to a

232
00:17:55 --> 00:17:59
bacterial virus.
The idea of a bacterial virus,

233
00:17:59 --> 00:18:03
which are called bacteriophage, but
it's just a bacterial virus.

234
00:18:03 --> 00:18:08
And what's a bacteriophage?
Well, it's got a protein coat of

235
00:18:08 --> 00:18:14
some kind.  They don't all look the
same, but just some of them look

236
00:18:14 --> 00:18:19
like this.  So this is protein and
this is DNA.  That's it genetic

237
00:18:19 --> 00:18:25
material.  And it's basically a
syringe.  It's got a coat and it's

238
00:18:25 --> 00:18:30
got stuff that will let it find a
bacterial host.

239
00:18:30 --> 00:18:36
And it's able to squirt its DNA
from the bacterium into the host.

240
00:18:36 --> 00:18:40
So if we take,
for example, an E.

241
00:18:40 --> 00:18:44
coli cell and this phage,
which I'm drawing not to scale,

242
00:18:44 --> 00:18:49
it would be smaller than this
relative to the bacterium.

243
00:18:49 --> 00:18:53
If it were to infect, it would
inject its DNA into the E.

244
00:18:53 --> 00:18:58
coli cell.  And what it's sort of
done is it's put a bunch of new

245
00:18:58 --> 00:19:02
genetic information into a cell
that's all capable of making

246
00:19:02 --> 00:19:07
RNA and proteins.
And so it kind of reprograms the

247
00:19:07 --> 00:19:12
cell in the way I'm going to show
you in a minute.

248
00:19:12 --> 00:19:17
So when this new DNA comes in,
this is the E. coli DNA.  And the

249
00:19:17 --> 00:19:22
virus kind of takes over the cell.
And what it does is it makes it

250
00:19:22 --> 00:19:27
into a machine or a factor for
making baby virus,

251
00:19:27 --> 00:19:32
if you will.  So first it makes
phage DNA.

252
00:19:32 --> 00:19:36
And then it also makes the proteins
that self-assemble to give [its code?

253
00:19:36 --> 00:19:41
.  So it's kind of reprogrammed the
cell.  And some of the viruses that

254
00:19:41 --> 00:19:45
infect our cells are essentially
doing the same thing.

255
00:19:45 --> 00:19:50
They stick their genetic material
into our cells and it takes over.

256
00:19:50 --> 00:19:55
So unlike the retrovirus that we
were talking about,

257
00:19:55 --> 00:20:00
this thing is not inserting its DNA
into the genome of the host.

258
00:20:00 --> 00:20:07
It's just using the cell as a
factory for making more of its own.

259
00:20:07 --> 00:20:15
So then these assemble so that the
host has now got phage inside it

260
00:20:15 --> 00:20:23
like this.  And the cells then lice,
which means that they burst open.

261
00:20:23 --> 00:20:31
The phage, once it's done all of
this, makes a special enzyme that

262
00:20:31 --> 00:20:38
degrades the bacterial cell wall.
And it makes the cell pop open.

263
00:20:38 --> 00:20:46
And it releases these free phage.
And if you start with one of them

264
00:20:46 --> 00:20:54
you might get,
for example, 150 coming out of the

265
00:20:54 --> 00:21:02
cell when it bursts.
And then each one of these is able

266
00:21:02 --> 00:21:10
to grab hold of another uninfected E.
coli and start the cycle again.

267
00:21:10 --> 00:21:14
And the cycle takes usually
something like 20 to 30 minutes for

268
00:21:14 --> 00:21:19
a bacteriophage.
So it's pretty quick.

269
00:21:19 --> 00:21:24
One phage absorbing to a bacterium,
injecting its DNA can make that 150

270
00:21:24 --> 00:21:29
copies of itself in about 20 minutes,
and then each of those can infect.

271
00:21:29 --> 00:21:34
So how would you detect something
like this?  Well,

272
00:21:34 --> 00:21:40
the trick that's done is pretty
simple.  You take something like ten

273
00:21:40 --> 00:21:45
to the eighth bacteria.
Let's say you have some bacteria in

274
00:21:45 --> 00:21:51
a test tube and then maybe let's say
ten to the two phage,

275
00:21:51 --> 00:21:57
and then you spread it on just a
Petri plate that the bacteria

276
00:21:57 --> 00:22:01
can grow on.
So there are many,

277
00:22:01 --> 00:22:05
many bacteria.  So they're just
going to sort of grow up and form

278
00:22:05 --> 00:22:09
kind of a wand that will cover the
whole plate.  And if you were to

279
00:22:09 --> 00:22:12
hold it up to the light you'd see
it's sort of opaque now because the

280
00:22:12 --> 00:22:16
bacteria have grown up.
But anywhere there was a phage to

281
00:22:16 --> 00:22:19
start out with,
a single phage it would infect its

282
00:22:19 --> 00:22:23
original cell,
the cell would burst open,

283
00:22:23 --> 00:22:27
it would release 150 phage,
they'd infect the nearest 150

284
00:22:27 --> 00:22:31
bacteria, they'd break open.
And so what happens is the bacteria

285
00:22:31 --> 00:22:36
trying to grow and cover the plate,
the phage are growing and eating all

286
00:22:36 --> 00:22:41
the bacteria.  Basically at least
using up all the bacteria in that

287
00:22:41 --> 00:22:46
area.  So what you get from this are
little holes in the “lawn”,

288
00:22:46 --> 00:22:51
and they're called a plaque.
That's the technical term.  Here.

289
00:22:51 --> 00:22:56
And so it's actually very easy to
see how many phage you have because

290
00:22:56 --> 00:23:01
you just put them out on a plate.
And I realize this might sound

291
00:23:01 --> 00:23:05
slightly fanciful.
There is a textbook picture of a

292
00:23:05 --> 00:23:09
bacteriophage with the DNAs all
packaged up in the head.

293
00:23:09 --> 00:23:13
It's got a sheath.  It's got little
things that will let it recognize a

294
00:23:13 --> 00:23:17
particular host.
And it really does look like a

295
00:23:17 --> 00:23:21
syringe.  And it's got stuff that
squirts, basically the mechanics to

296
00:23:21 --> 00:23:25
squirt the DNA in.
There's an electron micrograph.

297
00:23:25 --> 00:23:30
So that's a real one.  This is not
just a textbook cartoon.

298
00:23:30 --> 00:23:34
It's a pretty accurate depiction.
This was a little thing.  This is

299
00:23:34 --> 00:23:38
cycling, so don't get it mixed up.
This only happens once.  But this

300
00:23:38 --> 00:23:42
is basically depicting the idea that
the DNA starts out in the phage and

301
00:23:42 --> 00:23:47
then it gets injected into the cell.
And once it's in the cell the empty

302
00:23:47 --> 00:23:51
coat, it doesn't have anything else
to do in this story,

303
00:23:51 --> 00:23:55
but the DNA takes over.
And then you get, after a little

304
00:23:55 --> 00:24:00
while, when you've made these
progeny phage the cell breaks open.

305
00:24:00 --> 00:24:04
And if you assay them,
this is just a picture one of my

306
00:24:04 --> 00:24:08
post-docs made for me.
I think you can see here's a lawn.

307
00:24:08 --> 00:24:12
You can sort of see how it's opaque
and you can see those little holes.

308
00:24:12 --> 00:24:16
There were probably a thousand or
so phage that were put on this plate.

309
00:24:16 --> 00:24:21
There are several hundred anyway.
And you can just count the number

310
00:24:21 --> 00:24:25
of holes and then you know how many
phage you've got.

311
00:24:25 --> 00:24:29
OK?  So that's this system.
Now, what I'd like to now consider

312
00:24:29 --> 00:24:33
is how we could use genetics to try
and study the essential functions of

313
00:24:33 --> 00:24:38
that bacteriophage.
How does it replicate?

314
00:24:38 --> 00:24:42
How does it make its coat?
I want to study the things that are

315
00:24:42 --> 00:24:46
needed for it to be a phage,
not something that's dispensable.

316
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
I want to know essential functions.
So that means I would have to use

317
00:24:50 --> 00:24:54
conditional mutants of some type so
that I could study it because

318
00:24:54 --> 00:24:58
otherwise if I broke something that
was critical for the phage's life

319
00:24:58 --> 00:25:02
cycle I'd never get any phage and I
couldn't do any genetics.

320
00:25:02 --> 00:25:09
So what I would do is I would look
for temperature sensitive mutants.

321
00:25:09 --> 00:25:23
The phage.  So they'll form plaques,

322
00:25:23 --> 00:25:34
let's say plaques at 30 degrees.

323
00:25:34 --> 00:25:38
No plaques at 37 degrees.
And you go through, and you could

324
00:25:38 --> 00:25:43
be laborious or cleaver depending on
how you set this up.

325
00:25:43 --> 00:25:47
But we could make a bunch of
mutants.  And let's call T1,

326
00:25:47 --> 00:25:52
T2, just give them names like that
as I isolate them.

327
00:25:52 --> 00:25:56
Now, what I want to show you are
two absolutely standard and critical

328
00:25:56 --> 00:26:01
genetic ways of analyzing
these mutants.

329
00:26:01 --> 00:26:05
They all look the same.
Their phenotype is they form

330
00:26:05 --> 00:26:09
plaques at 30 degrees.
They don't form plaques at 37

331
00:26:09 --> 00:26:13
degrees.  They could be affecting
one gene.  We could have mutants in

332
00:26:13 --> 00:26:18
50 genes.  I don't know starting out.
All I know is I've got mutants that

333
00:26:18 --> 00:26:22
are temperature sensitive.
So genetics gives you a couple of

334
00:26:22 --> 00:26:26
ways of going at that that will tell
you not only are they in the same

335
00:26:26 --> 00:26:31
gene or in the different gene.
But it also will tell you something

336
00:26:31 --> 00:26:36
about their physical relationship
along the DNA.

337
00:26:36 --> 00:26:42
And this is without knowing
anything about what they do.

338
00:26:42 --> 00:26:47
So let me show you how that works.
So the first genetic operation is

339
00:26:47 --> 00:27:00
called a complementation test.

340
00:27:00 --> 00:27:03
And the thing that I hope will
strike you about particularly these

341
00:27:03 --> 00:27:06
bacteriophage things is these are so
simple.  I've already told you

342
00:27:06 --> 00:27:09
basically all the techniques we're
going to be using.

343
00:27:09 --> 00:27:12
We're going to be taking phage,
we're going to be mixing it with

344
00:27:12 --> 00:27:15
bacteria, we're going to be putting
them on a plate and we're going to

345
00:27:15 --> 00:27:18
be counting plaques.
But we're not going to do anything

346
00:27:18 --> 00:27:21
else and we're going to learn stuff
about whether mutations are in the

347
00:27:21 --> 00:27:24
same gene or different genes,
between different mutants and

348
00:27:24 --> 00:27:28
something about the order of the
genes on the chromosome.

349
00:27:28 --> 00:27:34
And that's the point I'm trying to
drive home right now.

350
00:27:34 --> 00:27:41
So here's the first idea.
Let's add the T1 mutant plus the T2

351
00:27:41 --> 00:27:48
mutant to some bacteria.
So we'll put them both into the

352
00:27:48 --> 00:27:55
same test tube.
And what we want is enough phage --

353
00:27:55 --> 00:28:06
So every bacterium gets both.

354
00:28:06 --> 00:28:12
So we want to take, if we take T1
by itself it will grow plagues at 30

355
00:28:12 --> 00:28:19
degrees, not at 37.
T2 plaques at 30 degrees,

356
00:28:19 --> 00:28:25
no plaques at 37.  Now we're going
to take some bacteria and put enough

357
00:28:25 --> 00:28:32
that both of them will get
into the same thing.

358
00:28:32 --> 00:28:37
Now, of course,
those bacteria are doomed because if

359
00:28:37 --> 00:28:42
anything happens,
because they've got things inside

360
00:28:42 --> 00:28:47
them.  So what we do now is then we
add a whole bunch of what we would

361
00:28:47 --> 00:28:52
call indicator bacteria.
These are ones that haven't been.

362
00:28:52 --> 00:28:57
And we'll put lots of those in, and
we'll put many fewer of these and

363
00:28:57 --> 00:29:02
we'll mix these together.
And then we'll plate them out under

364
00:29:02 --> 00:29:06
two different conditions.
Let's try it at 30 degrees.

365
00:29:06 --> 00:29:10
Well, in that case, I think we can
figure out what would happen.

366
00:29:10 --> 00:29:14
Both T1 and T2 can form plaque,
so you'd expect to see plaques.  And

367
00:29:14 --> 00:29:18
you would indeed see that if you did
this experiment.

368
00:29:18 --> 00:29:22
Now, the other thing,
though, this is where it gets

369
00:29:22 --> 00:29:26
interesting, is what would happen if
we plated them at 37 degrees?

370
00:29:26 --> 00:29:32
Well, on their own neither of them
can form a plaque.

371
00:29:32 --> 00:29:38
But we've engineered it so that
there are two within each bacterium.

372
00:29:38 --> 00:29:44
So there are two possible outcomes,
and let's think what they could be.

373
00:29:44 --> 00:29:50
We could either have mutations in
the same gene that some particular

374
00:29:50 --> 00:29:56
gene, let's say a gene required for
making the major protein in the coat,

375
00:29:56 --> 00:30:02
that mutant one is affected in that
gene and mutant two is affected in

376
00:30:02 --> 00:30:08
the same protein.
So both of them got a broken coat

377
00:30:08 --> 00:30:12
protein.  And so inside this
bacterium, when the phage are trying

378
00:30:12 --> 00:30:17
to grow, what you've got is this one
gene.  And this is the T1 mutant and

379
00:30:17 --> 00:30:21
this is the T2 mutant.
And maybe this one has got a

380
00:30:21 --> 00:30:26
mutation somewhere and the other one
has got it somewhere else in the

381
00:30:26 --> 00:30:31
gene, but this gene
is not functional.

382
00:30:31 --> 00:30:35
So we wouldn't get any plaques.
But what if they were in different

383
00:30:35 --> 00:30:47
genes?

384
00:30:47 --> 00:30:52
Let's say one of the mutants was
altered in the gene for a coat

385
00:30:52 --> 00:30:57
protein and the other one was
altered in a gene that was necessary

386
00:30:57 --> 00:31:02
for replicating the phage DNA.
So it's a situation like this.

387
00:31:02 --> 00:31:08
And let's say this is gene A and
that's gene B.

388
00:31:08 --> 00:31:14
What do you think could happen now?
Get plaques?  Wouldn't get plaques?

389
00:31:14 --> 00:31:19
Yeah?  I see a lot of nodding.
We'd get plaques because this one

390
00:31:19 --> 00:31:25
has a good gene A,
so it would make let's say the coat

391
00:31:25 --> 00:31:31
protein.  This one has a good gene B
so it could make the DNA polymerase

392
00:31:31 --> 00:31:36
for copying the phage DNA.
And things would be fine.

393
00:31:36 --> 00:31:41
And so by this very, very simple
test, we could take a whole lot of

394
00:31:41 --> 00:31:45
TS mutants and we could go through
in a pare-wise fashion,

395
00:31:45 --> 00:31:50
and we could say oh, I see,
number one, number seven and number

396
00:31:50 --> 00:31:55
54 apparently affect all mutations
affecting one gene,

397
00:31:55 --> 00:32:00
and we could put them into
categories by doing this.

398
00:32:00 --> 00:32:04
And we haven't done anything other
than mix phage and bacteria and look

399
00:32:04 --> 00:32:08
to see whether they're plaques or
not.  I mean this is very different

400
00:32:08 --> 00:32:13
than what a biochemist does.
It's a different kind of thinking.

401
00:32:13 --> 00:32:17
And yet it's enormously powerful.
So this procedure,

402
00:32:17 --> 00:32:22
which is one of the workhorses of a
geneticist, is known as a

403
00:32:22 --> 00:32:26
complementation test.
And depending on the organism it

404
00:32:26 --> 00:32:31
takes a whole bunch of different
sort of technical forms.

405
00:32:31 --> 00:32:36
But that's the principle of the
thing, that if you have one good

406
00:32:36 --> 00:32:41
copy of the gene and a broken one
then you can survive in most cases

407
00:32:41 --> 00:32:46
because usually the one will be
enough to get you through here.

408
00:32:46 --> 00:32:51
So that's one of the things that
geneticists do.

409
00:32:51 --> 00:32:56
And see how powerful it is for
something that's a very

410
00:32:56 --> 00:33:02
simple manipulation.
But let me now tell you the other

411
00:33:02 --> 00:33:08
kind of test that geneticists do.
It's a slightly different principle

412
00:33:08 --> 00:33:15
but just as powerful and gives you a
different kind of information.

413
00:33:15 --> 00:33:22
This is known as a recombination
test.  So what we're going to do in

414
00:33:22 --> 00:33:28
this case now is we're going to
allow two mutants to grow together

415
00:33:28 --> 00:33:36
in the same cell.
Let's say two mutants.

416
00:33:36 --> 00:33:45
And we'll use T1 and T2 again to
grow together in the same cell.

417
00:33:45 --> 00:33:53
Now, for example, remember up here
we mixed both of them in this so

418
00:33:53 --> 00:34:02
they both were inside this bacteria
and then when we plated it up,

419
00:34:02 --> 00:34:09
up here at 30 degrees we got plaques?
We would have gotten plaques from

420
00:34:09 --> 00:34:14
every single infected bacteria.
Well, those plaques probably have

421
00:34:14 --> 00:34:19
ten to the ninth phage in them.
And those were phage that grew

422
00:34:19 --> 00:34:24
together under permissive conditions.
OK?  So let's take those,

423
00:34:24 --> 00:34:33
re-suspend them --

424
00:34:33 --> 00:34:38
-- and bring them over here.
Now, we'll add them to some

425
00:34:38 --> 00:34:43
bacteria.  So bacteria in here.
But we're going to do it under

426
00:34:43 --> 00:34:48
different conditions now.
We don't want complementation

427
00:34:48 --> 00:34:54
taking place, so we'll make sure
that we have less than one phage --

428
00:34:54 --> 00:35:03
-- per bacterium.

429
00:35:03 --> 00:35:09
So we cannot do this
complementation thing anymore.

430
00:35:09 --> 00:35:16
We just got rid of it by using a
different ratio of phage to the

431
00:35:16 --> 00:35:23
bacteria.  So now what I want to do,
I'm going to plate this out at 37

432
00:35:23 --> 00:35:30
degrees.  We could add an indicator
if we wanted again.

433
00:35:30 --> 00:35:37
Well, that may seem like a stupid

434
00:35:37 --> 00:35:42
experiment in the sense that T1
wouldn't grow by itself and T2

435
00:35:42 --> 00:35:47
wouldn't grow by itself at 37
degrees.  And all I've done is let

436
00:35:47 --> 00:35:52
them grow together.
So if all we had in that population

437
00:35:52 --> 00:35:57
was what we started with there
wouldn't be any plaques.

438
00:35:57 --> 00:36:02
But if you do that what you will
find is you'll find

439
00:36:02 --> 00:36:12
some rare plaques.

440
00:36:12 --> 00:36:18
And these are what are known as
recombinants.  And let me now just

441
00:36:18 --> 00:36:24
give you a sense of how these
recombinants arise.

442
00:36:24 --> 00:36:30
So let's imagine that this is the
mutation and here's

443
00:36:30 --> 00:36:35
our T1 bacterium.
Here's its DNA.

444
00:36:35 --> 00:36:41
And let's say there's a function
here that it's wild type for and

445
00:36:41 --> 00:36:47
it's got a mutation down here.
The other one, T2 has got the

446
00:36:47 --> 00:36:53
mutation here but it's wild type for
there.  That's the kind of thing we

447
00:36:53 --> 00:36:59
were talking about,
a gene A and a gene B,

448
00:36:59 --> 00:37:04
although it's more general than that.
But what happens when these things

449
00:37:04 --> 00:37:10
are growing together is under rare
circumstances this interesting thing

450
00:37:10 --> 00:37:15
happens.  Since this is the two
strands of DNA and since these

451
00:37:15 --> 00:37:21
phages are almost identical and this
piece of DNA is the same as that

452
00:37:21 --> 00:37:26
piece of DNA.  And if a break every
happened in one of these strands,

453
00:37:26 --> 00:37:32
what can happen is it can invade the
other strand and displace it.

454
00:37:32 --> 00:37:38
And this strand can do a little
switcheroo and come over here like

455
00:37:38 --> 00:37:45
this.  So now we've got the plus and
the plus and the minus and the minus.

456
00:37:45 --> 00:37:52
So this is an intermediate but
these things happen.

457
00:37:52 --> 00:37:59
You get little breaks in DNA from
DNA damage and other things.

458
00:37:59 --> 00:38:02
And the other piece of DNA can go
off and pioneer and find another

459
00:38:02 --> 00:38:06
molecule.  And then there are
enzymes that resolve this.

460
00:38:06 --> 00:38:09
And if we cut it right here,
we'd just go back to what we had

461
00:38:09 --> 00:38:13
before.  But if you cut this strand
here, and you may have to sit down

462
00:38:13 --> 00:38:16
and draw this out because this,
for me, was not intuitive when I was

463
00:38:16 --> 00:38:20
learning this thing.
You'll see what happens now.

464
00:38:20 --> 00:38:23
The end of this strand will go over
and join to there.

465
00:38:23 --> 00:38:27
The end of this strand will join
and go here.

466
00:38:27 --> 00:38:32
And what you will get out of that is
one phage that's got both of the

467
00:38:32 --> 00:38:38
pluses and one of the phage that's
got both of the minuses.

468
00:38:38 --> 00:38:43
And I'll call this sort of T1,
T2 to indicate that it has got both

469
00:38:43 --> 00:38:49
of the mutations.
So this would be what we could

470
00:38:49 --> 00:38:55
detect over there.
That would be one of the rare wild

471
00:38:55 --> 00:39:00
types.
And I'll assert to you that this guy

472
00:39:00 --> 00:39:06
here has two mutations in
it instead of one.

473
00:39:06 --> 00:39:13
What's the phenotype of the one that

474
00:39:13 --> 00:39:17
has both mutations?
It cannot grow.  It can make

475
00:39:17 --> 00:39:21
plaques at 30 degrees.
It cannot make plaques at 37.

476
00:39:21 --> 00:39:25
If I got up and said I'm sure this
phage has two mutations.

477
00:39:25 --> 00:39:29
It has both T1 and T2 mutations in
it.

478
00:39:29 --> 00:39:33
And I say prove it to me.
Anybody see how you could do it

479
00:39:33 --> 00:39:40
given what I've already told you?

480
00:39:40 --> 00:39:44
Exactly.  If I tried it in a
complementation test with T1 it

481
00:39:44 --> 00:39:48
wouldn't compliment because both
would be broken in T1.

482
00:39:48 --> 00:39:52
If I tried to complement T2 it
wouldn't work because it's broken in

483
00:39:52 --> 00:39:56
T2.  And just by using these tiny
little simple manipulations that

484
00:39:56 --> 00:40:00
I've told you,
I can even see that something that

485
00:40:00 --> 00:40:05
has got a double mutant we could
sort it out at the bench.

486
00:40:05 --> 00:40:09
You could walk in and tell me the
next morning what the result was.

487
00:40:09 --> 00:40:13
In fact, phage grows so fast you
might even be able to do it in the

488
00:40:13 --> 00:40:17
morning and tell me before you went
home at night.

489
00:40:17 --> 00:40:21
So this is, as I say,
called a recombination test.

490
00:40:21 --> 00:40:25
And it's giving you a different
kind of information,

491
00:40:25 --> 00:40:29
but it's an extraordinarily powerful
technique for another reason,

492
00:40:29 --> 00:40:33
is that the recombination frequency
can be measured.

493
00:40:33 --> 00:40:41
We'll call RF.

494
00:40:41 --> 00:40:45
And this is the recombinants over
the total.  So,

495
00:40:45 --> 00:40:49
in our case, this would be the
number of wild type,

496
00:40:49 --> 00:40:53
plus the number of these double
mutants over the total of T1 plus

497
00:40:53 --> 00:40:57
the total of T2,
which would be the dominant members

498
00:40:57 --> 00:41:03
of this population.
Because this is a relatively rare

499
00:41:03 --> 00:41:10
event, plus the wild type,
plus the T1, T2.  And the thing that

500
00:41:10 --> 00:41:17
is so useful is the probability of,
geneticists call this a crossover,

501
00:41:17 --> 00:41:24
this kind of crossover happening is
proportional to the distance between

502
00:41:24 --> 00:41:30
these things.
If they're a very long distance

503
00:41:30 --> 00:41:34
apart there's a lot of DNA,
and the chances of it happening are

504
00:41:34 --> 00:41:38
much higher than if the two
mutations are very close together.

505
00:41:38 --> 00:41:42
It makes sense just from First
Principles.  So the recombination

506
00:41:42 --> 00:41:52
frequency varies as the distance --

507
00:41:52 --> 00:41:58
-- between the mutations.
So let's imagine that I do a cross

508
00:41:58 --> 00:42:05
like this.
We'd grow T1 plus T2 and we measure

509
00:42:05 --> 00:42:11
the recombination frequency,
and I find that it's 4%.  4% of the

510
00:42:11 --> 00:42:17
plaques are mutants out of
everything that's in there.

511
00:42:17 --> 00:42:23
And let me try another one.
I'll take T2 and I'll cross it with

512
00:42:23 --> 00:42:29
the next mutant phage of isolated T3.
And let's say,

513
00:42:29 --> 00:42:35
in this case, the recombination
frequency is 5%.

514
00:42:35 --> 00:42:40
Because I know they're different
distances, but if you think about it

515
00:42:40 --> 00:42:45
you'll realize there are two kinds
of maps we can draw.

516
00:42:45 --> 00:42:50
These data are compatible with the
gene order being one,

517
00:42:50 --> 00:42:55
two, with this being a distance that
corresponds to a 4% recombination

518
00:42:55 --> 00:43:00
frequency, and three with this being
the distance that corresponds

519
00:43:00 --> 00:43:05
to the 5%.
But it's also compatible,

520
00:43:05 --> 00:43:11
isn't it, with this where we have
one, two and three here.

521
00:43:11 --> 00:43:17
There's the 4%.  And from there to
there is the 5%.

522
00:43:17 --> 00:43:23
Yeah, that's right.
Two to three.  One to two is 4% and

523
00:43:23 --> 00:43:29
two to three is 5%
in both of these.

524
00:43:29 --> 00:43:36
One to two is 4%.
What did I do wrong?

525
00:43:36 --> 00:43:43
Two.  I guess I've got to do it
this way, two,

526
00:43:43 --> 00:43:51
one.  Is that going to do it?
What did I do with my example here?

527
00:43:51 --> 00:44:00
Yeah.  Hang on a second.  OK.

528
00:44:00 --> 00:44:04
Let's go back to where I was and see
if I can reconstruct this.

529
00:44:04 --> 00:44:08
OK.  There's one, and two is 4%,
and we want two to three 5%.  OK,

530
00:44:08 --> 00:44:13
right.  So it's going to be here.
Here we go.  Two to three.  Excuse

531
00:44:13 --> 00:44:17
me.  It's got to be farther over
here.  There's three.

532
00:44:17 --> 00:44:25
There's the 5%.

533
00:44:25 --> 00:44:32
OK.  Now we've got it,
once I change these numbers.

534
00:44:32 --> 00:44:38
The 4%, the 5%,
the 4%, the 5%.  OK.

535
00:44:38 --> 00:44:44
I thought I was over this cold.
I guess I'm not quite over this

536
00:44:44 --> 00:44:50
cold.  OK.  Could you devise an
experiment that would distinguish

537
00:44:50 --> 00:44:56
between those maps?
Yeah?  Yeah.  You've got it.

538
00:44:56 --> 00:45:02
Take T1 and T3.
One of those you'll get a 9%.

539
00:45:02 --> 00:45:08
One of them you'll get a 1%.  Isn't
that amazing?  I mean it's so simple,

540
00:45:08 --> 00:45:14
but I think you can perhaps see some
of the power of genetics here.

541
00:45:14 --> 00:45:19
All we've done is we've got things
that we know can form plaques at 30

542
00:45:19 --> 00:45:25
and not at 37.
We haven't done anything other than

543
00:45:25 --> 00:45:31
mix them with bacteria and
then count plaques.

544
00:45:31 --> 00:45:35
And we've been able to make
inferences in a living organism

545
00:45:35 --> 00:45:39
about mutations in genes that are
absolutely essential for that

546
00:45:39 --> 00:45:44
organism to grow.
So what phage geneticists were able

547
00:45:44 --> 00:45:48
to do over the years then was they
would make a map of all of these

548
00:45:48 --> 00:45:53
different genes down to the phage
genome and then the biochemist would

549
00:45:53 --> 00:45:57
go in and work it out.
And people studying mice would make

550
00:45:57 --> 00:46:02
maps of genes along mice.
And it's only been in the last

551
00:46:02 --> 00:46:06
handful of years we've been able to
go in and sequence the DNA and find

552
00:46:06 --> 00:46:11
out where all of these things are.
So I will see you guys after.  I

553
00:46:11 --> 00:46:15
hope you have a wonderful spring
break.  And I think you'll really

554
00:46:15 --> 00:46:20
enjoy hearing Penny.
And we'll start in on diploid

555
00:46:20 --> 00:46:24
genetics and Mendel and stuff as
soon as we get back.

556
00:46:24 --> 00:46:27
OK?  So see you in a little bit.
