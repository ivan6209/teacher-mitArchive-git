8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript – Lecture 7 

So far in these lectures we've talked about mass, about acceleration and about 
forces, but we never used the word "weight," and weight is a very nonintuitive and a 
very tricky thing which is the entire subject of today's lecture. 

What is weight? Here you stand on a bathroom sca le.


Gravity is acting upon you, the force is mg, your mass is m.


The bathroom sca le  is pushing on you with a force F sca le and that F scale--


which in this case if the system is not being accelerated is the same as mg--


that force from the bathroom scale on you we define as weight.


When I stand on the bathroom scale I could see my weight is about 165 pounds.


Now, it may be calibrated in newtons but that's, of course, very unusua l.


If I weigh myself on the moon where the gravitational acceleration is six times less

then I would weigh six times less--


so far, so good.


Now I'm going to put you in an elevator and I'm going to accelerate you upwards

and you're stand ing on your bathroom sca le.


Acceleration is in this direction and I will ca ll this "p lus" and I will call this "minus."

Gravity is acting upon you, mg and the bathroom scale is pushing on you w ith a

force F.


That force, by definition, is weight.


Before I write down some equations, I want you to realize that whenever, whenever

you see in any of my equations "g" g is always p lus 9.8.


And my signs, my minus signs take care of the directions but g is a lways plus 9.8 or

plus 10, if you prefer that.


Okay, it's clear that if this is accelerated upwards that F of s must be larger than mg;

otherwise I cannot be accelerated.


And so we get Newton's Second Law: F of s is in plus direction...


minus mg--


it's in this d irection--


equa ls m  times a and so the bathroom scale indicates m times a plus g.


And I have ga ined weight.


If this acceleration is five meters per second squared in this d irection I am one and a

half times my norma l weight.


If I look on the bathroom scale, that's what I see.


Seeing is believing--


that is my weight.


If I accelerate upwards, with 30 meters per second squared 30 plus 10 is 40--


I am four times my norma l weight.


Instead of my 165 pounds, I would weigh close to 700 pounds.


I see that--


seeing is believing.


That  is my weight.


Now I am going to put you in the elevator--


here you are--


and I'm going to accelerate you down.


This is now a.


And just for my convenience I call this now the plus direction just for my

convenience--


it doesn't rea lly matter.


So now we have here mg--


that is gravity acting upon you.


And now you have the force from the bathroom sca le.


Clearly, mg must be larger than F of s;


otherwise you couldn't go being accelerated downwards.


So if now we write down Newton's Second Law then we get mg minus F of s must be

m times a.


This holds for acceleration down and so I get F of s equals m times g minus a.


This is one way of doing it and you put in positive va lues for a.


If a is five meters per second squared you get ten minus five is five--


your weight is half.


You've lost weight.


Being accelerated down, you've lost weight.


You could a lso have used this equation and not go through this troub le of setting up

Newton's Law again.


You could simply have said "Okay, this a is minus in this coord inate system" and so

you put in a minus five and a p lus ten--


you get the same answer.


So you have lost weight when you accelerate downwards.


Suppose now I cut the cable...


cut  it.


Then this a  is ten meters per second squared if we round it off.


You go down w ith ten meters per second squared so g minus a is zero.


You are now weightless, you are free-falling.


You have no longer any weight.


You look at the bathroom sca le and the bathroom scale will ind icate zero.


You're floating, everything in the elevator is floating.


If you had a g lass with water you could turn it over and the water would not fall out.


It's like having the shuttle in orbit w ith the astronauts being weightless.


There  is a great similarity between the astronauts in the shuttle and a free-falling

elevator.


The only difference is that the elevator w ill crash, w ill kill you.


In the case of the shuttle it never hits the earth because of its high speed.


We'll ta lk about this much later when we dea l with orb its and with Kep ler's Law.


What exactly is free fa ll? Free fall is when the forces acting upon you are exclusively

gravitational.


Nothing is pushing on you; no seat is pushing on you, no string is pushing on you.


Nothing is pulling on you, only gravity.


I w ill return to this weightlessness very shortly  in great detail but before I do that, I

would like to address the issue--


how could I determine your weight if I hang you from a string? So now, instead of 
standing on a bathroom scale you are here. 

Here is a string.


You might even have in the string a tension meter as we have seen earlier in

lectures.


And you are holding desperately onto  that string.


Just  like that.


The system is not being accelerated, gravity is mg and so there must be tension in

the string, T which is pulling you up which, if there is no acceleration, must be mg.


I read the sca le and I read my weight.


This sca le  indicates, in my case, 165 pounds.


While I'm hanging, I can see my weight.


So you see, it makes very little d ifference whether I am stand ing on a bathroom

sca le and read the force with which the bathroom scale pushes up on me or whether

I hang from a scale extend a spring and read that value.


It makes no d ifference.


The tension here would indicate my weight.


There  is a complete similarity with the bathroom sca le except in one case, something

is pulling on me;


in the other case, something is pushing on me from below.


Now let's accelerate this system upwards w ith an acceleration a--


and I call this plus.


Then, of course, this T must grow; otherwise you cannot be accelerated.


Newton's Second Law, T minus mg must be ma.


The tension in the string equals m times a plus g.


Ah! We've seen that before.


No difference with the elevator.


You accelerate the system, the tension w ill increase and you w ill see that, you w ill

read that on the scale.


Your weight has increased, you weigh more.


Needless to say, of course, if you accelerate the system down that you will weigh

less--


we just went through that argument.


And if I cut the cab le completely you go into  free fa ll.


T w ill go to zero, a become minus ten plus ten is zero.


You're in free fall.


The scale reads zero, you are completely weightless.


If we accept the idea of weight being indicated by the tension in a string then there

is a very interesting consequence of that.


I have here a pin which is completely frictionless and I have on both sides a string

and this string has negligibly small mass.


Now, just assume that it is massless.


And there is here an object m1 and there is here an object m2 and I am telling you

that m2 is larger than m1.


So we all know what's going to happen.


The system is going to accelerate in this direction.


M2 w ill be accelerated down and m1 will be accelerated up.


What comes now is important, that you grasp that.


I cla im that the tension on the left side must be the same as the tension in this

string on the right side.


T Left must be T R ight.


Why is that? It is because the pin is frictionless and it is because the string is

massless.


Take a little section of the string here a teeny-weeny little section.


If there is a  tension on it--


that is, a force in this d irection and there is a force in this d irection--

these two could never be different because then this massless string would get an 
infinite acceleration. 

So there can never be a change in tension from this side of the string to the other. 

If you take a little section of the string here--

there it is, teeny-weeny little section so there  is tension on the string and there is 
tension on the string--

this one could never be larger than that because this little piece of string would get 
an infinite acceleration. 

So because there is no friction on the pin and because the strings are massless--

only because of that must the tension be everywhere the same. 

If there is friction in the pin--

which we w ill do  later--

then that's not the case. 

Given the fact that the tension left and the tension right are the same I must now 
conclude that these two objects have the same weight because didn't we agree that 
tension is an indication of weight? So these ob jects have now the same weight. 

And some peop le may say "Oh, that's a lot of nonsense, you must be kidding.


"If m2 is larger than m1 this must have a larger weight than that." Well, they are

confusing weight w ith mass.


It is true that m2 is a larger mass than m1 but it is equally true that the weight of

these two ob jects  is now the same according to my definition of weight.


Let us calculate the acceleration of this system and let's calculate the tension and

let's see what comes out.


I first isolate here ob ject number one.


This is my object number one.


I have gravity, m1 g, and I have a  tension T.


Nonnegotiable.


T better be larger than m1 g.


Otherw ise it would never be accelerated up and we know it w ill be accelerated up.


So what do we get? We get T--


I w ill call this plus d irection, by the way--


minus m1 g equa ls m times a.


So the tension equals m1 times a p lus g.


Hey! We've seen that one before.


This one is being accelerated upwards.


Notice it gains weight.


That's the tension and this is the acceleration.


I have one equation w ith two unknowns so I can't solve it yet.


But there is another one, there is number two here.


For number two, we have a force, m2 g and we have the tension up.


This one better be larger than that one; otherw ise it wouldn't be accelerated down.


Let me call this direction plus.


The reason why I now sw itch directions and call this plus--


as well as this--


is a good reason for it.


It's not so arbitrary anymore.


I know that this acceleration  is going to be a positive number.


Because it's going in this direction, it's a given.


If I called this negative, I would get here a negative acceleration for the same thing

for which I get here a positive.


That's a pain  in the neck.


I don't want to have a plus and a minus sign there, have to think about that it means

the same thing.


So the moment that I decide to define this the p lus d irection I know that this

acceleration will a lso come out to be the same sign as this one.


So I flip the signs there.


So now I apply Newton's Law.


I get m2 g minus T equals m2 a.


And so I get T--


I'll write it here--


equa ls m2 times g minus a.


Two equations with two unknowns.


Well, that shouldn't be so hard to solve these two equations.


You can immediately eliminate T, by the way.


If you add this one w ith this one, you rea lly--


I call this equation one, you ca ll this equation two--


you immed iately lose your T and you get that the acceleration, a equals m2 minus

m1 divided by m1 p lus m2 times g.


And you substitute that "a" in that equation and you'll find that the tension equals

2mg divided by m1 p lus m2.


This is very easy for you to verify.


Let us look.


This is m1, m2...


2m1, m2--


I lost one m--


2m1, m2.


Let's look at these equations, let's scrutinize them a little.


Let's get some feeling  for it rather than accepting them as being dumb equations.


Let's first take the case that m2 equals m1, and I'll call that "m." Notice that a

becomes zero and notice, if you substitute for m1 and m2 "m" here that you get 2m,

you get mg.


So T becomes mg.


That  is utterly obvious.


If m1 and m2 are the same, nothing is going to happen.


They're going to sit there, acceleration will be zero and the tension on both sides--


which is a lways the same, we argued that--


is going to be mg.


Clear.


Now we're going to make it more interesting.


Suppose we make m2 much, much larger than m1 and in a limiting case we even go

with m1 to zero.


Let's do that.


What you see now,  if m1 goes to zero this goes away, this goes away, a goes to g

and T goes to zero.


If m1 is zero, T goes to zero.


That  is obvious! Because if I make m1 zero, m2 goes into free fall.


And if m2 goes into free fall its weight is zero and so the tension is zero--


that's exactly what you see--


and you see that the acceleration of that object  is g, which  it better be, because  it's

in free fall.


So you see, this makes sense.


This is exactly consistent with your intuition.


And if you wanted to make m1 much, much larger than m2 and you take the limiting

case for m2 goes to zero you'll find aga in that a goes to g and that T goes to zero

except that now the acceleration is not this way...


[makes whooshing sound]


but now the acceleration is this way and now this object will go into free fall.


And therefore there is no tension in the string anymore.


M1, if I return to the case which we have there--


that m2 is larger than m1--


m1 is being accelerated upwards.


That's nonnegotiab le, so it must have gained weight.


M2 is being accelerated down, so it must have  lost weight.


Just  like being in an elevator, there's no difference.


They each weigh the same--


one  loses weight, the other ga ins weight.


They each weigh the same, and so I can make the pred iction that if this is m2 g,

which was its original weight and this now is the new weight, T that m2 g must be

larger than T.


M1 ga ins weight, so T must be larger than m1 g.


M2 loses weight, so T must be smaller than m2 g.


That's my pred iction--


it has to be.


And we can... I can show you that w ith some easy numbers.


Let m1 be 1.1 kilograms and let m2 be 1.25 kilograms.


Frictionless system, and the string has a neg lig ible mass.


What is the acceleration "a" of the system? I get m2 minus m1--


that is 0.15 divided by the sum, which is 2.35 and that is approximately 0.064 g,

approximately 0.064 g.


It's about 1/16th of the gravitational acceleration.


It's a very modest acceleration.


What is the tension? Well, I substitute my numbers for m1 and m2 in there.


You can take, for g, 10, if you like that and you will find that the tension equa ls 1.17

g.


And now look at what I pred icted.


They both weigh 1.17 g,  that's nonnegotiab le.


That  is my definition of weight--


the tension in both sides is the same.


That's my definition of weight.


This is their weight.


This one had a weight 1.25 g w ithout being accelerated.


You see, it has lost weight, because it accelerated down.


This one had a weight of 1.1 g.


You see, it has ga ined weight, because it has accelerated up. 

So you see, the whole p icture ties together very neatly and it's important that you 
look at it that way. 

I now want to return to the idea of comp lete weightlessness and I want to remind 
you, a few lectures ago how I was sw ing ing you at the end of a string in the vertica l.


I was sw ing ing you like this.


And I was swinging a bucket of water like this.


And I want to return to that.


I want to look at you when you are at the bottom of your circle and when you are at

the very top of that circle.


You go around a circle which has radius R.


Here is that circle.


There's a string here, you're here.


And there's a string here and at some point in time, you're there.


And you're going around...


let's assume that you're going around with an angular velocity omega and for

simplicity, we keep omega constant.


But that's rea lly not that  important.


Okay, this is point P and this is point S.


Let's first look at the situation at point P.


You have a mass and so gravity acts upon you, mg.


There  is tension in the string, T.


There must be--


this is nonnegotiable--


a centripeta l acceleration upwards.


Otherw ise, you could never do this.


Remember,  from the uniform circular motion.


So there must be here centripeta l acceleration which is omega squared R or, if you

prefer, v squared d ivided by R if v is the speed,  tangential speed at that point.


It must be there.


Let's look here.


Right there, gravity is acting upon you, mg.


Let's assume this string is pulling on you.


Let's assume that for now, so  there is a tension.


The string is pulling on you.


Therefore, nonnegotiable, when you make this curvature here there must be a

centripetal acceleration and that centripetal acceleration must be omega squared R.


That  is nonnegotiab le, it has to be there.


Let's now evaluate first the situation at P and I will call this plus and I w ill call this

minus.


So what I get now is that T minus mg must be m times the centripetal acceleration

so T must be m times the centripetal acceleration plus g.


Hey! That looks very familiar.


It looks like someone is being accelerated in an elevator--


almost the same equation.


If the centripetal acceleration at this point for instance, were 10 meters per second

squared then you would weigh tw ice your normal weight.


The tension here would be twice mg.


If this were five meters per second squared then you would be 1Ω  times your

weight.


Let's now look at the situation at S.


At point S, I'm going to call this plus and that minus.


I'm going to  find that T plus mg must be m times the centripeta l acceleration--


Newton's Second Law.


So I find that the tension there equals m times a of c minus g.


Hey! Very similar to what I've seen before.


This object is losing weight.


Let us take the situation that a of c  is exactly 10 meters per second squared and we

discussed that last time when we had the bucket of water in our hands.


If a of c...


if the centripetal acceleration when it goes through the top is 10, then this is zero.


So the string has no tension, the string goes  limp and the bucket of water and you

are weightless. 
If the centripeta l acceleration is larger than 10 then, of course, the string w ill be 
tight.


There w ill be a force on you and whatever comes out of here w ill  indicate your

weight.


If a of c is sma ller than 10,  that's meaning less.


The tension can never be negative.


A string with negative tension has no physica l meaning.


What it means is that the bucket of water would never have made it to this point.


If you try to sw ing it up--


as someone tried in the second lecture--


but d idn't make it to that point the bucket of water will just fall.


You end up with a mess, but that's a detail.


So the bucket of water, when it is here...


If the acceleration there, the centripeta l acceleration were exactly 10 meters per

second squared then that bucket of water would be weightless.


So I sa id earlier that when you're in free fall a ll objects in free fall are weightless.


It's like a spacecraft in orbit or an elevator w ith a cut cable.


It also means that if I jump off the tab le that I'm weightless while I am in mid-air, so

to speak.


It means this tennis ball...


while it is in free fall, it has no weight.


Now it has weight.


Now the weight is even higher because I am accelerating it and now it has no

weight.


The tennis ba ll is weightless and I assume,  for now, that the a ir drag plays no role.


If I jump off the table I will be weightless for about ha lf a second.


This is about one meter.


If I jump from a tower which is 100 meters high I will be weightless for 4Ω  seconds

ignoring a ir drag.


I prefer today the ha lf a second.


I am going to jump off this tab le w ith this water in my hand.


And I'm going to tell you how I can convince you that as I jump, that I will, indeed,

be weightless.


Here is the bottle.


There  is a gravitationa l force on the bottle.


My hands are pushing up on this bottle.


My hands are being a bathroom sca le.


I feel, in my muscles, the need to push up.


In fact, I might even be ab le to estimate the weight p laying the role of a bathroom

sca le.


It's a ga llon of water, it's about nine pounds.


Now my own body...


gravity is acting upon me but I am being pushed up, right there.


Suppose we jumped.


There would be no pushing from me on the bottle anymore no pushing there on me,

the table.


Only gravitation would act upon us and we would be weightless.


How can I show you that we are weightless? Well, if I don't have to use my muscles

to push on this bottle upwards I might as well lower my hands a little b it during this

free fa ll.


And you w ill see that the bottle will just stay above my hands w ithout my having to

push up.


Therefore, being the bathroom scale I no longer have to push on it.


I no longer... my muscles don't feel anything and the bottle is therefore weightless.


The bottle is weightless when we jump; I am weightless and even this bagel is

weightless.


We're a ll weightless during ha lf a second.


There  is no such thing in physics as a free lunch.


You have to pay a price for this ha lf a second of weightlessness.


What happens when I hit the floor? I hit the floor with a velocity  in this direction

which is about five meters per second.


You can ca lculate that.


But a little later, I've come to a stop.


That means during the impact there must be an acceleration upwards.


Otherw ise my velocity in this direction could never become zero.


Therefore, I will weigh more during this impact--


there is an acceleration  in this direction.


The five meters per second goes to zero.


If I make the assumption that it takes two-tenths of a second--


that's a very rough guess, this impact time--


then the average acceleration w ill be five meters per second divided by 0.2;


that is 25 meters per second squared.


That means the acceleration upwards is 2Ω  g.


That means I w ill weigh 3Ω  times more.


Remember it is a plus g, so a is 2Ω  g up plus the g that we already have;


that makes it 3Ω  g.


So instead of weighing 165 pounds I weigh close to 600 pounds for two-tenths of a

second.


So we get four phases.


Right now, I'm my normal weight if I stand on a bathroom sca le.


I jump  for half a second, weightless hit the floor for about two-tenths of a second

maybe close to 600 pounds.


And then after that I will have my normal weight again.


Now, you're going to have only ha lf a second to see that this bottle, as I jump, is

floating above my hands.


I w ill pull my hands off so you will see that I no  longer have to push it.


That means it's weightless.


Are you ready? I'm ready.


Three, two, one, zero.


Did you see it floating above my hands? We were both weightless.


Now, I have been thinking about this for a long, long time.


I have been thinking whether perhaps this could not be shown in a more dramatic

way perhaps even a more convincing way.


And so I thought of the idea of putting a bathroom scale under my feet tying it very

loosely so that it wouldn't fall off when I jump and then show you that while I am

half a second in free fall that the bathroom sca le indeed ind icates zero.


And don't think that I haven't tried it.


I've tried it many times w ith many bathroom scales.


I made many jumps.


There  is a problem, and the prob lem is the bathroom scales that you buy--


that you normally get commercially--


they indeed want to go to zero.


It takes them a long time.


They have a lot of inertia, their response time  is slow.


But even if they make it to zero by the time you hit the floor then immediately the

weight increases because you hit the floor and your weight comes up by 3Ω  times.


So it begins to swing back and forth and it becomes comp letely chaotic and you can

no longer see what's happening.


And it just so happened that about six months ago, Dave...


I had d inner with Professor Dave Trumper and  I exp lained  it to him that it is just

unfortunate that you can never really show it that you jump off the table, have a

bathroom scale under you and see that weight go down to zero when you are in  free

fall. 

And he said, "Duck soup--

I can do that." He says, "I can make you a sca le "which has a  response time of 
maybe 10 milliseconds "so when you jump off the table in 10 milliseconds you w ill 
see that thing go down to zero." And he delivered, he came through. 

He built this wonderful device which he and I are going  to demonstrate to you. 

Let me first give you some reasonable light for this. 

And I would like to show you on the scale there what this scale that he built is

indicating.


Here is the scale, I have it in my hands.


And on top of this scale is a little platform just like on your scale.


This platform weighs 4Ω  pounds.


And you can see that,  it says about 4Ω.


Now, you w ill say "Hmm! I wouldn't want that kind of a bathroom scale.


"I mean, if I want to see my bathroom sca le "I want to see a zero before I want to

go up.


"I'm heavy enough all by myself.


I don't want to get another 4Ω  pounds." The manufacturer has simp ly zeroed that

sca le for you but obviously a lso your bathroom scale has a cover on it.


Once you have seen these demonstrations you will be ab le to answer for yourself

why we don't zero this why we rea lly leave this to be 4Ω.


That's the actual mass which is on top of the spring.


But it's not really a spring--


it is a pressure gauge, but think of it as a spring.


4Ω  pounds.


Here we have a weight which is a barbell weight, which is 10 pounds.


Is this from one of your children, Dave or were you doing it yourself? 10 pounds...


we put it on top here.


What do you see? Roughly 14Ω  pounds.


All right, we are going to tape it down.


There we go.


And we're going to drop it from about 1Ω, two meters and we drop it in here, well-

cushioned because we don't want to break this beautiful device.


When we drop it, the response is so  fast that you w ill see, indeed, that pointer go to

zero.


Now, keep in mind, when it hits the cushion that the weight will go up.


For now, I want you to concentrate only on the thing going to zero and not what

comes later.


We will dea l with that w ithin a minute.


Okay... 14Ω  pounds.


You know why the thing is actua lly jigg ling back and forth? I can't hold it exactly still

and so I slightly accelerate it upwards and downwards and when I accelerate it 
slightly upwards it weighs a little more and when I accelerate it downwards, it 
weighs less. 

It's interesting.


You can see I'm nervous.


That's my nervous tension meter there.


Okay, we're ready? Look and... don't look at me, now, look at that pointer.


Three, two, one, zero.


Did you see it go to zero? All the way to zero.


Now comes something even more remarkab le.


He sa id to me, "I can a lso make the students see the response on a time scale of

about a fraction of a second."  By the way, this is the hero who made all this stuff.


He's fantastic.


[class applauds]


LEWIN: He can show you the weight on an electronic scale and this weight you will

see as a  function of time.


I w ill put the ten pounds back on again...


tape it a little tighter and so the level that you see now is 14Ω  pounds.


This is 14Ω  pounds and this  is zero, this mark is zero.


I'm going to hold it in my hand.


And notice, if I can hold it still you're back to your 14Ω  pounds.


Now I'm going to drop it.


You will see it go down to zero.


It will hit the floor, the cushion.


It will get an acceleration upwards.


It will become way heavier than  it was before and then it will even be bounced back

up in the air and it goes aga in into  free fa ll.


We will freeze that for you, and you w ill be able...


we will be able to analyze  it, then, after it a ll happens.


So, 14Ω  pounds...


three, two, one, zero.


And now Professor Trumper is freezing it for you.


Now look at this, look at this incred ible picture.


This is truly an eye-opener for me, when I saw it.


The physics in here is unbelievab le.


Here is your 14Ω  pounds.


Tick marks from here to here are ha lf a second.


It was ha lf a second in free fa ll and it goes to zero, that's no weight.


Now it hits the floor, the cushion and its weight goes up in something like a tenth of

a second.


Look, this is about one, two,  three...


It's about 3Ω  times its weight now.


So the 14Ω  has to be multiplied by 3Ω  or four which is exactly what we pred icted--


that it would be much higher.


But now it's being...


it bounces off, because it's a very nice cushion.


It throws it back up.


So it goes back into the air so it goes  immed iately to weightlessness again and then

it oscillates back and  forth.


And then here you would expect that this level, 14Ω  pounds, would be the same as

this.


And the only reason why that's not the case is there's a little cab le that fell w ith it

which is pushing a little b it up on the upper... on the upper disc that  is there so it's

making it a little lighter.


Isn't it incred ible? You see here in front of you the weightlessness and you see the

extra weight when it hits and aga in followed by weightlessness.


Dave, A-plus, you passed the course.


There  is a great interest in doing experiments under weightless cond itions.


NASA was very interested in it.


And if you would jump 100 meters up in the sky you would only be nine seconds up.


You wouldn't even be weightless because of a ir drag.


However, if you could jump up way near the top of the atmosphere--


where the air drag is negligib le--


then you would be weightless for quite some time.


And that is what people have been doing for the past few decades.


Professor Young and Professor Oman here at the Aeronautics Department have done

what they ca ll "zero gravity experiments" from a irp lanes--


and I w ill expla in that in detail--


but first I want you to appreciate that "zero gravity" is a complete misnomer.


"Zero weight," yes--


"zero gravity," no.


If you have an a irplane anywhere near Earth, flying whether the eng ines are on or

whether the engines are off or whether it is free-falling doesn't matter.


There  is never zero gravity.


There  is always gravity--


thank goodness.


But if you are in free fall, indeed, there is no weight.


Apart from that, they call them "zero gravity experiments" and why not? Maybe it

sells better.


They fly an airplane, which is the KC-135 and they do these experiments at an

altitude of about 30,000  feet.


If I could clean this as best as I can...


The p lane comes in at one point  in time at an angle of about 45 degrees.


There's nothing specia l about that 45 degrees.


It's just...


that's the way it's done.


You have to also think of the convenience--


convenience for the passengers.


The speed is then about 425 miles per hour so the horizontal component  is about

300 miles per hour and the vertica l component is a lso 300.


The air drag is very little.


Let's assume,  for the sake of the argument that the eng ines are cut and the plane

goes into free fall.


It's no different from this tennis ba ll--


[makes whooshing sound]


the same thing.


You're going to see a parabola.


And so this plane is going to free-fa ll and comes back to this level.


And let's analyze this arc, this parabola.


Right here at the top, clearly there w ill still be 300 meters per second in the absence

of any a ir drag.


You should be ab le to calculate with all the tools that you have available how high

this goes from this level.


In other words, what is the time that the velocity in the y d irection comes to zero?

You can ca lculate that and then you know how much it has traveled.


Very crude number, this is about 900 meters.


And it will take about 15 seconds to reach this point so it w ill take about 30 seconds

to go from here to here and in those 30 seconds the horizontal displacement is about 
3Ω  kilometers. 

And a ll these numbers you should be able to confirm.


Right here, the engines are restarted.


During this free fall, everyone  in the airplane is weightless including the a irplane

itself.


Now the engines start, and the engine is sort of...


The p lane is going to pull up, it goes into this phase and then the plane flies

horizontally for a while.


During this phase, as we just d iscussed it's like hitting the floor.


You need an acceleration in this direction.


There w ill be weight increase so there is here an acceleration upwards.


And during this time, very roughly people have about tw ice their weight.


And then here, they have again norma l weight.


And then the p lane pulls up again and here it goes and repeats the whole thing aga in

going into free fa ll.


So aga in here, peop le have more than their normal weight.


Zero weight, more than normal weight normal weight, more than normal weight,

free fa ll.


And the whole cycle takes about 90 seconds.


You can imagine that it is very important when you are here in  free fa ll, when you

have no weight that when your weight comes back and your weight doubles--


and Professor Oman told me that this change from zero to twice your weight takes 
less than a second--

that you better know where your feet are and where your head is because if your 
head is down and you all of a sudden double your weight you crush your skull, so 
you have to be sure that you are standing stra ight up in the plane when your weight 
begins to double and we w ill see that very shortly, how that works. 

I want to show you  first some slides from these experiments. 

So here you see the situation that we just described. 

Let us start here, that is where I started with you. 

The p lane turns the eng ines off. 

This is the parabola. 

Here the engines are restarted.


This is the free-fa ll period.


This is about 30 seconds.


The engine is restarted, and during this time there is an acceleration upwards and

they call  it "2g peak." Well, they rea lly mean 1g.


What they rea lly mean, that my weight doubles.


They call that "2g" but, of course, they call this "0g" which is equally incorrect.


It's not 0g--


you have no weight. This is weightless, here your weight is double here your weight

is normal, here your weight roughly doubles and you go into another free-fall period

and the cycle from here to here is about 90 seconds.


Now, the irony has it that the reason why these flights are done is to study motion

sickness under weightless cond itions.


Astronauts were compla ining about motion sickness.


And so Professor Young and Oman have done lots and lots of experiments with

airp lanes and later, a lso, in the shuttle to study this motion sickness.


I find it rather ironic because if you and I were part of these experiments we would

get terribly sick because of the experiments.


Just  imagine that you go  from weightlessness into twice your weight, back to

weightlessness.


We would be puking a ll day! How can you study people who are sick? How can you

study the sickness due to weightlessness? Well, they must have found a way.


They do this about 50 times per day.


And now I want to show you some real data which were kind ly given to me by

Professor Young where you see them actually in the plane.


I believe I have to put this on one and start the...


Can you turn off the slide projector? &nbsp;


So here you see them in the p lane.


They are not weightless, they are climbing up.


I think this is Professor Young.


The guys lying on the floor must be a bit tired.


The light will shortly go on, and when the light goes on that's an ind ication that the

weightlessness is coming up.


It already went on, I must have missed it, I wasn't looking.


And there they go into weightlessness.


See, this person is upside down here.


You better get straight up before your weight doubles because you'll crash into the

floor.


[class  laughs]


LEWIN: And now it takes 60 seconds because the whole cycle is 90 seconds and in

these 60 seconds they get ready for the next free fa ll--


for the next weightlessness.


And you w ill see very shortly the light will go on again, and that w ill tell them that

the weightlessness is coming up and then they will be weightless for another 30

seconds.


The sound that you hear is obviously the engines of the p lane.


There you go--


light goes on,  they get a warning, they take their headphones off and everything

becomes weightless.


They may not like that and so they put their headphones  in a secure place.


You see that here Professor Young takes his off.


And there they go again...


swimming in mid-air.


[class  laughs]


30 seconds weightless.


[class  laughs]


LEWIN: And the plane in which this happens...


[class  laughs]


LEWIN: Yeah, these things happen.


I'd like to show you a last slide of the p lane that they do these experiments from.


This is the plane while it is  in free fall.


About 45-degree ang le and these people have done a tremendous job in  indeed 
making a major contribution to the airsickness due to weightlessness. 

All right, see you Friday.
