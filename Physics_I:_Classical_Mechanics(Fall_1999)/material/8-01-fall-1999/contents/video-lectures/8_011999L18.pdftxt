8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript – Lecture 18 

Here you see the topics tha t w ill be covered by this exam--


twice as much ma teria l as  las t time .


And , o f course, the ma terial is also more d ifficult.


I will touch upon mos t o f these  topics today--


not all--


and I can' t go into great dep th , for obvious reasons.


We don't have the time.


And I wan t to emphasize that wha t is no t covered today does not mean a t a ll tha t it will not be on

the exam.


I want to ask your a ttention for these two key concep ts: the work-energy theorem, which  tells you

that if an objec t moves from A to B tha t the work done on that ob ject is the kine tic energy at point 
B minus the kine tic energy a t poin t A. 

This a lways applies bo th for conservative forces, like gravita tiona l and spring forces, bu t it also 
holds for nonconserva tive forces such as fric tion .


Friction can remove k inetic energy.


It turns kine tic energy  in to heat, and that is perfec tly fine in the work-energy theorem.


However, the conserva tion o f mechan ical energy only holds for conservative forces.


There you have the conservation of the sum of po ten tia l energy and kine tic energy , and now, of

course, you canno t afford to lose kine tic energy through hea t, because  then the conserva tion o f

mechanica l energy would no t hold , and so that can only be used exclusively  in the case of

conservative forces . 

Let's s tart with a simp le examp le of an incline a t an ang le theta. 

I have here an ob ject, mass m, friction coefficient kine tic is mu k, and the static fr iction coe fficien t

equals mu s.


This poin t here, le t tha t be poin t A, and let the bottom o f the incline be B, and let the d istance

between them a long the slope be l.


And the first thing that you wan t to do with a problem like th is, you want  to make wha t we ca ll a

free-body diagram.


That means you want to draw a ll the forces on that object.


Clearly there is gravity , which is mg .


And then there is the normal  force perpendicu lar to the surface.


The sur face pushes up, and we call  this N , the normal  force.


The objec t wants to slide down.


Friction ho lds  it up .


So there is also a fric tiona l force.


And these are  the only three  forces tha t are on it.


So with a  free-body diagram, you won' t know more .


However, I wan t you  to apprecia te the  fact that the force from the sur face onto  this objec t is , of

course, the vectorial sum be tween these two , and tha t is what's called norma lly the contact force .


And that con tact force be tter be exactly the same as mg, but in oppos ite direc tion , otherwise 
there could never be equilibrium. 

Of course, we always split it in to perpendicu lar directions because of  the way tha t we analyze 
this. 

There is no accelera tion in the y d irection, only  in x d irection when it s tarts mov ing, and tha t's why 
we split it. 

Bu t, of course , the vectorial sum is really the  force w ith which the surface pushes on to tha t objec t. 

All righ t, le t's suppose now tha t we increase the ang le theta un til the ob ject star ts to slide . 

So now I'm going to decompose these forces . 

In the x d irection I have here mg sine theta , and the component of gravity  in the y d irection equals

mg cos ine the ta .


Since there is no accelera tion in the y direc tion , the normal force must be also mg cosine the ta.


I lifted up the incline to the poin t tha t it is  just about to s tart slid ing.


And so tha t means that  the fric tiona l force is a maximum va lue possible , which is the sta tic fric tion

coefficien t times N , and therefore that is mu o f s times mg times the cosine o f the ta .


And when will tha t happen? When the  frictional force and mg sine the ta are exactly equa l.


If I go then one hair fur ther , it will start to slide, and so that's the case when th is equals mg sine

theta, and so you lose your mg, and you find tha t mu s equals tangent theta.


That's when it w ill happen.


This  is a way tha t you can measure the s tatic fr iction coefficien t.


Alterna tively , if you know the sta tic fric tion coefficient, you can predic t a t wha t angle that will

occur.


Now, at that situation that it's jus t hanging by  its thumbs, so to speak , by  its fingernails, we touch

it very  lightly , we b low on it--


[imitates blow ing ]--


and it s tar ts to slide.


And now I'm in terested in know ing what  the accelera tion is downhill.


The reason why it w ill be accelera ted , tha t this fric tion coefficien t goes down now to mu k , and so

now there is a  t force a long the slope in the plus x direc tion , and so  I can write down now

Newton's Second Law: ma , wh ich is the force ...


the net  force in the positive x direc tion , would be equal mg times the sine o f the ta minus the

frictional force , but now  this becomes mu k mg cosine theta .


I lose my m, and so the acce leration in the positive x d irection--


that's the way I defined positive x direc tion--


equals g times the sine of  the ta minus mu of k times the cosine of  the ta.


That's accelera tion , and now a natura l question would be, what is the speed a t which it reaches

point B? Well, wha t we wou ld have done early on in the course, we would have said , "Well, if I

know the acce leration , "and  I know  the distance, "and I know the initial speed is zero, "then

clearly that dis tance l must be one-half a t squared , t being the time tha t it takes to go  from A to

B." And so  t would be the square roo t o f 2l divided by a .


What speed wou ld it have at B? Well, the speed a t B would be a  t--


early on 801 .


And so tha t would become , if we mu ltiply this by a , the square roo t o f 2al.


And if you wan t to see tha t in all glor ious deta il,  then of course you'll have to take tha t a and you

have to multip ly tha t by 2l and take the square root.


So we get 2gl  times the sine of  theta minus mu of k times the cosine o f the ta and the whole th ing

to the power one-half.


That is the speed a t poin t B.


I, however , would no t do it that way.


I don't find it very e legan t.


I would say, "Hey, why not app ly the work-energy theorem?" Why not say tha t the work done

when tha t object moves from A to B mus t be  the kinetic energy at point B minus the kinetic

energy a t poin t A? Now , I know tha t I re lease it a t zero speed, so this  is zero . 

And so the kine tic energy at B is clearly one-ha lf m vB squared, so it comes down now to 
applying the work-energy theorem and calcula ting how much work was done by all the forces a t 
stake--

conservative and nonconserva tive , it makes no difference--

and tha t pu ts  it equal to one-ha lf m vB squared.


Well, first o f a ll, when it goes from poin t A to B, gravity  is doing positive work.


It's going down, and the amount o f work that gravity is doing is p lus mgh , but h divided by  l is the

sine o f the ta , so th is is also mgl times the sine o f the ta .


That's positive work done by gravity.


So we have mgl  times the sine of  theta--


that's the positive con tribu tion by gravity--


and now we ge t a negative con tribu tion by fric tion , because the fric tiona l force is uph ill, but the

motion is downhill.


They're 180 degrees opposite, so I don' t have to worry about the dot produc t, because  the cos ine

of the ang le is minus 1, and so I can ignore  the dot and simply take tha t force--


the fric tiona l force--


and multiply  it by that dis tance l, bu t I have to , of course, take the minus sign , because the cosine

of tha t angle equals minus 1 .


And so I let l times the fric tiona l force, which is mu k mg cosine of theta.


And that's the negative work done by the  friction, and  this equals one-half m vB squared .


And I lose an m, and if you look very care fully--


if you're w illing to do tha t in your head--


you bring  the 2 to the le ft, so you ge t 2gl, and then you get the g sine theta mu k cosine theta  to

the power one-ha lf.


You ge t exac tly the same resu lt, and I find this somehow more p leasing  to use  the work-energy

theorem.


So fric tion does nega tive work--


it's conver ted in to hea t.


Bu t tha t's no prob lem  for the work-energy theorem.


We know  in life that fr iction takes kinetic energy ou t.


Whenever some thing is moving , it will come to a halt.


If you sp in a top , tha t we know  tha t the top will not las t very long because of  friction.


And I have here a top .


I hope you can see it shor tly--


there it is .


It's a teeny-weeny little top.


It's very cute--


I p lay w ith it in my office .


I'm rotating it, and you see that  friction is taking ou t kinetic energy and it's converting it to heat.


Please stay on the desk, will you? Will you p lease no t fall on the floor? Ah , it does--


great.


So you see , that's what  friction does.


Kine tic energy has been removed, and now  it has been converted to hea t.


This sur face is a little smoo ther than the desk , and so I will give it a spin here , so it may  last a

little longer, bu t obv iously  it can't las t very  long, so very shortly , it, too , will fall over and come  to

rest, and that kine tic energy w ill have been conver ted into hea t.


All righ t, so le t's con tinue now on ano ther subjec t, and  the one  that  I want to talk to you abou t

now is pendulum.


I have a pendulum, and  the pendu lum a t time t equals zero.


This angle is the ta zero, and  I know wha t tha t angle is .


It's five degrees, which is approximately 0.09 radians.


At  the time t equals zero , I give th is pendulum a tangen tial speed .


I call it v o f B, because I call th is po int B.


It's going  to arc.


I call this A.


So th is is a circle, and it comes to a halt, le t's say here at poin t C .


And then this ang le is the maximum angle possible , is theta maximum.


Let the length o f the pendulum,  for simplicity , simp ly be one meter .


It is small-angle approximation.


The angles will never be very large, as you w ill see later when we ca lcula te the ta maximum, and

so we know tha t we're go ing to ge t a simple harmon ic oscillation to a very good approximation.


So the ta is going  to be tha t angle theta maximum times the cosine--


or if you wan t to , be my guest, you can make this a s ine; I always work with cosines--


omega  t p lus ph i.


And omega equa ls the square root o f g over  l.


I will give you some equations dur ing your exam, bu t th is one I will not give you--

I just assume  that you remember this--

and tha t the period o f the pendulum equals 2 pi times the square roo t o f l over g . 

So we know omega, because we know g and we know  l, and now a reasonable ques tion is , what 
would be the ta max imum? We ll, if we knew this , then we would know wha t the ta maximum is , 
because this part here equa ls l  times the cosine of theta max, and so this  is  l minus l cosine theta 
max. 

So it comes down to calcula ting how h igh this object comes above poin t A. 

Well, I w ill split this  in to two he ights , this one , which I call h1, and this one, which  I call h2. 

And so the one that we really wan t to know  is what is h1 plus h2? Because h1 plus h2 w ill be l

times 1 minus the cosine o f the ta max.


And so the moment we have h1 plus h2, we immedia tely have the maximum angle .


Now, h1 is a piece o f cake , because we know tha t poin t B...


that  this objec t is a t B when theta zero is five degrees .


So h1 equals  l times 1 minus the cosine of  theta zero .


And you know the ta zero.


And so you' ll find, then, if you were interes ted in numbers--


but don' t bo ther  if you don' t like numbers--


for the numbers tha t I gave you, this  is 0 .0038 meters.


It's only 3.8 millimeters .


It's a teeny-weeny little bit.


It's a large displacemen t in th is direc tion bu t very  little in th is d irection.


So we know a lready what h1 is .


So now wha t is h2? We ll, we could now use the conservation o f mechan ical energy, and we

could say , let us ca ll arbitrar ily the gravitational po ten tia l energy a t po int A, le t's ca ll tha t zero.


And going to apply the conserva tion o f mechanical energy, wh ich means that the kinetic energy

at A plus the poten tia l energy a t A must be the kinetic energy a t B plus the po ten tial energy a t B

equals the kine tic energy at C plus the po ten tial energy at C .


Now, the po ten tial energy a t A is zero because we de fine it tha t way.


The kinetic energy a t C  is zero because it comes to a halt.


So now we can write down that one-half m vA squared equals one-half m vB squared p lus mg

times h1--


that is the poten tia l energy a t poin t B--


it's h igher than this poin t A--


vertical separa tion h1--


and tha t equals the po ten tial energy a t poin t C , which is mg times h1 plus h2 .


And if you compare th is par t o f the equation , you see that you lose mgh1 , and so you' ll find tha t m

vB squared--


want to carry the one-ha lf for now , we can still do that--


equals mg times h2 .


And so you will find immed iate ly h2 .


h2 equals v of B squared, wh ich is known .


In our case it must be a known number--


I will give you in a minu te wha t tha t is--


and tha t is divided by 2g .


And th is v of B tha t I had in mind--


numbers are really no t tha t impor tan t; you don' t have a calculator anyhow a t your exam--


but I was going to g ive this a speed of 0.3 me ters per second in this direction in order to keep the

maximum angle quite modest.


So I know h2, and now tha t I know h2 and I know h1 , I can go to  this equa tion and I can ask, wha t

is the cosine o f the ta maximum? h2 , by the way, in case you're in terested in numbers , is about

0.0045 .


So it is 4.5 millimeters .


So it was originally 3.8 millimeters , h1, and now h2 is 4.5 millime ters higher .


So you can calcu late  the cosine of theta max.


However, I said to myself, if we use the conserva tion o f mechanical energy , can we no t also use

the work-energy theorem? Why no t? Tha t should work as well.


The work-energy theorem te lls me that the work done on that object when the object moves from

A to B equals the kine tic energy at B minus the kinetic energy a t A.


That is one-ha lf m vB squared minus one-half m vA squared.


And how much work was done by grav ity  in going  from A to B? Because gravity is the only force

that does work .


The tension is no t doing any work, because the tension , wh ich is  in this d irection, is always

perpendicular to the direc tion o f mo tion .


And work is a do t product be tween force and  the direction o f mo tion , perpend icular to each other.


So tha t's zero .


So it's only mg tha t ma tters--


the gravitational force .


Well, when it goes from A  to B, the work done by gravity is minus mgh1 .


Object goes up , it does nega tive work, equals minus mgh1.


Now, look at that equation, and look, if you wan t to , here.


Compare  this one with this one .


Complete ly identical.


So the work-energy theorem is, of course, in a way the same as the conservation of mechanical

energy.


The work done when the object goes  from B to C  is the kine tic energy a t C minus the kinetic 
energy a t B. 

That equals one-half m vC squared minus one-half m vB squared, and tha t is the work that 
gravity  is do ing when the ob ject goes from B  to C .


And that work  is minus mgh2.


So th is equals minus mgh2 .


This  is zero .


And so you see , what you see here is exac tly what you see here.


The two are iden tical.


And so you could have used  the work-energy theorem, or you can use the conservation o f

mechanica l energy.


That makes no d ifference .


And so you now can calcula te theta maximum, and for those of you who wan t some numbers, I

found that theta maximum was plus or minus 7 .4 degrees.


You always ge t two angles .


And in radians, tha t would be plus or minus 0 .13 radians.


You know wha t the cosine of the angle is , so you always get two angles .


There's noth ing you can do about it.


And so now you can ask yourse lf the question, wha t is phi? Ph i is always a bit o f a pa in in the

neck, and there is really not all tha t much physics  in phi.


Bu t I was sort o f curious for these initia l conditions what phi would be.


And so let's  just  take a qu ick look a t tha t.


And so if we wan t to know what phi is , we have  to look at the initia l condition that at  t equals zero

the velocity a t poin t B is p lus 0 .3 in this d irection, and we know tha t theta equals the ta zero , and

we know wha t the ta zero is--


that was the five degrees , tha t is the .09 radians.


And so I'm go ing to subs titu te that in my solu tion.


So I know when t equals zero , I know tha t the ta equa ls theta zero .


So the ta zero--


I know wha t the ta zero is; we just calculated wha t theta max  is ; times the cosine of ph i a t t equa ls

zero.


And so out pop two angles of phi, plus and minus phi 1.


You always find a p lus and a minus sign because the cosine o f plus the ang le is the same as the

cosine o f minus the angle .


So now we have to find out which o f the two it is.


By the way, when you find that theta maximum equals plus or minus 0.13 radians, you could have

picked either plus or minus.


I p icked the plus .


If you would have picked the minus, you would have found a different phase angle , bu t you can't

pick minus.


I just wan t to remind you tha t I picked the plus  in wha tever follows.


And so now I have to take in to accoun t the fac t tha t at t equa ls zero tha t I know the velocity vB.


And how does that come in? Well, I take  the derivative of tha t equa tion there, and so I ge t tha t d

theta/d t--


which is the angular velocity  in radians per second a t any moment in time , but we're going to

evaluate it at t equals zero--


equals minus omega  the ta max times the sine o f omega t plus phi, bu t we will evalua te it a t t

equals zero .


What is d the ta/dt? We ll, d theta/d t is v divided by  l.


This  is v divided by  l and is there fore plus 0.3--


this plus because at t equals zero , the ang le is increasing.


So it is plus .


How do we know  it's v over  l? We ll, remember, we discussed that be fore .


If the pendulum changes the angle by an amount d theta, and if this arc here--


I call tha t ds--


and if the length is  l then the de finition o f d the ta--


the angle in radians--


is ds d ivided by  l.


If you divide bo th sides by d t, which mathematicians cannot do , bu t physicists can , then you get d

theta/d t equals ds/dt, and tha t is the velocity d ivided by  l.


So you see  tha t d theta/d t is v divided by  l.


And so we now have a second equa tion.


We now can solve for sine phi.


That gives you again  two angles .


That gives you an angle ph i 2 and  that gives you 180 degrees minus phi 2 .


They have the same value for s ine phi.


Bu t on ly one o f th is will be the same as one o f these , and that's the one tha t you p ick.


And in my case, where  for my va lue of plus 0 .13 , I find  then that phi equals minus 0 .82 radians .


It is abou t minus 47 degrees.


There's not much physics  in the phase angle .


What is  interesting perhaps  is to men tion tha t if we had chosen the speed a t times t equa ls zero ,

if we had g iven the speed in this direction of 0 .3 me ters per second, the the ta max imum would

not have changed--


of course no t--


but the ph i would have changed .


In fact, the ph i tha t you would have found would have been p lus 0 .82 .


And for those of you who had preferred to use the theta max imum to take minus 0 .13 , they would

have found a differen t phase angle a ltogether.


All righ t.


By now this top, of course , must be dead l ike a doornail.


So le t's jus t take a look at that.


And I can' t be lieve--


what's going on? Do you understand why  it's s till ro ta ting? Why  is fric tion no t...? 
Holy smoke! The basic founda tions o f physics are at stake aga in. 

And it seems tha t every time a t lectures, we seem to have a way to overthrow  them. 

Friction must  take kinetic energy ou t. 

I'm extreme ly puzzled. 

Let's not look a t it. 

I ha te this. 

Things that I canno t explain, I ha te them. 

Let's  just no t look a t it. 

Let's go on. 

We can always take a look a t the end of  the lecture and see what it's doing . 

By tha t time it's go t to be dead , right? It can' t go on forever.


So , let's now talk about a spr ing.


What I jus t did with the pendulum, I can do someth ing s imilar with a spring , similar in  the sense

that a t time t equals zero I stre tch the spring a little and I give it a kick and then  I let it oscillate.


Very similar to wha t I just did , but now  it is a simpler problem, because a spr ing is exac tly one-

dimens ional.


Let this be the re laxed leng th l of the spring.


This  is po int A.


I s tretch it to poin t B.


I g ive it a kick .


I will not pu t in any numbers now .


I'll give it a speed vB and it comes to a ha lt here at po in t C .


Let the spring cons tan t be k, and we know we're going  to get a ...


so th is is a t equals zero--


we're going to ge t a simple harmonic oscillation, x equa ls x max.


This  is go ing to be x max.


This  is go ing to be xB.


And th is is x o f A, which is zero .


So we're going to get x max times the cosine o f omega t p lus ph i--


same old story , it's getting pre tty boring.


Omega equals the square roo t of k over m, and T equa ls two pi div ided by omega.


These equa tions you w ill no t see on your exam.


What is now x max? How would you approach it? You've jus t seen how  I d id it with the pendulum.


I used  first the conserva tion o f mechanical energy--


there was no friction--


and then I showed you that it's comple tely consistent with the work-energy theorem, so what

would you do now? How do we ge t x max? Any sugges tions? Any proposals? Come on! You 
must have learned some thing from the last  ten minutes. 

Any  idea? It's the same concept.


We know the initial cond itions, and we know  it's a simp le harmonic oscilla tion, and we wan t to

know wha t the maximum d isplacemen t is going to be .


Anyone with the courage to speak out? In the worst case, you're wrong .


Believe me , I am wrong so often , if only you knew.


[student responds ]


LEW IN : So speak up.


Shall we  try the conservation o f mechanical energy?  Is there anyth ing wrong with tha t? Nothing

wrong with it.


Let's try the conservation of mechanical energy.


The conservation o f mechanical energy tells me that  the kine tic energy at A plus the potential

energy a t A must be the kine tic energy at B p lus the po tential energy at B, and  tha t must be equal 
to the kine tic energy at C plus the po ten tial energy a t C . 

Right? There is no  friction, there are no nonconservative forces , so this has go t to work. 

Well, the po tential energy at A is zero , because remember, the po ten tial energy o f a spring is 
one-half k x squared, if x  is the displacement from its re laxed position. 

So th is is zero.


When it comes to a halt here , this  is zero.


When I watched this  lec ture, I no ticed a slip o f the tongue.


Clearly the po ten tial energy a t A is zero That's fine.


Bu t a t C, the ob ject is stand ing still, so at C  it is the kine tic energy tha t is zero and no t the

poten tia l energy.


And I con tinued the problem correctly , because I wrote down here one-half k x max squared ,

which is exactly this term.


That is the po ten tia l energy a t C, which reaches a maximum.


It is the kine tic energy tha t is zero here .


And I acciden tally men tioned tha t it was the po ten tial energy that is zero, which is obviously no t

so.


So we get that one-half m vA squared equa ls one-half m vB squared minus one-half k x o f B

squared--


that is the poten tia l energy a t th is loca tion--


and tha t equals one-half k x of C, wh ich we have called x max, squared , and you are in business.


If I tell you where the ob ject is--


with the pendulum, I gave you the initia l angle , my the ta zero--

I tell you where the object is , so you know x o f B, I tell you wha t speed I gave it, so you know this 
one, you can calcu late what the maximum displacemen t is . 

Exactly the same idea, and if you wan t to app ly the work-energy theorem, of course , you will get 
exactly the same resu lt. 

This  is, in fac t, the same thing .


So le t's now turn to Newton's universal law of gravity, and be lieve it or not, I think I even give you

on the exam the gravita tional force o f New ton's universal law o f gravity .


I don't think you need it, but you will  find it on  the exam.


Let's take the Earth going around  the sun, and le t's approxima te the orbit by a circle .


So here is the Earth , here is the sun, mass sun , and the orbital radius  is capital R.


The Ear th has an orb ita l velocity , I ca ll it v orbital, and  there is on the ob ject the angular velocity,

say, is omega .


It goes around with a cer tain angular velocity.


And there has to be here a force on  the sys tem, the gravitational  force, which is the same as the

centripe tal force.


That's the only way the objec t can go around in a circle .


So th is gravita tiona l force equals mass o f the sun mass of the Ear th times G divided by R

squared--


the force of gravity.


Bu t it also mus t equal to the centr ipetal accelera tion , and this  is here  the mass of the Ear th , and 
so it also is the mass o f the Earth times the orbital speed v squared d ivided by the orbital radius, 
and if you pre fer to write tha t in terms o f omega squared R,  that's fine , too . 

Look a t this here .


You lose your Ear th mass , if you want  to know what your orbital speed is, you lose one R, and so

you find tha t the orb ita l speed equals the mass o f the sun times g divided by R to  the power one-
half, and tha t is about 30 kilome ters per second . 

I g ive it in kilome ters per second , but o f course when you calculate it, make sure you always stay 
in MKS be fore you make a conversion to o ther units.


So you know what the period is to go around the sun .


That is 2 pi R div ided by the orbital, and tha t is about 365Ω days--


that's one year .


That's how  long it takes us to go around the sun .


Now I wonder, wha t is the kine tic energy o f the Earth in orbit around the sun? We ll,  tha t's

comple tely triv ial, you wou ld say , because it is one-half of the mass of the Ear th times the orb ita l

speed squared.


Indeed , tha t is not very d ifficult.


So the kine tic energy of  the Ear th in orbit equals one-half mass of  the Ear th times v orb it squared .


So I take  this equa tion and I square it.


I lose the half there , and so I get M ear th M sun times G div ided by R .


That is the kinetic energy  in orbit.


Bu t tha t...


oh, there's a half here.


Whenever I make a slip , you should always  in terrupt.


So there is the half here .


This  is also minus one-ha lf the potential energy.


And remember, the poten tia l energy equals minus M sun M earth G divided by R .


So here you see plus ha lf, here you see minus 1, so this is indeed minus half the po ten tial

energy.


What is the  tota l energy o f the Earth around the sun? That means the sum o f poten tia l energy

and kinetic energy .


Well, the kine tic energy  is minus one-ha lf U, and the po tential energy  is U , and so this  is...


this  is plus one-half U .


That means  it's nega tive , because U itself is negative.


It is also equal to minus K.


I just calcula ted for fun how  large that number  is--


it's a negative number--


how large tha t is, and it  turns out to be approx ima tely minus 2.7 times ten to the 33 joules.


Deeply nega tive.


Now, if we ge t bored and we want to leave the solar system, then we can ask ourse lves the

question, if we moun t a rocket  to the Earth and we fire that rocket, how much speed should we 
give it to ge t away from  the sun once and for all and never come back? Well, all we wou ld have to 
do is make  the to tal energy o f the Earth zero, so it can cruise all  the way to infinity and have zero 
speed when it ge ts there . 

How can I make this zero? Well, I have to add to the kinetic energy exactly K, because minus K 
plus K is zero .


If I have to add the kine tic energy K, then the new kinetic energy after the rocke t burn wou ld be

exactly 2K.


The potential energy  is no t changing, because you fire the rocket when you're there , and so 
you're still at the same position a fter the rocke t fire , and so your po ten tial energy hasn' t changed , 
but your kinetic energy must have doubled. 

If it hasn' t doub led,  this doesn't become zero.


Aha ! Bu t if the kinetic energy has doub led,  then the speed must have gone up by the square roo t

of two , because kinetic energy is propor tiona l to v squared, so  the escape ve locity that you need

must be the square roo t of two times the orbital velocity , and tha t would be for the Ear th the

square roo t o f two  times 30, which is abou t 42 kilometers per second .


So by looking at  the energy considera tions , you can find the connection between to tal energy ,

escape velocity, and make the who le picture interna lly consisten t.


We talked for one whole lecture about resis tive forces.


I s till remember the number of  that lec ture--


it was number 12--


because it's the one lec ture tha t I worked on it more than on any other with the he lp of my

graduate studen t Dave Poo ley, who did these wonder ful calcu lations, these numerical solu tions .


And so let's ta lk a little bit about the resis tive forces .


If an objec t moves through a med ium--


air or a liquid--


there is a resistive force which always opposes the velocity.


It has two terms : k1 times v--


this  is the speed , this  is a lways positive--


plus k2 times v squared, and this  is the unit vec tor o f the velocity.


It's always opposing the velocity, so this  is the magnitude o f the resistive force.


We dealt exclusive ly with spheres--


remember? And we d id some huge exper iments .


For spheres , k1 equals c1 times r and k2 equals c2  times r squared.


And we did some experiments with corn syrup.


And th is was a syrup for wh ich c1 was approxima tely 160 and c2 was about 1 .2 times ten to the

third kilograms per cub ic me ters.


I a lways remember the un its of this because tha t's a lways density .


In fact, it's always a little smaller than the ac tual density of the liquid, o f the syrup itself.


This  is a more complicated un it, but you can figure tha t one ou t for yourself.


And so we had ball bearings from an eighth-o f-an-inch diame ter to a quar ter o f an inch , and we

dropped them in the Karo syrup.


If we take the one for now , wh ich is a quar ter-of-an-inch diame ter,  then the mass o f that one is

about 0 .1 grams .


We knew the density o f s teel, and so you can figure out the mass, jus t take my word for  it.


And so the ques tion now  is , if this ball bearing star ts to  fall, what is the speed tha t it will ach ieve?

Well, in the beginning , there is only mg on tha t ba ll and a teeny-weeny little resistive force.


As the speed builds up, the resis tive force will grow and there comes a time that it's equal to mg,

and then the object will not be accelera ted anymore and it will have wha t we call  the termina l

velocity .


And so what are the cond itions for termina l ve locity? That this term equa ls mg .


In o ther words , tha t c1 r v plus c2 r squared v squared becomes equa l to mg , and when that's the

case, then we have reached the terminal velocity.


Well, this  is a quadratic equation in v o f t.


You know c1, you know c2 , you know  the radius of these ball bearings, you know the mass o f the

ball bearings , so you can so lve for the  terminal velocity.


You will ge t two solu tions; it's a quadra tic equa tion .


One w ill be nonphysical, you will see , so you keep the one tha t is physical.


Bu t if you d id tha t, tha t would be a silly thing to do.


And the reason why that wou ld be silly  is that  I cla im that this term... 

which by the way we call the pressure term, tha t this term can be comple tely  ignored compared to 
this term, which we call the viscous term. 

How do we know tha t tha t pressure term can be ignored? We ll, let's firs t ask the question, when 
is the viscous term and the pressure term the same for what velocity? So forget for now tha t here 
are t's . 

We jus t want  to know tha t this term is the same as this term.


That will be the case when the veloc ity , wh ich we call the critical velocity, equa ls c1 divided by c2

times r .


It's very easy to show tha t th is term is then exac tly  iden tical to  that one.


There's noth ing critical about that number .


Really, it's a wrong name , critical velocity, bu t we g ive it tha t name.


It simply means tha t the two  terms are equal--


that's all it means, no thing else .


If you ca lcula te for a quarter-inch-diame ter s teel ball bearing, you can ca lcula te r , you will find tha t

the critica l velocity  is abou t 100 miles per hour , and we know very we ll there is no way when you 
drop a quar ter-inch ball bearing in to this syrup tha t it's going to come anywhere near tha t, so the 
speed will rema in way be low 100 miles per hour, and therefore th is is a term tha t will dominate 
and this term can be comple tely  ignored. 

And if tha t term can be ignored, you can see tha t immediate ly the termina l ve locity  is going  to be 
mg divided by c1r, and that, by the way, for our quar ter-inch ball bearing , turns ou t to be 
something like two cen time ters per second--

many, many orders o f magnitude lower than the 100 miles per hour , wh ich was the critical 
velocity .


What we did is we measured the times for these ball bearings to fall over a distance o f four

centimeters.


And if you know the time to go a distance o f four cen timeters, you know the terminal ve locity .


And we know the mass o f the ball bearing , we know  the radii o f the ball bearing , we know c1 ...


no, we d idn' t know c1 .


I just wan ted to point ou t to you tha t you can measure c1 that way.


You measure the speed , you know r , you know m, you measure c1, and that's wha t I did be fore

the lecture tha t morning.


That's how I came up w ith that number 160 , otherwise I wouldn't have known .


c1 is ex tremely tempera ture-dependen t.


In fact, it even changed between c lasses.


If the tempera ture goes up, the va lue for c1 goes down.


So tha t's the way you can measure the value for c1.


Okay, conservation o f momen tum.


We dealt with the conserva tion o f momen tum in one lecture--


your paren ts were here--


and we on ly dea lt exclusively with comp letely  inelas tic collisions .


Whenever we have a system of objects with zero ne t external force , the momentum must be

conserved.


They can collide , they can cause  fireworks, they can explode , they can break up in pieces , but

momen tum will be conserved in the absence of any ne t external force .


It's a very nonintu itive concep t.


Kine tic energy can be destroyed , but momentum canno t be des troyed in the absence o f a net

external force on the system as a whole .


We have an ob ject m1 here, speed v1, object m2, speed v2.


Let's make it very s imp le--


m1 is one kilogram, v1 is three me ters per second, m2 is two kilograms, and v2 equals ...


I make th is five me ters per second , and I make this three meters per second .


Momen tum is conserved, so I can write down tha t m1 times v1 plus m2 times v2 must be m1 plus

m2--


it is a comple tely  inelastic collision--


times v prime.


They come together, they stick toge ther,  the to tal mass is going to be m1 plus m2 , and they're

going to fly e ither  in this d irection or  in  this direction, bu t whatever  it is , I call it v prime--


it's a fter the collision.


You may say, "Hey, you forgot your arrows here," because th is is a vector equa tion .


Yeah , I purposely forgot  them, because this is a one-dimensional case .


You can always  leave the arrows off, because the signs take care of it.


And you, o f course, have to be generous, namely you have to pu t the minus signs  in when

needed .


mv is one times five,  tha t is plus five.


m2 v2 is going to be nega tive , because I mus t now observe th is as a minus three , so I ge t minus 
six, so the momen tum be fore and a fter the co llision must be minus one and that must be equa l to 
three times v prime . 

And v prime is therefore minus one- third me ters per second. 

And so this objec t w ill stick , and after the collision , they will move with a speed of one- third of a

meter per second .


Kine tic energy was a lmost exclusively  lost.


There was almos t noth ing le ft, remember? Clearly tha t's because of fr iction--


not externa l friction ; there is no ex ternal  friction, because if there were any ex terna l friction,

momen tum wou ld not be conserved .


Think of them as the  two car wrecks--


they go into each o ther.


Fireworks! Man, you hear them scratch , me tal over me tal.


A lot o f heat is produced , k inetic energy is removed.


Bu t momen tum is conserved , because those fric tional forces are a ll internal.


And that's fine.


So tha t is why it is such a very nonintu itive concep t.


Let's now make sure tha t this crazy ob ject has come to a halt.


If no t, I... oh , I better not say what I was going to do.


My goodness!  It's s till ro ta ting ! Now, I realize tha t it may cause you sleepless n igh ts, but on the

other hand , w ith an exam coming up, I wou ld suggest you jus t forge t abou t this .


Pretend you haven't seen it.


Pretend this never happened .


That may make you happier.


Okay, see you Monday , and good luck.
