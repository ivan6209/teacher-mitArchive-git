8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript – Lecture 16 

All righ t, las t time we ta lked exclusively abou t complete ly ine lastic collisions.


Today I will  talk abou t collisions  in more general terms .


Let's take a one-dimensional case.


We have here m1 and we have here m2 , and to make life a little easy , we' ll make v2 zero and

this partic le has veloc ity v1.


After the collision , m2 has a ve locity v2 prime, and m1,  let it have a velocity v1 prime .


I don't even know whe ther  it's  in this direc tion or whe ther it is  in that direc tion .


You will see that either one is possible .


To find v1 prime and to find v2 prime , it's clear tha t you now need two equa tions.


And if there is no net external force on the system as a whole during the co llisions , then

momen tum is conserved.


And so you can write down tha t m1 v1 mus t be m1 v1 prime plus m2 v2 prime .


Now, you may wan t to put arrows over there to indicate tha t these are vectors, but since it's a

one-dimensiona l case , you can leave the arrows o ff and the signs will then au toma tically take

care of  the direction.


If you ca ll th is plus, then if you get a minus sign, you know that the ve locity  is  in the opposite

direction .


So now we need a second equa tion .


Now, in physics we do believe very strong ly in the conservation o f energy, no t necessarily in the

conservation o f kinetic energy .


As you have seen las t time , you can destroy kine tic energy.


Bu t somehow we believe tha t if you destroy energy , it must come out in some o ther form, and you

cannot create energy ou t of no thing .


And in the case o f the comp letely  inelas tic co llisions that we have seen las t time , we lost kine tic

energy, which was conver ted to heat.


There was in terna l friction .


When the car wreck plowed into each o ther , there was  interna l friction--


no ex ternal fric tion--


and tha t took out kine tic energy . 

And so, in its most general form, you can write down that the kine tic energy before the collision 
plus some number Q equals the kinetic energy after the collision . 

And if you know Q, then you have a second equa tion , and then you can solve  for v1 prime and for 
v2 prime.


If Q is  larger than zero , then you have gained kinetic energy.


That is possible ; we did that last  time.


We had two cars which were connec ted by a spring , and we burned the w ire and each went o ff in

the opposite direction .


There was no kine tic energy be fore... if you want to call it  the co llision, bu t there was k inetic

energy a fterwards.


That was the po ten tia l energy o f the spring  that was converted in to kinetic energy.


So Q can be larger than zero .


We call tha t a supere lastic collision .


It could be an explosion.


That's a superelas tic co llision.


And then there is the possib ility tha t Q equals zero, a very special case.


We will deal with tha t today, and we call that an elas tic collision .


I will often call it a comple tely elas tic co llision, which is really not necessary.


"Elastic" itself a lready means Q is zero.


And then there is a case--


of which we have seen several examples  las t time--


of inelas tic co llisions, when you lose kine tic energy, so this  is an inelastic collision .


And so, if you know wha t Q is, then you can solve these equa tions.


Whenever Q is less than zero , whenever you lose kine tic energy , the loss, in general, goes in to

heat.


Now I wan t to con tinue a case whereby I have a completely elas tic co llision .


So Q is zero .


Momen tum is conserved, because there was no net external force, so now kine tic energy is also

conserved.


And so I can write down now one-half m1 v1 squared--


that was the kinetic energy be fore the collision--

must be the kinetic energy a fter the co llision one-half m1 v1 prime squared p lus one-half m2 v2 
prime squared . 

This  is my equation number one, and this  is my equa tion number two . 

And they can be solved ; you can solve them. 

They are solved in your book . 

I will simply g ive you  the results , because the results are very in teres ting to p lay w ith . 

That's wha t we will be doing  today. 

v1 prime w ill be m1 minus m2 divided by m1 plus m2 times v1 and v2 prime w ill be 2 m1 divided 
by m1 plus m2 times v1. 

The first  thing  that you already see righ t away is that v2 prime is always in  the same direc tion as 
v1. 

That's comple tely obvious , because the second objec t was standing still, remember? So if you 
plow some thing in to the second object, they obviously continue in tha t d irection.


That's clear .


So you see you can never have a sign reversal here .


Here, however , you can have a sign reversal.


If you bounce a ping-pong ball o ff a billiard ball, the ping-pong ball will come back and this one

becomes nega tive , whereas  if you plow a billiard ball in to a ping-pong ba ll, it w ill go forward.


And so this can both be negative and can be positive depending upon whether the upsta irs is 
negative or positive . 

So th is is the result which holds under three conditions : tha t the kinetic energy  is conserved, so Q 
is zero; that momentum is conserved; and  tha t v2 be fore the collision equals zero .


Let's  look a t three interes ting cases whereby we go to extremes.


And le t's first take  the case tha t m1 is much , much larger than m2 .


m1 is much , much larger than m2 .


Ano ther way o f thinking abou t tha t is tha t let m2 go to zero.


Extreme case, the limiting case.


So it's  like having a bow ling ball tha t you collide with a ping-pong ball.


If you look at that equation when m2 goes to zero--


this  is zero , this  is zero--


notice that v1 prime equals v1.


That is comp letely  intuitive.


If a bowling ball collides w ith a ping-pong ball  the bowling ba ll doesn't even see the p ing-pong

ball.


It continues  its rou te as if noth ing happened .


That's exactly wha t you see .


After the collision , the bow ling ball con tinues unaltered.


What is v2 prime? That is no t so in tuitive .


If you substitu te in there m2 equals zero, then you get plus 2 v1--


not obvious at all, plus 2 v1.


It's not something I even wan t you to see; I can' t see it either .


I'll do a demonstra tion .


You can see tha t it really happens.


So , now you take a bow ling ball and you collide the bowling ball with the p ing-pong ba ll and the

ping-pong ball w ill ge t a veloc ity 2 v1--


not more , not less--


and the bowling ball con tinues at  the same speed.


Now le t's take a case whereby m1 equals much, much less than m2 ; in other words , in the

limiting case , m1 goes to zero .


And we substitu te tha t in here.


So m1 goes to zero , so  this  is zero and so you see v1 prime equa ls minus v1.


v1 prime equals minus v1 , comp letely obvious .


The ping-pong ball bounces off the bowling ba ll and it just bounces back.


And th is is wha t you see .


And the bowling ba ll doesn't do any thing, because m1 goes to zero , so v2 prime goes to zero.


So tha t's very  intu itive.


And now we have a very cute case tha t m1 equals m2 .


And when you substitu te tha t in here--


when m1 equa ls m2--


v1 prime becomes zero .


So the  first one stops with v2 prime becomes v1. 

If m1 equals m2 , you have two downs tairs here and two upstairs and you see that v2 prime 
equals v1 . 

And that is a remarkable case--

you've all seen that, you've a ll played with Newton's cradle. 

You have two billiard ba lls. 

One is still and the o ther one bangs on it. 

The first one s tops and the second one takes o ff with the speed o f the firs t. 

An amazing th ing . 

We've all seen it. 

I presume you have all seen it. 

Most people do this with pendu lums where  they bounce these balls agains t each o ther . 

I will do it here with a mode l tha t you can see a little easier. 

I have here billiard ba lls, and if I bounce th is one on this one,  then we have case number three. 

Then you see  this one stands still and th is one takes over the speed--

quite amazing . 

Every time I see this , I love it. 

It is a wonderful thing to see. 

Nature ... just imagine you are na ture, and this ball comes on, and in no  time at all you have to

solve these two equa tions very quickly.


There's only one so lution, and na ture knows how to do  that.


This one s tops and th is one goes on .


It's an amaz ing result.


And I'm sure tha t you have seen these pendulums that you can play with.


Here we have no t a bow ling ball on to a ping-pong ball but we have a billiard ba ll.


The mass ratio is no t infinity to one but it's 500 to one, which is quite large .


And so what I will firs t do is very in tuitive .


I will firs t bounce the ping-pong ball o ff the bowling ball...


the billiard ball.


The ping-pong ball comes back almost with the same speed--

not quite, because  the ratio is no t infinity to one but it is 500 to one , and the b illiard ball will do 
practically no thing . 

It's exactly wha t you see there in case  two. 

So , there we go. 

You see,  the ping-pong ball comes back almost as far as I le t it go . 

It te lls you tha t the speed ... 

Oh! That the speed has no t changed . 

It jus t bounces back and the billiard ball almost does no thing . 

Now comes case number one . 

That's the nonin tuitive case. 

It is  intuitive tha t if the b illiard ball hits the ping-pong ball that it w ill continue . 

As you will see, v1 pr ime is v1, with the same speed . 

It's not a t a ll in tuitive tha t the ping-pong will get tw ice the speed o f the billiard ball, and , o f course, 
you canno t see tha t quantita tive ly because we don' t do a quan tita tive measurement of  the speed 
of the ping-pong ball, bu t you will see tha t it bounces up quite high . 

So , there we go. 

The billiard ball on to the ping-pong ball. 

Look at the b illiard ball alone--

forge t the ping-pong ball--

and try to see  tha t the speed of  the billiard ball is practically una ffected by the collision . 

That's wha t you see there--

v1 prime is v1 . 

You see , it's practically una ffec ted . 

Now, of course, it is way harder to see that the ping-pong ba ll gets tw ice the speed of  the billiard 
ball, 
because we don' t do... 

because we don' t do a quantita tive measuremen t. 

All righ t. 

So , those were examples,  then , o f those  three possibilities that you all see on the blackboard 
there . 

Now I wan t to do more comp lete ly e lastic collisions, and I'm going to do tha t w ith  the air track.


I'm going to try to make complete ly elastic collis ions.


That's no t so easy.


I will have one objec t s tand still, so always v2 equals zero.


And they are comple tely elas tic.


Kine tic energy  is conserved .


This word "comple tely"  is no t necessary.


I a lways add it in my mind .


I'm going to have one objec t m1 which  I bang agains t object m2 , and objec t m2 will be s tanding

here, will have no speed .


And objec t m1 comes in from this side and I'll try to make the collision elas tic.


And the way I will do tha t is by using springs which are attached to each mass.


And springs are conservative forces so there is almost no hea t tha t is genera ted in the springs

during the collision .


And so to a reasonable approximation, you will ge t an elastic collis ion, bu t, o f course, there's

always air drag .


I can never take air drag ou t.


So there's always some ex ternal  force on the system.


So momen tum is never exac tly conserved , and kine tic energy is never exactly conserved either,

so it's only an approxima tion .


So I have one mass o f un it 1--


I will te ll you what that is--


and I bang tha t in to number 2 .


And the masses tha t I have...


One mass  is 241 p lus or minus one gram, and the o ther mass tha t I have is 482 plus or minus

one gram.


And I have two o f these .


And in my first experimen t I w ill use these  two, so th is is the ra tio tha t you see, one to one.


I will give it a certa in ve locity , which I canno t tell you what tha t is.


It depends upon how happy I feel.


If I push hard , then  the ve locity will be high .


If I push softly , the velocity w ill be low .


Bu t it is some thing .


And then we are go ing to ge t here v1 prime , and there is a prediction tha t this velocity w ill be

zero.


Look all the way on the blackboard there .


You will see if the masses are the same and there is an elas tic collision , th is one will s tand still

and this one , v2 prime , will have a velocity v1.


So tha t's a prediction.


The second case , I bounce one car onto another one which is tw ice the mass--


certain velocity wh ich I don't know wha t it is--


and now what are we going to ge t? So mass m1 is half the mass of m2.


So th is is a 1 and this  is a 2 and this is 3 .


1 minus 2 is minus 1 divided by 3 is minus 1/3.


So number one comes back--


no surprise .


If you bounce a ligh ter objec t o ff a more massive object, no surprise that it bounces back.


So tha t's minus one-third, and when we look here , we have 2 times 1 divided by 1 plus 2 is 3.


That is plus two- thirds , so number one will come back with a speed one-third--


which, of course , since  this  is sign-sensitive , we get one-third v1 and this one is plus two- thirds

v1.


That's the prediction.


And the way we're going to measure it is by measuring  the time for the objec ts to move over a

distance of  ten centime ters.


No matter how  long you see these cars to be, there is here a piece of metal which is ten

centimeters long.


It goes through a slot with a diode .


We have one system here and one there.


And during this ten-cen time ter movemen t, we measure the  time.


We begin when this p iece of meta l en ters the diode sys tem and we stop the time when it leaves

the diode system.


And each one of  those cars has th is ten-centimeter metal plate .


So , the way we're go ing to do this is by measuring timing, of course.


This ve locity will g ive me a cer tain time, and  this ve locity will give me a cer tain time .


Whatever comes out, you will see tha t on this timer .


Then t1 prime ...


is... in this case...


it s tands still, so it must be zero.


And t2 prime must be the same as t1.


So these  two numbers, you should be able  to compare directly .


What kind o f uncer tainties do we have? It's hard to te ll.


Bu t I would say, as I argued las t time,  that you should a llow for at leas t abou t 2Ω percent

uncertain ty  in each time .


If it comes out be tter, then you are lucky.


If it comes out worse , then it is a bad day .


2Ω percen t, and  I argued last time how I reasoned about the 2Ω percen t.


Now we do th is exper iment.


We ge t a cer tain  t1.


And so this one goes back w ith one- third o f the speed , so it will take three times  longer to go  ten

centimeters.


So I'm going to multip ly this time by one-th ird, and wha tever comes ou t should be the same as

this.


So , let me move th is up a little... t2 prime.


The speed here , the  forward speed , is two-th irds, so it will go slower.


So if  I multiply this time by two-thirds,  then I should be able to compare it with t1 .


And all o f tha t, all these times , I th ink, will no t be any better  than roughly 2Ω percen t, excep t if we

are a little lucky.


[system powers up ]


Okay, the system is up .


The timers are up , the timers are up .


This w ill be the time t1 .


This w ill be the time t2 prime, and this  is the one when  the objec t bounces back, so  this  is t1 
prime . 

You won' t see  that it is negative.


It will go back through the same s lot, and the electronics is arranged in such a way tha t when it

goes back through the same slot that it w ill initia te th is time .


I will zero them.


First you have to te ll me whe ther they are working .


I will just le t it go through these slo ts.


Is this one working? Te ll me  that  this one is working.


If I send this one back, is this one working? Okay .


Okay,  there we go.


This  is the one tha t will have no speed , and th is is the one that we're going to give a ve locity .


You are ready? I hope you know what you are going to see.


This one w ill come to a halt, and th is will go on.


They have the same mass.


There we go.


This one is  indeed coming to a halt and  this one took over the speed .


What are the numbers? 194 and 196--


only two milliseconds' difference.


That is an incredib le resu lt.


0.194 and 0 .196 .


There's only one percent difference between them--


way within my wildest expec tations.


Because my expec tations were tha t they could be off each by 2Ω percent.


Now we go to  the one-to-two .


So here is the car wh ich has twice the mass.


It's  important that I zero it.


And now th is one is going to come back .


So you're going to see this one come in , give you the time here.


This one goes through here, it g ives you the time here.


This one w ill come back, it gives you the time here.


Are they zero?  Okay? You're ready? Yeah? There we go.

Okay. Now , now comes the rea l ac id test.


123... 186 .


123...


And what is the las t one? 375 .


Okay, le t me be lazy and le t me use my calcula tor .


375 divided by three--


I cou ld have done tha t by heart, o f course--


this  is 0 .125 , an amaz ing agreemen t! Amaz ing! Only two percen t o ff, less than  two percent.


Now here , 0.186 times 2 d ivided by 3--


0.124 .


I can' t believe it--


less than a percen t off.


So , you see in fron t of your eyes tha t we were able to create some thing tha t was indeed

extremely close  to elastic collisions  in spite o f all the problems : tha t we have a ir drag, and that, of

course there is always some loss o f kinetic energy .


Bu t it's so little tha t it doesn't show up in these measuremen ts.


Now I wan t you  to have a sleepless n igh t.


I want you to think abou t the fo llowing and if you can't solve it before the nigh t is over , then  I

really think you should lie awake.


Here is the wall.


Here is a tenn is ba ll tha t comes  in with a cer tain mass m, and it has a certa in ve locity v, wha tever

that is .


It's a nearly e lastic collision and it bounces back from the wall.


And we all know that if it is a near ly elastic collision tha t it comes back with the same ve locity.


Kine tic energy  is conserved .


All the kinetic energy is  in the tennis ball; no thing is  in the wall.


The wall has an infinitely  large mass, but the momen tum o f th is tennis ball has changed by an

amoun t 2 mv. 

That momentum must be in the wa ll--


it's nonnego tiable , because momen tum must be conserved.


So now here you see in  front o f your eyes a case that the wall has momen tum, but it has no

kinetic energy .


Can you unders tand that? Can you reconcile tha t? Can you show me mathema tically tha t tha t is

comple tely kosher? Tha t the wall has momen tum 2 mv , it's nonnego tiable.


It must have momen tum, and ye t it has no kinetic energy.


How is tha t possible? Think abou t it, and if you can't solve it, call me a t 3:00 a .m. and I' ll tell you

the so lution .


Okay, now  let's  look a t this from the cen ter-of-mass frame of reference.


The center of mass is very special, and physicis ts love to work in the center of mass for reasons

that you will understand.


In the absence o f any ne t externa l forces on a system as a whole--


as we discussed last time--


the center o f mass w ill always have the same velocity.


We d id a demons tration there with two vibrating objects with a spring , bu t ye t the center o f mass

was moving with a cons tant veloc ity .


The beau ty now  is  if you jump in to the  frame o f the cen ter o f mass--


that means you move with the same velocity o f the cen ter o f mass--


the center o f mass s tands still in your frame o f re ference.


And if the center o f mass s tands still,  the momen tum of the par ticles  in your frame of reference--


in the center-o f-mass frame o f re ference--


is zero.


It is zero be fore the collisions and it is zero after the collisions.


And th is g ives the center o f mass some amazing properties tha t I will discuss w ith you now .


First, we have a particle m1 and we have a particle m2 .


And le t this one in the cen ter-o f-mass frame have a ve locity u1, and this in the center-of-mass

frame has a velocity u2 .


I g ive it specifically u's so that you can separate  the u's from the v's .


The v's are always  in your  frame o f re ference ; the u's are in the frame o f reference o f the cen ter

of mass.


And I take a case whereby I have a comp lete ly e lastic  collision--


that means Q is zero--


the k ind tha t we have just discussed .


Momen tum is no t on ly conserved bu t it is also zero a t a ll momen ts in  time before and a fter the

collision .


After the collision le t's say m2 goes back with velocity u2 prime , and let's say m1 has a velocity

u1 prime .


That's the situa tion a fter the co llision.


Now, I know tha t momen tum is zero , so  I on ly can write down for  this situa tion a fter the collision

that m1 times u1 prime plus m2 times u2 prime must be zero.


I don't write them down as vec tors.


That's no t necessary, because it's a one-dimensional collision and  the signs w ill au tomatically

take care o f the direc tions .


I told you I chose the case of a comple tely elastic collision--


Q is zero--


and so kine tic energy mus t be conserved .


So I have ...


before the collision , I have one-ha lf m1 u1 squared p lus one-half m2 u2 squared , and after the

collision , I have one-half m1 u1 prime squared plus one-half m2 u2 prime squared .


Kine tic energy be fore; kine tic energy afterwards .


Equa tion one; equa tion two .


Nature can so lve tha t quicker than we can, and  the result is amazing.


The resu lt in the cen ter of mass is that u1 prime equals minus u1 and u2 pr ime equals minus u2 .


And that is an amazing resu lt when you think abou t it.


It means tha t in the cen ter o f mass , a ll tha t happens is that the speeds reverse directions, bu t the

speed...


The ve locities reverse direc tions , but the speeds remain the same .


And that is a remarkable, remarkable result.

If you ever wan t to move yourself to the center of mass, you will have to know what the cen ter-o f-

mass velocity  is.


How do we calcula te the velocity of  the center o f mass? So we're dealing here with the cen ter-o f-

mass frame, and now I'm going back to the labora tory frame .


And we know tha t M to tal  times the position vector o f the center o f mass--


this  is the way we de fined it las t time--

equals m1 times the position vector of par ticle 1 plus m2 times the position vector of par ticle 2 . 

And so if you take the derivative o f this equation, then the positions become velocities , so the 
velocity of the center of mass equals  l d ivided by m1 plus m2 , because that's the M to tal which I 
bring under here, and ups tairs I get m1 v1 p lus m2 v2.


And no tice I le ft the arrows o ff because , since it's a one-dimensional problem, s igns w ill take care

of the direc tions .


So th is is the velocity of  the center o f mass.


I wro te it also  there on the blackboard because later on in th is lec ture I will need it, and it is

possible tha t by tha t time I have erased it, and so tha t's why I wrote it down there , too .


So if now you wan t to know what u1 is , so we are...


Now you wan t to know what  the ve locity is  in the cen ter -of-mass frame , tha t, o f course , equals v1

minus the velocity of  the center o f mass and u2 equals  v2 minus the velocity of the cen ter of

mass.


So th is is a way tha t you can trans fer, if you want to , in to the cen ter-o f-mass frame .


And it some times pays off, for reasons tha t I men tioned , tha t the momentum in the cen ter-o f-

mass frame is zero--


always zero before the collision and after the collision , independent of whe ther  it is an elas tic

collision , whether it's an inelas tic co llision or whe ther  it's a superelastic collision .


Now, if you la ter wanted to trans fer back to your  laboratory frame , then , of course, you will have

to add the velocity of the cen ter of mass again to the u1 prime , and you have to add the velocity

of the cen ter o f mass to  the u2 prime.


The ve locity o f the center o f mass has not changed as  seen from your frame of reference,

because the velocity o f center o f mass is always the same, remember, because momen tum is

conserved.


So to ge t into the center-o f-mass frame , you mus t sub tract the velocity o f the cen ter of mass from 
the initial veloc ities. 

To get ou t o f it, you mus t add them. 

Now,  the kine tic energy and the momentum depend on your re ference  frame . 

In general, the  tota l momen tum as seen from your sea ts is no t zero. 

That's only  in a very special case . 

In the case of the cen ter of mass, the  total momen tum is always zero .


The kinetic energy as seen from the lab  frame is certa inly, in general, not  the same as the kine tic

energy from the center-o f-mass frame .


And now comes another unique proper ty o f the cen ter of mass.


If I have a comp letely  inelas tic co llision, then all energy  in the cen ter-of-mass frame is lost.


That's obvious--


in the center-o f-mass frame , remember, momentum is zero.


So you're in the cen ter o f mass .


One particle comes to you and the o ther comes to you .


You're no t moving, you're in the cen ter o f mass .


They get stuck together because it's a comple tely  ine lastic collision .


If they ge t stuck toge ther a fter the collision  they s tand s till.


That means all kine tic energy tha t was there be fore is a ll des troyed , and this kine tic energy--


as observed in the cen ter-of-mass frame--


we call the internal energy , and tha t is the maximum energy in a co llision tha t can ever be

converted in to heat.


And I will show tha t to you partia lly.


I will do some o f the work and I will le t you do some of  the work as we ll.


So I will first calcula te--


in your frame of re ference , where you are sitting--


how much energy  is lost when we have a comple tely  inelastic collis ion.


I will then transfer to the cen ter-of-mass frame, and  I will show you , then , this quite amazing

property.


So now we are back  in 26 .100 , and we're going to make a comp letely inelas tic co llision.


That means they stick together, remember? And m2 , we will have again , to make life a little

simple , no speed , v2 equa ls zero , and m1 has a ve locity v1.


You've seen th is now a zillion times .


They get together, they stick toge ther, and so I have here a ve locity which  I call v prime, and  the

mass is m1 p lus m2 .


That's after the collision .


Momen tum is conserved if there's no ex ternal... ne t ex ternal force on the system, and so I can

write down that m1 v1 must be m1 p lus m2 times v prime.


And so v prime equals m1 v1 divided by m1 plus m2 .


That's a very simple calcula tion.


This, by the way--


it's not so obvious--


is also the velocity of  the center o f mass.


And how can I see tha t so qu ickly? Well, what was the velocity of the center of mass? Here you

have it.


This was in general.


This was no t for the case that v2 was zero ; this was more genera l.


Make v2 zero , and you see exactly tha t you see here the same resu lt, so this mus t be  the velocity

of the cen ter o f mass .


Now we can ca lcula te what  the difference is be tween the po ten tial energy...


the k inetic energy a fter the collision and the kine tic energy before the collis ion.


That is , o f course, someth ing tha t is ra ther trivial.


You know wha t the kine tic energy is be fore the collision--


it's one-half m1 v1 squared--


and you know wha t it is a fter the collision .


I calcu lated v prime , and so you have take half this mass, multiply  it by th is veloc ity squared .


You can do tha t,  I am sure you can do that.


And you will be able to see tha t this equa ls minus ...


and you have to massage the a lgebra a little b it--


minus one-ha lf m1 m2 divided by m1 plus m2 times v1 squared.


That's wha t you will find.


The minus sign is predic table.


We lose kinetic energy when there is a comple tely  inelastic collision .


We've done many  las t lecture .


You lose kine tic energy--


we saw  it in every single case.


That's wha t the minus sign means.


This  is Q.


You lose kinetic energy and  that goes in to hea t.


So you've done your homework now  in the labora tory frame and you are home free--


very well.


Now I'm going to do the same ca lcula tion in the center-of-mass frame .


And I will show you , now--


that's the purpose--


that  this amount o f energy, which is wha t is  los t, that that is all there was to star t w ith in  the

center-of-mass frame, and tha t's a unique property o f the cen ter o f mass .


And so I'm go ing to conver t now, to  transfer you to the center-of-mass frame and then we will

calculate how much energy there was  in the cen ter-o f-mass frame before the co llision, because

after  the co llision there is noth ing .


There is zero .


In the case of a comp letely inelas tic co llision , there is no kine tic energy  left in the cen ter-of-mass

frame.


So we go to the cen ter-of-mass frame .


So we first have  to ca lcula te what u1 is.


Well, u1 equals v1 minus v cen ter of mass.


And we know what v center of mass is--


it's right there.


That's where it is .


And if you do the sub traction , wh ich is by no means d ifficult, you will find m2 divided by m1 p lus

m2 times v1.


And you checked tha t, I hope.


And now we go to calcula te u2 .


We want to know wha t the velocity  is o f the cen ter o f mass of the o ther one .


That, of course, is v2 minus v center o f mass, bu t this was zero.


This m1 divided by m1 plus m2 times v1 , so the d ifference is only the m1 upsta irs and the m2 .


Now we are going  to ca lcula te the kine tic energy  in the center-of-mass frame.


Well, tha t equals one-ha lf of m1 times u1 squared plus one-half m2 times u2 squared .


That's all we have be fore the collision occurs.

Oh , by the way, th is is no t a minus ...


This  is a plus sign and this is a minus sign.


This one comes th is way and this one goes in tha t way.


Now, I can...


I can calculate that  for you .


You know u1 and you know u2 .


If that's a p lus or a minus sign, it makes no difference because they cance l anyhow.


What are you going to find? One-half m1 m2 divided by m1 plus m2 times v1 squared.


And th is is exactly the same  that we had  there.


And so what you see here--


if you a llow me for having skipped some s teps  in the algebra; you will have to do a little

massaging  to get from here to here--


you see here this  is the kine tic energy be fore the collision, and all that kine tic energy  is removed ,

went to hea t.


This  is the maximum you can ever  lose , and this  is wha t we call  the in ternal kine tic energy of the

system.


And so going to the cen ter-o f-mass system, you can a lways immedia tely ca lcula te what  the

maximum heat is tha t you can expec t from a collision .


We can take a very special case , and we can take m2 going to in fin ity .


It's  like having a piece o f putty I slam on the wa ll.


It ge ts stuck, and wha t is the maximum hea t tha t you can produce  tha t's all the energy there is?  If

m2 becomes infinitely h igh , then m1 can be ignored.


m2 cancels m2 , you ge t one-ha lf m1 v1 squared .


And that's obvious .


That's comple tely trivia l.


I have a piece o f putty, I slam it aga inst the wall.


It has a cer tain amoun t of kine tic energy.


Whether you stay  in your re ference  frame or  in the re ference frame o f the center o f mass, it's

immedia tely obvious tha t a ll the kine tic energy  is lost.


And that's exactly wha t you see comes out of  these equations whe ther you go to the cen ter of

mass or whe ther you do it from 26.100 .


I now would like to re turn to the a ir track and do several comp letely  inelas tic co llisions with you.


Again, we have to assume tha t momen tum is conserved.


It never  is complete ly, but we can come close .


And we will have two cars tha t...


Now we're going comple tely  inelastic .


Comple tely  inelastic .


So they hit each o ther and they ge t s tuck.


I ge t a cer tain veloc ity , wh ich I put in to the  first car.


It hits the second car and it gets stuck .


And I see there what my v pr ime is .


I see there on the blackboard.

that if the  two are the same, I have a one here , a one and a one here .


If that's the ra tio , so the outcome is tha t v prime mus t be one-ha lf v1.


So th is must be one-ha lf v1.


Now I have a mass which is half the o ther one.


I p low  it in to the o ther , they get stuck together and now I ge t one divided by one plus two--


I ge t one- third .


Notice in bo th cases I ge t a p lus sign.


That's , o f course, obvious.


If I plow into something and they s tick toge ther,  they continue in the same direction.


And so now I will do the timing in exac tly the same way tha t I did be fore , excep t tha t now I have a

comple tely  ine lastic collision .


I will have a timing  t1 and I will have a timing t prime.


The cars have a sligh tly d ifferen t mass: 237 p lus or minus one gram and I have one tha t is 474

plus or minus one gram--


not too differen t from  this.


I have two of these cars and I have one o f these .


And first I'm going to slam these two onto each o ther , and so when they collide , I expect the

speed to be half.


So I ge t a certain amoun t o f t1--


so t prime will be tw ice as  long because the speed goes down by a factor of  two--


so when I multiply th is number by one-ha lf, I would like  to get that number back.


Here I ge t the  time for this car.


The first one to come in gives me a certain time . 

When they con tinue toge ther, the speed is three times  lower so this time will be three  times 
higher. 

So I multiply th is by one-third and I would like to get  tha t time back. 

And those are  the two experimen ts tha t I would like to do now . 

So we have to ge t the noise back on. 

Air track one. 

[air track humming] 

Air track two .


Here we have the two cars.


They have Velcro , so when they hit each o ther,  they ge t s tuck.


Sometimes they bounce , ac tually.


You have to do the experiment again .


This one goes here; this one goes here.


Are these two timers on? We don' t need this timer anymore .


Are they bo th on? Zero them.


Zero them.


Are they zero? Okay, are you ready? This one is going  to p low  in to this one , they merge and they

continue, and then you'll see the time t pr ime here .


There we go.


Ready...


All r ight.


What do we see?  138, 288 .


138... 288 ...


138...


288, divide this by 2 is 0.144.


That is ...


the difference is only six, and that is only four percen t o ff.


That's comple tely within my predic tion that each time could be o ff by 2Ω percen t.


Now I will have a car which is twice the mass and th is is once the mass.


I will set them aga in to zero and now we get one on to double the mass.


Ready? There we go.


Oh ! You see? They bounced .


They d idn' t stick, so we have to s tart all over .


If they don't stick , o f course, then it's...


it's not a comp lete ly inelas tic co llision .


There we go.


They made a sligh t bounce , which I didn' t like .


Let's see wha t we get.


We can always do it again .


168, 545 .


168 ...


Mu ltiply this by three ...


504 , 545--


eight-percent difference is a little high .


Bu t these th ings can happen .


I told you they bounced, and  I d idn' t like tha t, and then they go t s tuck again .


I will do it once more.


Maybe I'm a little bit luckier.


Again , they bounced a little before they finally merged.


603 , 187.


187 ... 603.


If I divide this by three , I get 0 .201 , and tha t is o ff, again, by about 13 units, abou t seven-percen t

difference , so it's a little b it more than  the five percen t that I allowed for . 

Now, to make it worse for you ton ight, I would like you  to th ink abou t some thing else , not on ly 
about the tenn is ba ll agains t the wall--

whereby the wall has momentum bu t no kine tic energy--

but now I would like you to think abou t th is amazing thing. 

I have e ight billiard ba lls here, and your Newton crad les probably also have eight balls hanging

from pendulums.


This  is easier to demonstra te in 26.100.


Now I le t two ba lls bang onto the other six .


And I know that you predic t what's going  to happen and your prediction is correct.


If you s lam  two balls on to the six nature is going to calculate like mad to conserve momentum, to

conserve kine tic energy closely enough to a comple tely elas tic collision , and ou t comes tha t the

only way that na ture can do it is the fo llowing.


They a ll s tand still and these two take o ff.


Look aga in.


They a ll s tand still and these two take o ff.


That's no t an easy calcula tion.


Bu t now look a t the follow ing .


Hold it--


what happens if I take three and I bang three on the o ther five? Wha t do you pred ict is going to

happen? How many w ill take o ff? Three, you th ink.


You sure?  You were righ t.


Okay.


Now, five .


Five on three .


This  is a tough problem even for na ture.


What do you th ink will happen?


[students respond ]


LEW IN : Five w ill go aga in and three will s tay--


you're good .


If any one o f you can show me analytically that th is is what has to happen, I wou ld love to see

those results .


Okay, see you Wednesday .
