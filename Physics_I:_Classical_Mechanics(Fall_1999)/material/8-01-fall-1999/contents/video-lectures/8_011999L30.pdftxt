8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript – Lecture 30 

Okay, you d id have some problems with physical pendulums , and I wan t to talk a little b it more 
about physical pendulums. 

Let's first look a t the pic ture in very genera l terms.


I have here a solid ob ject, which is ro tating abou t poin t P abou t an axis vertical to the b lackboard ,

and here a t C  is the cen ter of mass.


The objec t has a mass M, and so there is here a force Mg, and let the separation be here b .


I'm going to offse t it over an angle the ta , and I'm going to oscillate it.


Clearly, there has to be a  force a t the pin.


If there were no  force a t the pin, this object wou ld be accelerated down with accelera tion g , and

that's no t what's going to happen.


Bu t I don't care abou t tha t force because I'm going  to take the  torque abou t poin t P.


Remember when we had a spr ing , just a one-dimensional case , we had F equals ma , and that,

for the spring , became minus kx, and the minus sign indicates tha t it's a restoring force.


So we now get someth ing very similar .


In ro ta tion , force becomes torque , mass becomes moment of iner tia , and accelera tion becomes

angular accelera tion .


So now we have minus r cross F, and the minus s ign indicates tha t it is restoring.


So if  I take the torque rela tive to point P, then I have...


This  is the position vector , wh ich has magn itude b .


The force is Mg , and I have to multiply by the sine of  theta.


So I have b times Mg  times the sine of theta and tha t now equals minus ...


I can bring the minus here--


minus the momen t o f iner tia abou t poin t P times alpha, and a lpha is the angu lar acce leration,

which is theta double do t.


I bring them together, and I use the small-angle approximation , small angles.


Then the sine o f the ta is approximately the ta if theta is  in radians.


And so I bring th is all on one side, so I get  the ta double dot plus bMg divided by the momen t of 
inertia about that po int P times the ta--

now this  is my small-angle approxima tion--

equals zero . 

And th is is a well-known equation . 

It is clearly a simple harmon ic oscillation in the ta because th is is a constan t. 

And so we're go ing to ge t as a solu tion that  theta equals the ta maximum--

you can call that the angular amplitude--

times cosine omega t p lus phi. 

This omega is the angular frequency It is a constant. 

Omega here, theta do t, is the angular velocity, which is not a constant. 

The two are comp letely d ifferen t.


That is the angular frequency.


So we know tha t the solu tion to this differential equa tion gives me omega is the square roo t of

this constan t.


So it is bMg d ivided by the moment o f inertia abou t tha t poin t P.


And so the period o f oscilla tion is two pi div ided by omega, and so tha t is two p i times the square

root of I rela tive to po int P d ivided by bMg.


And le t's hang on to th is for a large par t of this lecture because I'm going to apply th is to var ious

geome tries .


Make sure tha t I have it correct--


yes, I do .


This  is independent o f the mass o f the objec t.


Even though you w ill say there is an M here , you will see that in all cases when we ca lcula te the

momen t o f inertia abou t poin t P tha t there is always a mass up here .


So the mass will disappear, as you will see very shortly .


I have four objec ts here , and they all have d ifferen t momen ts o f inertia.


They're a ll going  to ro ta te abou t an axis perpendicular to the b lackboard , so to speak , and we're

going to massage each one of them  to predict their periods.


Let's first go to the rod.


So we first do  the rod.


We have  the rod here.


This  is po int P, and here is the cen ter of the rod .


The rod has mass M and it has  leng th L.


So we have here Mg .


I don't have to worry abou t this anymore.


I simply go to  this equa tion , and I wan t to know what  the period is o f this rod, o f this oscilla ting

rod.


All I have  to know now is wha t is the momen t of inertia about P.


And I know already that b in that equa tion equals one-half L.


So , what is the moment o f inertia o f oscilla tion about po int P? I have to apply now the parallel axis

theorem--


which you also had  to do during the exam--


which says  it is the moment o f inertia of rota tion about  the cen ter o f mass , which, in our case, is

C--


the axes have  to be paralle l, so there is this axis perpendicular to the b lackboard , and this axis

perpendicular to the blackboard--


plus the mass of  the rod times the dis tance between P and c squared--


plus M times this dis tance squared--


so tha t is b squared, and b squared is one-quar ter L squared.


What is the momen t o f inertia for rota tion o f a rod about th is axis? I looked it up in a tab le.


I happen to remember  it now , because I am lecturing 801.


Two mon ths from now,  I will have forgo tten .


So I remember now tha t it is 1 /12 ML squared plus one-quarter ML squared .


That becomes one- third ML squared.


And so the period T becomes two p i times the square root of this momen t o f iner tia , which is the

one-third ML squared , d ivided by bMg , and b is one-half L for this geometry .


So one-ha lf LMg, and no tice , indeed , as I anticipated, you always lose your M, you a lso lose one

L here , and so you ge t two pi times the square roo t of two-thirds L d ivided by g.


So tha t is the period tha t we pred ict for the rod.


So le t's write tha t under here , because we are going to compare them shor tly.


So th is is two pi  times the square root o f two- thirds L d ivided by g .


The rod tha t we have here is designed in such a way that the period is very close  to one second.


That was our goal.


So T is as close as we can ge t it to 1 .00 seconds.


And so if you substitu te in this equa tion T equals one , you will find tha t the leng th of  this rod, if it

is really pivo ting a t the very end, should be about 37 .2 centimeters.


So we did the bes t we can when we made th is rod .


There is always an uncer tain ty, o f course--


how you drill the holes and where you drill  the holes--


so I would say the value tha t we ac tually achieved is 37 .2, probably w ith an uncer tain ty o f abou t

three millime ters, so 0.3 cen timeters .


That's wha t we have .


That is an error o f one part in 370 .


Let's make that...


round tha t o ff.


That's a one-percen t error in the leng th.


Since the leng th is under the square root, the one-percent error becomes half a percent error, so

the period that  I then would predict is abou t 1 .000 p lus half a percent, so tha t is 0 .005 seconds.


So tha t, then , has a one-half-percent error.


So th is is my predic ted period.


And so we're go ing to make ten oscillations o f the observed oscilla tions.


We're go ing to ge t a number.


My reac tion  time is no t much be tter than a ten th of a second.


So we're going to get a number there .


We d ivide th is number by ten .


And so we can always calcula te the period , then , and then we ge t a much improved error o f a

hundredth o f a second, because we will d ivide th is number by ten , so  this also is go ing to be

divided by ten .


And le t's see how close we were able to ge t this to the 1.0 seconds.


So , here is the rod .


Turn this on , the timer .


We'll offset  the rod, and  I will star t it when it s tops somewhere.


Now--

one, two , three, four, five, six, seven , e ight, nine , ten ... not bad . 

9.92--

well w ith in the pred iction. 

9.92 , and so this becomes 0 .992 plus or minus .01 , and you see tha t is well w ith in the pred iction 
that  I made . 

Now, all these four objec ts were designed in such a way tha t they have exactly the same period

of one second.


And now comes the question , how do  the dimensions relate to each o ther  in order to ge t them a

period of one second? So let's now calcula te the period for the o ther three objects : for the ring,

for the disk and for the pendulum.


Let's s tart with the pendulum.


For the pendu lum, center o f mass  is here.


Here is poin t P.


I g ive the pendulum leng th little l--


you see tha t on the righ t blackboard  there.


So b equals  l--


that's the separation between P and C .


The momen t of iner tia about poin t P is very easy now.


This has no mass--


the mass  is a ll here, mass cap ita l M, so that must be M times  l squared .


So I go to this equa tion , and so  I ask , what is the period of a pendulum? And you're no t surprised

that you find two pi  times the square root o f l over g.


We've seen  that be fore , but, of course, it a lso comes out if you do  it in this more complica ted way.


So here we get two p i times the square roo t o f l over g .


Let's now do the ring .


This  is the r ing.


Pivo t about po int P here.


Here is the cen ter of mass righ t in the midd le, in the middle of nowhere .


Right here is the cen ter o f mass. 

And so the dis tance b is the radius of the ring, so we have to calcu late the moment of inertia 
about point P. 

Again, we have to use now the para llel axis theorem. 

It is the moment o f inertia for rota tion about this ax is through poin t C , through a cen ter of mass. 

That is MR squared, if R  is the radius o f the ring . 

All the mass  is a t the circumference, all a t a dis tance R from the center o f mass. 

And then we have to add to that--

according to the para llel axis theorem--

the mass times th is d istance squared , and th is d istance is R , so you ge t MR squared . 

So it is 2MR squared. 

So wha t is the period of an oscillation? I of P,  that is 2MR squared , d ivided by bMg--

b is R--

RMg . 

I lose one R , I lose an M, and we have seen this before . 

I der ived this  in lec ture number 21. 

I remember everyth ing by lec ture number, be lieve it or not. 

So the period, now , is the same as a pendu lum with length two R . 

This  is the r ing. 

And so here we have  two pi times the square roo t o f 2R divided by g . 

I'll make a comparison very shor tly. 

I just wan t to fin ish them all. 

And I now wou ld like to do the d isk, last bu t not leas t. 

For the disk, all we have to do now  is calcula te the momen t o f iner tia . 

This was very close to your... 

the problem you had on the exam. 

So , here you have the d isk, a solid disk.


This  is po int P, this is the center of mass, bu t now it's solid, so again, b is R , the separa tion

between c and b.


And the momen t o f iner tia for rotation abou t poin t P is now the momen t of iner tia for ro tation 
about the cen ter of mass, which you look up in a table--

in the case o f your exam, it was g iven on the front cover--


one-half MR squared .


That's the momen t o f iner tia for rotation abou t the center of mass.


And now we have to add Mb squared, and b equals R , so we have to add MR squared.


So we find three-ha lves MR squared.


So wha t is the period of oscillation? Two pi times three-halves MR squared divided by bMg--


b is R--


RMg , and tha t equals two pi  times the square root...


I lose my M as a lways, I lose an R.


I ge t here three-halves R d ivided by g .


And so let's write tha t down here, so we have two pi times the square roo t of three-halves R

divided by g .


So we have them all four there , and so we can now make a meaning ful comparison .


We want the per iods to be the same , so we can hang on to  those numbers, so we don't need  this

anymore .


We want the per iods to be the same .


We a lready have es tablished tha t the per iod of the rod is close to the one second , so we're no t

going to measure them anymore.


We jus t want  to compare  them--


whether , indeed , they have the same period o f oscilla tion--


by mak ing them oscilla te in unison.


Bu t we wan t to know wha t the rela tive ratios are o f these dimensions the way we designed it.


So le t's first go to the rod, then, and make a comparison be tween the rod and the pendulum.


So if you look at  the rod--


and we use the pendulum as our standard , w ith length little l--


then you see the period will be the same if 1Ω R  is little l...


Oh, sorry, the rod .


If two-thirds capital L is  little l.


So , for the rod , two-thirds L equals  little l, so capital L is 1Ω  l.


It has to be exactly 1Ω  times the leng th of the pendulum, so this  length has to be exac tly 1Ω  times

this  leng th to the cen ter of mass, which is the cen ter o f  that billiard ba ll.


And that's wha t we  tried , to the bes t tha t we cou ld.


So le t's now go to the ring .


For the ring to have the same period, one second , 2R has to be the same as the length o f the

pendulum.


So 2R equals  l, so we can put in here for L , this has to be 1Ω  times l, and here,  this now, which is

2R, has to be l.


Very nonin tuitive , tha t this  leng th here is the same as the diame ter of the r ing.


Not at all obvious.


And so now we go  for the disk.


So now we require that three-halves R, 1Ω R...


We want that to be l, so we wan t R  to be 2 l d ivided by three.


So we want  the diameter 2R  to be 4 l d ivided by three .


And when you look at  the disk, it's hard to see that it is exactly four- thirds, bu t you can see that it

is longer than the pendulum--


it should be one- third longer--


but it is not as  long as the rod because the rod is 1Ω  times the length o f the pendulum, and so we

can now comple te tha t picture .


And we have now tha t the diame ter here--


2R--


is now four-thirds times  l.


And so what we can do now, we can play with them.


We can oscillate them simultaneously and just see how well they track each o ther .


There's no sense in giving you  the dimensions .


The rod was 37 .2 centime ters.


Let me write tha t down , because we calcu lated tha t.


So th is was 37 .2 cen time ters, and I  think tha t translates  in to--


for the pendulum--


24.8 centimeters .


Bu t for the o thers I leave it up to you to calcu late the dimensions .


Yes, 25 ... 24.8 is correct.


So timing is no t usefu l anymore .


Let's  just see how these two go toge ther .


So we offset them, and then we let them go .


And they go pre tty much in unison .


If you wait long enough, of course , you will see there is a difference.


You can never make them exac tly the same, bu t they track each o ther nice ly.


We can now also use the rod and  the disk.


They track each o ther beau tifully .


They're both very close  to 1 .00 seconds .


And we can have the disk versus the pendulum.


And you see they track each o ther very n icely.


Bu t wa it long enough and you will see that, of course, the periods will be differen t.


So , this  is my  last word on physical pendu lums, bu t you may see it again on the  final.


Not maybe--


you can almost coun t on tha t, I'm te lling you .


Okay, I wan t to discuss now some other  in teres ting osc illa tion--


again , simple harmon ic--


and tha t is  liquid in a u-tube, which you see there .


If I have here a tube, which has everywhere ...


it's open on both sides and everywhere the same cross-section, and I put a liqu id in here, in

equilibr ium, just like tha t, and the liquid has mass M.


It has density rho .


The area o f the tube is A, and the length o f the liquid is  l.


So th is is  l.


I'm going to offse t it, the liqu id, and I wanted to see it oscillate , and I wan ted to see whe ther I

could calcu late the period o f the oscillation.


The to tal mass o f the liqu id tha t I have ...


the to tal mass is the volume , which is the area times the length times rho .


I'm going to offse t it so tha t this  is h igher over a dis tance y.


So th is, then, is  lower over a dis tance y.


So th is dis tance is also y , same as tha t.


So the liquid now  is here, and then I release it, and it will start to oscillate.


Well, when it star ts to oscilla te , there comes a time  tha t the liquid , the who le liqu id is go ing to

slosh back and for th and so everywhere in  the tube, the velocity a t any momen t in time will be the

same because the cross-section is no t changing--

it's the same everywhere.


See , if there is a certain ve locity here v, then it's the same as the velocity here , as the velocity

there , as the velocity there.


And that, of course, is y do t.


That's the first deriva tive o f tha t position here.


I'm going to write down the conservation of  tota l energy , mechan ical energy.


I assume that there is no energy  loss, although there probably  is some.


Friction inside the liquid will probably genera te some heat and tha t will cause some damping .


You will see that when we do the experiment.


For now , I will assume that that's no t the case.


So wha t, now , is then the  total energy of the system--


that is , the sum o f the kine tic energy plus the po ten tia l energy? And if we assume tha t that's

constant, we will be able to find the period o f the oscilla tion very shor tly, as you w ill see.


The kinetic energy o f the liquid is easy.


That is one-ha lf M  times the velocity squared, and  the velocity , we agreed, is y do t squared .


Now the potential energy.


I call the po ten tial energy here , I ca ll tha t u equals zero.


When the liquid is s tand ing here and the liquid is stand ing here , I call that po ten tial energy zero.


The mass tha t is now above this  level here , I call that delta M, and delta M is the area  times y

times rho .


This  is how much mass there is here .


It was taken away from here and was put here .


How much work do you have to do to take this  liquid and pu t it there? Well, tha t's the same when

you take this  liqu id and put it here.


And when you bring this  liquid wh ich was there here, then you have moved it up over a dis tance 
y, and so the gravita tional potential energy  increases by delta M--

this  is the amoun t o f mass here--

times g times h , and h is y. 

Mgh , remember? That's the increase in po ten tia l energy. 

And so I move an amoun t of mass which is delta M... 

I move it over a distance y . 

I bring it here , but that makes no difference , o f course.


And so this  is the tota l energy, and this is now a constant.


So I'm going to subs titute in  there the A, l and rho , so I get one-half Al rho veloc ity squared plus A

rho g .


And I ge t a y squared equa ls a constant, because I have a y here and  I have a y there .


We've done this be fore--


this  is the conservation of energy , and in order to find the period o f the simple harmon ic

oscillation , we take the time derivative .


By the way, be fore we do tha t,  this  is... this was delta M and this  is an A, right? Yeah .


A, rho--


yeah, tha t's  it.


So we lose A, we lose rho , and we continue with what we have .


And so we're go ing to  take the deriva tive versus time o f th is equation.


That gives me one-half l.


The two pops ou t, and the two becomes a one, so I get 2y dot, then I apply the chain rule , so  I get

y double do t.


Here I ge t plus g.


The two pops ou t, becomes 2y, and then I get the chain rule , y do t, and  that equals zero .


I lose my y do t, because I have y dot in bo th terms.


This two ea ts up this two .


And so I find tha t y doub le dot plus 2g divided by l times y equals zero , and tha t was my goal,

because this  is clearly a simple harmonic oscillation, because th is is a constan t.


And it'll oscilla te in the following way: y equals y max times the cosine o f omega t p lus phi,  then

this  is the angular frequency , wh ich is direc tly rela ted to the per iod.


Omega, angu lar frequency equals the square root o f 2g over  l, and so the period w ill be two pi 
times the square root o f l over 2g . 

So th is is the per iod for an oscilla ting liquid . 

Notice that it is the period that you would have had ... 

would have obta ined from a pendu lum if the length o f the pendulum were l... l over two--

not at all obv ious, no t a t all in tuitive . 

You see our se tup here .


I have to know what l is, and  that is no t so easy.


Because of  this radius here, if I measure l on  the outside, it's substan tia lly  larger than on  the

inside.


You may no t th ink it's a big d ifference , but it's huge--


it's a nine-centime ter difference between the ou tside and the inside .


If I take the average value be tween the two ...


if I take the average , I find 72 cen timeters, and I could be o ff by one.


If I use th is number for l and  I subs titute it in this equa tion, then I find my predicted per iod , wh ich 
is 1.204, and because o f th is error tha t I have of one , that would give me an uncer tainty of about 
0.01 seconds.


However, before we start measuring it--


and I w ill do ten oscillations to ge t a reasonable , accura te resu lt--


I want to warn you .


I make a prediction--


that  the period  that we will measure will probably be larger than this , and I can think o f two

reasons.


The first is that the damp ing of  this  liquid w ill be huge .


You will see how quickly  it damps .


In the pas t, we have never taken damping into accoun t, and we won't do  that in 801 .


Bu t the damping has the e ffect on mak ing the period longer.


We've always ignored tha t, and in mos t o f the demons trations that we did--


like jus t now--


that was acceptable .


It may no t be acceptable for the liquid .


Bu t now there is a second po int that  I wan t you to th ink about.


Is it correc t tha t I take the average leng th , name ly the average value between the ou ter  leng th

and the inner  length?  I don't think  it is.


I want you to think abou t why that is no t correct.


Look care fully where that l comes  in to my differential equation and you will probab ly come up w ith

the r igh t answer.


And I claim that the ac tual l that we should have  taken is a little bit larger--


I don't know how much larger, bu t it's a little bit larger--


and so that will a lso make the observed per iod become larger than the predic ted one .


So I'm not too optimis tic tha t we will go and hit this the way we wan t to hit it, bu t tha t's good ,

because tha t's where  the physics lies--


that you see tha t there are o ther fac tors tha t have  to be taken in to accoun t.


I'll turn  this one on.


Is it on now? Is  it zeroed?  I'll make it comp letely dark in the classroom, because you're going to

see...


otherwise , you can' t see the liquids.


So you see  the liqu id now.


Oh, you see these equa tions, too .


Okay, it's zeroed .


So , let me try to give this a swing , a large swing.


It damps so enormously that  I rea lly want to ge t a very  large swing .


That's nice .


Now--


one... two...  three...


four... five ... six ...


seven... eigh t... n ine...


Ten! Ah, no t bad .


12.18--


not bad .


We'll get a little bit o f ligh t. 

12.18 .


So observed ...


Ten T observed... is  it 12 .18? Okay, my reaction time is 0.1 .


So T observed is 1 .2 ...


let's make it two plus or minus 0 .01 seconds.


Oh, that's not bad.


It actually ...


there is an overlap.


If you add th is one here , you get one- to-one , and if you subtrac t it here , you ge t also one-to-one .


So it's no t bad.


I expected it to be a little higher, bu t it's c lose enough to be happy .


Think abou t why l should have been taken a little larger .


Now one more very in teresting oscilla tion--


a torsional pendulum.


There's a wire there, 2Ω-me ter s teel wire , and there's hanging someth ing on the bo ttom, which

we're going to offse t, and then it's going to oscilla te back and for th.


That's called a torsional pendulum.


And we're going  to ca lcula te the period o f oscilla tion o f the torsional pendu lum, and they have

wonderfu l properties.


They are in a way  like a spring, like a one-d imensional spring.


Remember the one-dimensional spr ing tha t we had a period wh ich was independent o f the

amplitude? Well, within reason , o f course.


If you make  the amplitude too large,  then you get permanent de formation of the spring.


Bu t you never had to make any small-angle approx ima tion w ith the spring as we had to do with

the pendu lum.


Here is the pendulum, the torsional pendulum.


Here's a bar, and there is a weight here and there's a weight here--


I'll te ll you more abou t tha t la ter.


It's hanging here from the ceiling.


It has a cer tain length l.


This  is po int P.


And we're going  to twis t it and then we are go ing to le t it oscillate--


this bar--


in a horizon tal plane.


So when you look from above, you will see  the bar here--


see point P here--


and then we can o ffset it over an angle the ta, and then  it w ill oscillate back and for th .


The torque relative  to poin t P is now very similar to wha t we had with a spr ing .


We have a minus s ign; again , tha t illus trates that it is restoring .


Instead o f a k now , we have kappa, which is what we call the torsional spring constant, and now

we have an angle wh ich we call the ta.


So we genera te a torque which is propor tiona l to the angle, very similar to the linear spring

whereby we generate a force which is propor tiona l to the linear d isplacemen t.


Now you genera te a torque wh ich is linearly proportional to the ang le.


And th is is the momen t of iner tia abou t poin t P times alpha, and alpha is theta double do t.


So we're going to get that theta double do t p lus kappa times the ta divided by I o f P equa ls zero .


Kappa , by the way, is the torsiona l cons tan t.


So we have a differen tial equa tion.


It's clear tha t you're going to see a simp le harmonic oscilla tion .


This  is a constant, and so you're going to get  the ta equals theta maximum times the cosine

omega  t p lus ph i.


It's getting boring .


This  is the angular frequency , angular frequency...


And angu lar frequency is the square roo t o f kappa divided by the momen t o f inertia abou t poin t P.


And therefore  the period--


which is two p i d ivided by omega--


equals two pi times the square root moment o f inertia about poin t P divided by kappa.


Well... how abou t kappa? Kappa is a function o f the cross-sectional area here A and the leng th l.


And it's also a function o f what kind o f ma teria l you have.


Whether you have stee l or nylon makes a b ig d ifference.


That's very in tuitive , of course.


Remember that in an earlier lec ture when we stressed a wire to  the poin t tha t it was breaking .


We dealt with Young's modulus .


We had a wire and we had a mass hang ing at the end of the wire .


And we discussed the vertical oscilla tion .


We cou ld s tress it and let it go, and  then we would ge t an oscillation, like a spring , and tha t spring

constant  tha t we  found , then , was Young's modu lus times the cross-sectional area here divided

by the length.


And that was k ind of pleasing .


The thicker the bar , the stiffer  it is;  the longer the w ire,  the less stiff it is.


Well, there is some thing very s imilar here, bu t I don' t want to go in to the de tails o f exac tly how

you derive here kappa .


It's a little bit more complica ted .


Bu t indeed , the same is true.


If you make  the wire thicker , then kappa will go up, and if you make the wire longer, kappa will go

down.


That's  immedia tely obvious .


If you have a very short rod and you try to twis t tha t rod ...


It's clamped at the top , and you twis t it and it's very short, you would need a tremendous torque

for ten degrees .


If you make  the wire a hundred meters  long and you want to tw ist it ten degrees , it takes no thing.


So you can immediate ly see that, o f course, the va lue for kappa--


the torsional constan t--


is a func tion o f the leng th .


It will go down when the length goes up .


We have a wire here which is 2Ω me ters long , and the thickness of  the wire,  the diame ter--


according to the manu facturer, it's a piano str ing--


the thickness  is 25/1 ,000 o f an inch.


And if I ca lcula te kappa to the bes t of my ab ility, well, I find tha t kappa should be very close to

four times ten  to the minus four new ton-me ters per radian.


And so a ll we have to do now  is to calcula te the moment o f iner tia of  the sys tem, and then we can 
predict wha t the period o f this pendulum is go ing to be--

which is no t my goal. 

You will see , my goal is going to be a d ifferen t one. 

Look a t the bar and look at the w ire. 

The w ire is so th in tha t the moment o f inertia re lative to poin t P o f the wire is very close to zero. 

Remember , it is proportional to our square . 

Bu t you can forget abou t tha t. 

Almost all momen t o f iner tia is  in this system. 

I'll blow up that system for you--

here it is. 

You'll see it there , and it has on both sides... 

it has 200 grams . 

It has 0.2 kilograms and it has here 0 .2 k ilograms. 

And th is mass is almos t neglig ible . 

And th is d istance here is 30 centime ters and this dis tance is 30 cen time ters. 

So to a very good approximation the moment o f inertia for ro ta tion abou t tha t poin t P--

this ro ta tion--


will be this mass times radius squared p lus this mass times radius squared.


So tha t will be  twice, because I have two masses , times the mass times the radius squared , and

that is abou t 0.036 kilogram me ters squared.


And so when I use tha t into our equation--


so I know now wha t kappa is , at leas t I have a reasonable idea wha t kappa is--


and I know wha t I o f P is--


that's really almos t exclusively determined by that cross-bar--


I will find, then , using tha t equa tion that the period is very close to 60 seconds.


My goal is no t to prove to you that it is close to 60 seconds.


My goal is to show you  tha t for this dimension, which is very thin and very long,  that we can make 
that angle the ta maximum--

this angle--


amazing ly large.


You're no t talking about  ten degrees or 30 degrees.


We can go much further.


And wha t I want  to test with you is how far we can go .


This  is one o f the grea t things in life  for you and  for me--


a challenge : How far can you go and ge t away w ith it? There comes a time that if we make the

angle too large tha t we permanently de form the wire--


it w ill no t come back to its orig inal position .


The same happens w ith a spring .


If you take a spring , it is true that the per iod of oscillation is  independen t of the amplitude but only

up to a po int.


If you go too far, that Hooke's Law no longer holds--


that you de form it permanen tly--


then , o f course, the period will become a func tion o f the extension , and the same is true here.


So if we tw ist it  too much up , then, of course , we will permanen tly deform it, and then the period

will not be independent o f the ta maximum.


Having sa id tha t, I wou ld like to star t asking you for adv ice.


What kind o f angle in th is direction sha ll we s tart with? What do you th ink is reasonab le without

tota l tor ture for the wire? And then we'll write down the  times.


So we're not really in teres ted in tes ting the 60 seconds, but we wou ld ra ther  like to compare the

various ang les tha t we g ive it.


So wha t is the first one we will try? Any  idea?


[echoing class ]: 30 degrees? What? STUDENT: Six p i.


LEW IN : The firs t try?! You are crue l! Man! The first one , you wan t s ix pi?! You're out o f your

mind .


[class laughs]


LEW IN : I'm willing  to go one ro ta tion , okay? You think that's noth ing--


it's peanu ts for you , righ t? Okay, I wou ld like to go theta max imum o f 360 degrees--


so two pi--


and measure the period .


In fact, to measure the per iod takes a minute , and it's not necessary.


We can measure half a period.


Namely , we wa it un til the pendulum stops, and we measure the time until it stops aga in;  tha t's

half a period .


Like with the spring--


if it stops here and it s tops there, that's half a period.


So we'll measure half a period.


Now, I don' t know what my reaction time is going  to be, It may be ano ther ten th of a second ,

because the moment that it s tops  is no t so we ll defined , you will see.


I'm jus t guessing--


probably a little larger than one- tenth o f a second.


Let's g ive it a shot.


Let's try first 360 degrees.


You see,  this  is b lack and  this  is a little red, so we w ill rotate it one rotation.


This  is back here where it was .


Yeah , have you seen  tha t? 360 degrees.


Okay, now,  I will firs t let it go and wa it un til it s tops.


I a lways do  that, and then I star t the time .


And then when it stops again , I'll stop the time , and then we have half a period.


So le t it firs t do its own thing...


very slowly, very gently.


It should  take roughly 30 seconds for half a ro tation.


so you'll see now tha t it...


it's now a t equilibrium again , because we wound it up one ro tation and so back to equ ilibr ium.


And now  it's going to stop very shortly , and when it stops, I want to s tart the timer.


Now! Okay, so now  it goes back, and we'll wait un til it s tops again .


That gives us half a period.


Okay.


Now! 28.75.


28.8 .


What are we going  to do now?


Three ro ta tions? F ive ro ta tions? Three.


Are we in favor of three? Who is responsible  for permanent damage to the wire? Do you accep t

responsibility  in life? Three is a lot.


Three is six pi, man , six .


9I can start it, because it will take a while be fore it s tops.


Three ro ta tions--


first we have to be sure tha t it is more or  less back a t equilibrium, which is a lways a difficult thing ,

because it's so slow .


Yeah , c lose enough .


Okay, three--


shall we go clockwise or counterclockwise? It shou ld make no difference.


I went th is way first; shall we go back? Yeah? You can sleep w ith that? Okay? Okay .


One...  two... three .


Six pi.


The piano wire .


Okay, let's go .


I will star t the timer when it s tops .


We have some time .


Six pi.


If we rota te it six ...


three times , then it w ill rotate six times back be fore it s tops.


I hope you rea lize tha t.


[student speaks up  in background]


LEW IN : Was I too la te? Thank you for pointing tha t out.


So if you rota te it three times and  then le t it go, it goes first three times back, then it's a t

equilibr ium, and then it winds three times up again be fore it stops. 

Notice it's going much faster now , bu t the time--

that's the whole thing--

should be very close to that number again. 

28.5 .


Oh! No t bad.


Shall we now go all the way? Wha t do you wan t to do now? Break the wire or...


Ten ro ta tions?


You'd love to see that, righ t? It will go like mad, ten ro ta tions .


Isn't it amazing how much fas ter  it goes?


[imitates whirring]


It's still 30 seconds.


I must make sure tha t I have my equilibrium.


This was no t equilibrium.


I know  it's somewhere here .


No, it wasn' t equilibrium.


I think th is is  it.


Okay--


ten, right? Ready? One... two... three ... four ...


five... six ... seven...


eight... nine ...


Ten--


poor wire .


We'll le t it go and we'll see wha t happens .


When it stops, I'll s tart the time .


[student speaks up  in background]


LEW IN : Excuse me?


[student repea ts]


LEW IN : Thank you.


Thank you for poin ting that ou t.


Look how fast it's going.


I mean , it's really going wacko.


It has to do all  that in 30 seconds .


Now!


So now  it has to go back to its stopping.


It has to make 20 ro ta tions now , 20 ro tations  in 30 seconds--


ten back to equilibrium and then ten to come to a halt.


This  is go ing to be your Thanksgiving farewe ll demonstration .


Now! 29.2--


fantastic .


Okay, have a good Thanksgiving.
