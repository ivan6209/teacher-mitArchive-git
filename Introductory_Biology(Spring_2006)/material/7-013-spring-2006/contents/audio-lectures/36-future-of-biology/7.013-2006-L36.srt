1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
So this lecture is called the future
of biology.  And I want to associate

2
00:00:19 --> 00:00:23
somewhat freely.
I'm not going to write on the board.

3
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
I am going to post this
presentation so you can pull

4
00:00:27 --> 00:00:32
down stuff from it.
And I think there are two basic

5
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
threads where we're going in biology.
One of them is a basic

6
00:00:36 --> 00:00:41
understanding,
what don't we know about biology?

7
00:00:41 --> 00:00:45
And the second is how are we going
to use that information to go

8
00:00:45 --> 00:00:50
somewhere profound in the future?
So the first one is how life works.

9
00:00:50 --> 00:00:55
And the obvious place to start is
the Human Genome Project.

10
00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
The Human Genome Project was a very
bold initiative that was first

11
00:00:59 --> 00:01:03
spoken about in the late 1980s.
And I remember being at some of the

12
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
first conversations.
I was at the time finishing off my

13
00:01:07 --> 00:01:11
graduate work.
I remember being at some of the

14
00:01:11 --> 00:01:15
first conversations about the Human
Genome Project where the goal was to

15
00:01:15 --> 00:01:19
sequence the human genome,
identify all the genes and DNA,

16
00:01:19 --> 00:01:23
and then use them to do a bunch of
things that I'll talk about in a

17
00:01:23 --> 00:01:27
moment.  And at the time,
I have to say, it seemed like a

18
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
really stupid idea.
It was very difficult to determine

19
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
the sequence of DNA.
It took hours and days and days to

20
00:01:35 --> 00:01:40
read even a thousand base pairs.
And, as you know, we have more than

21
00:01:40 --> 00:01:44
ten to the ninth base pairs.
So the notion of sequencing the

22
00:01:44 --> 00:01:48
entire human genome seemed
incredibly expensive and incredibly

23
00:01:48 --> 00:01:53
stupid.  But that was a reflection,
I think, of my naivety.  And, in

24
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
fact, it's been a very useful
exercise.  Sequencing has gotten

25
00:01:57 --> 00:02:02
better, largely because it had to in
order for this project to succeed.

26
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
And I think there's a real lesson
there.  If something has to happen,

27
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
if you have to get a project done,
there are people,

28
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
you guys, who can make techniques
better and get things done.

29
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
So DNA sequencing is much, much
orders of magnitude faster than it

30
00:02:17 --> 00:02:21
was ten years ago.
And, in fact, this project was

31
00:02:21 --> 00:02:25
initiated in 1990.
The sequencing, per se,

32
00:02:25 --> 00:02:29
was completed a couple of years ago.
But, still, there are many people

33
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
who are looking at the sequence and
trying to figure out what it means.

34
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
Because, as you remember from
everything we've talked about,

35
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
DNA sequence is a code.  And even if
you get three times ten to the ninth

36
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
base pairs of the human genome,
all you've gotten is a code.  And

37
00:02:45 --> 00:02:49
now you have to crack the code.
And we know how to crack the code

38
00:02:49 --> 00:02:53
kind of, that's what we've been
talking about over and over.

39
00:02:53 --> 00:02:57
What does a promoter look like?
What does an RNA look like?  What

40
00:02:57 --> 00:03:02
does a coding region look like?
What are the signals in a coding

41
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
region that tells a protein
synthesis to begin and to end?

42
00:03:06 --> 00:03:11
But when you've just given the,
when you're given this huge mass of

43
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
information that contains maybe 5%
genes and 95% other stuff,

44
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
to actually find the genes in the
human genome from all the sequence

45
00:03:19 --> 00:03:24
data is not trivial.
And so there is still analysis

46
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
going on trying to figure out the
identity of a bunch of genes and

47
00:03:28 --> 00:03:33
indeed the gene number.
And you may notice every now and

48
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
then revised estimates for gene
numbers in the human genome,

49
00:03:37 --> 00:03:41
and it hovers somewhere around 20,
00 to 30,000.  Before the sequence

50
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
was obtained, it was thought that
there were at least 100,

51
00:03:45 --> 00:03:49
00 distinct genes in the genome.
The number came down and down and

52
00:03:49 --> 00:03:53
down.  And now we think they're
somewhere around 25,

53
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57
00 genes.  That's the latest
estimate.  It doesn't really matter.

54
00:03:57 --> 00:04:01
Give or take a few thousand.
But still the Human Genome Project

55
00:04:01 --> 00:04:05
is not complete.
But it's complete enough that many

56
00:04:05 --> 00:04:09
people, including Professor Lander
who is here at MIT who is over at

57
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
the Broad Institute that's being
built across Main Street.

58
00:04:13 --> 00:04:17
If you guys walk up towards the
Stata Center and look across Main

59
00:04:17 --> 00:04:21
Street, there's a new building going
up.  That is the Broad Institute

60
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
that is being organized by Professor
Lander who was instrumental,

61
00:04:25 --> 00:04:30
one of the pivotal people in
sequencing the human genome.

62
00:04:30 --> 00:04:36
And he and others are now doing the
takeoff from the Human Genome

63
00:04:36 --> 00:04:42
Project, and it goes like this.
Basically describe everything else

64
00:04:42 --> 00:04:48
about molecular biology.
And it's a daunting list of what

65
00:04:48 --> 00:04:54
people want to do.
Find all the RNAs,

66
00:04:54 --> 00:05:00
all the proteins in every cell type
at every time during a cell's life.

67
00:05:00 --> 00:05:04
Figure out all the DNA-protein
interactions, so all the

68
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
transcription factors that bind to
DNA.  Figure out all the proteins

69
00:05:08 --> 00:05:12
that bind to RNA and might regulate
their translation or might regulate

70
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
their stability.
Figure out all the protein-protein

71
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
interactions, all those enzyme
complexes, all those proteins that

72
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
interact in all those signal
transduction cascades you've been

73
00:05:24 --> 00:05:29
talking about.
We have no idea what all the

74
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
protein-protein interactions that go
on in every cell at every point in a

75
00:05:33 --> 00:05:37
cell's life are.
All the signal transduction events.

76
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
All the regulatory circuits.  I'll
talk more about that in a moment.

77
00:05:41 --> 00:05:45
All gene function.  All diseased
genes.  This is an enormous list.

78
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
It's going to take decades of many
people to get through this list and

79
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
get all this information.
And, of course, in the end this is

80
00:05:53 --> 00:05:58
just information.
And you have to do something with it

81
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
and put it together so that you do
land up with understanding gene

82
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
function and being able to build
circuits of the kind that

83
00:06:06 --> 00:06:11
bioengineers like to do.
One thing I want to point out for

84
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
those of you who are interested in
computer science.

85
00:06:15 --> 00:06:20
One of the things that has come out
of the Human Genome Project is a lot

86
00:06:20 --> 00:06:24
of data, but it's actually not that
much data.  It's a few terabytes.

87
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
OK?  So 80,000 CDs will store all
the information coming from the

88
00:06:28 --> 00:06:33
Human Genome Project.
But that's just DNA sequence.

89
00:06:33 --> 00:06:37
OK?  If you're starting to look at
protein-protein interaction,

90
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41
all the RNAs, everything that I just
went through on that list,

91
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
we're talking about billions and
billions and probably trillions of

92
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
terabytes.  Where is that
information going to go?

93
00:06:49 --> 00:06:53
Is there a good way to store the
information now?

94
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
There probably ought to be some
real reevaluation of data storage.

95
00:06:57 --> 00:07:01
And there is.  There is some
interesting work being done to try

96
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
to figure out how to store and how
to access the information that's

97
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09
going to come out of the follow-up
of the Human Genome Project.

98
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
How do you find proteins that are
present in all cells at different

99
00:07:13 --> 00:07:17
times in a cell life?
So here's a piece of real data.

100
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
In the study of proteomics the
notion is to look for proteins that

101
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
are present in one cell type and not
in another cell type.

102
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
This is a technique that you know,
gel electrophoresis.  It's called

103
00:07:29 --> 00:07:34
2-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
In the first dimension you separate

104
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
proteins by charge.
And then you actually turn your gel

105
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
around, rerun it and separate
proteins according to their size.

106
00:07:43 --> 00:07:47
And what you get are a
constellation of spots,

107
00:07:47 --> 00:07:52
each of which represents a protein.
And you can look at the spectrum of

108
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
proteins from one cell type and from
another cell type and ask what's

109
00:07:56 --> 00:08:01
different and what's similar between
the two cell types.

110
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
So, for example,
this arrow up here.

111
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
Actually, let's look at this one.
In this cell type one there's one,

112
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
two, three spots that are in the
circle and an arrow pointing to

113
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
nothing.  If you look at cell type
two, here are one,

114
00:08:15 --> 00:08:19
two, three, the same spots.
And here one, two, three.  And here

115
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
the arrow is pointing to another
spot which is a protein that's

116
00:08:22 --> 00:08:26
present in cell type two and not
cell type one.

117
00:08:26 --> 00:08:30
And this kind of method is the way
that people are figuring out which

118
00:08:30 --> 00:08:34
proteins are present
in which cell type.

119
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
What you can do now is to actually
cut this little spot out of the gel

120
00:08:38 --> 00:08:42
of cell type two,
put it through the mass spec and

121
00:08:42 --> 00:08:47
figure out the identify of that
protein.  So you can do this stuff.

122
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
It's just a lot of work.  And there
are more sophisticated methods than

123
00:08:51 --> 00:08:56
this to go about finding all the
proteins, but basically you have to

124
00:08:56 --> 00:09:00
look and you have to identify the
protein.  And then you have to store

125
00:09:00 --> 00:09:05
that data and use it somehow.
Here's something else that's being

126
00:09:05 --> 00:09:10
done by Professor Young at MIT.
Professor Young is trying to figure

127
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
out all the regulatory networks
between all the genes in yeast.

128
00:09:14 --> 00:09:19
So yeast is a small organism.  It
has just a few thousand genes.

129
00:09:19 --> 00:09:24
And it has actually just a few
hundred transcription factors.

130
00:09:24 --> 00:09:29
And their names are arrayed around
the outside of the circle.

131
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
And what he's done,
using various techniques,

132
00:09:33 --> 00:09:38
is to figure out which transcription
factor activates the expression or

133
00:09:38 --> 00:09:43
changes the activity of which other
transcription factor.

134
00:09:43 --> 00:09:48
And so every arrow indicates that
there is some kind of interaction

135
00:09:48 --> 00:09:53
between these different
transcription factors.

136
00:09:53 --> 00:09:58
And this gives a kind of regulatory
network of the circuitry involved in

137
00:09:58 --> 00:10:03
controlling yeast transcription.
Now, yeast is a single cell with

138
00:10:03 --> 00:10:07
very few genes.
We are, as you know,

139
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
multicellular organisms with many
genes.  And so the regulatory maps

140
00:10:11 --> 00:10:16
for humans are going to look many,
many orders of magnitude more

141
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
complex than this one.
That's where we're going.

142
00:10:20 --> 00:10:24
And part of going there is using
computational biology.

143
00:10:24 --> 00:10:29
One of the things that there is
focus on in a number of departments

144
00:10:29 --> 00:10:33
at MIT, including Course 7.
, is the question of computational

145
00:10:33 --> 00:10:38
biology or that include
systems biology.

146
00:10:38 --> 00:10:42
And how can you use computational
methods to work together with real

147
00:10:42 --> 00:10:47
data to predict these circuits,
to describe these very, very complex

148
00:10:47 --> 00:10:52
circuits, to describe the circuit of
life?  And I can tell you something.

149
00:10:52 --> 00:10:56
It sounds as though it's a doable
task, and in theory it is,

150
00:10:56 --> 00:11:01
but actually we are not able to
describe the circuit of life for

151
00:11:01 --> 00:11:06
even the simple viruses.
So there is a virus called phage

152
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
Lambda that's been mentioned to you.
It has been studied for many, many,

153
00:11:10 --> 00:11:15
many decades.  And we know about its
lifecycle in great detail.

154
00:11:15 --> 00:11:19
It doesn't have that many genes.
We know which genes turn on and off.

155
00:11:19 --> 00:11:24
And yet we still don't have a
completely reliable computer model

156
00:11:24 --> 00:11:29
of how this phage responds to
various environmental inputs.

157
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
We don't quite know when it's going
to lyse the cell or when it's going

158
00:11:32 --> 00:11:36
to incorporate into the bacterial
cell chromosome.

159
00:11:36 --> 00:11:40
We don't even have a complete
computational description for a

160
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
simple virus.  So to get it for a
cell is a daunting task.

161
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
And this is where computational
biology is going to have to work

162
00:11:47 --> 00:11:51
with the real data and where you
guys come in to try to bring things

163
00:11:51 --> 00:11:55
together so we can actually get
reasonable equations of life.

164
00:11:55 --> 00:11:59
Here's an equation that I took from
one of my colleagues,

165
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
Professor Eric Davidson who is at
Caltech, who has been working with

166
00:12:03 --> 00:12:07
someone else to look at one of the
regulatory circuits in drosophila.

167
00:12:07 --> 00:12:11
And again this is just the tip of
the iceberg of gene interactions.

168
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
You can look at this on the
PowerPoint later.

169
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19
These are gene interactions,
and this is just a little bit of the

170
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
circuitry that sets up a little bit
of the body plan in the fruit fly

171
00:12:23 --> 00:12:28
drosophila.  Here's another frontier
of biology.  Imaging.

172
00:12:28 --> 00:12:31
Imaging in biology is fantastic
right now.  So we can do stuff like

173
00:12:31 --> 00:12:35
look at fish that has got its red
blood cells fluorescently labeled.

174
00:12:35 --> 00:12:39
And we can actually see in
real-time the movement of the red

175
00:12:39 --> 00:12:43
blood cells through the different
parts of the body.

176
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
We can put various drugs on the
fish.  We can use various fish

177
00:12:46 --> 00:12:50
mutants that are defective in
components of the extracellular

178
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
matrix, for example,
or some other aspect of the animal

179
00:12:54 --> 00:12:58
that might control red blood cell
movement or function.

180
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
And we can look in real-time at what
happens to the animal.

181
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
This works great in fish,
but it's only the beginning because

182
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
there are things we still cannot see
clearly enough,

183
00:13:09 --> 00:13:13
even in fish which are transparent.
So these methods work well.  The

184
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
challenges become very great in
mammals where development occurs

185
00:13:17 --> 00:13:21
inside the mother and where the
animal is opaque.

186
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
And how do you actually follow
single cells through the animal as

187
00:13:25 --> 00:13:29
they're doing whatever
they're doing?

188
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
So, for example,
if one wants to know what happens to

189
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
a cancer cell when it's introduced
into an animal,

190
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
does it go directly to the place
where it's going to make a tumor or

191
00:13:38 --> 00:13:41
does it wander around the body until
it actually finds where it's going?

192
00:13:41 --> 00:13:45
You have to be able to image single
cells in a very profound way.

193
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
And this is one of the current
frontiers of biology.

194
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
But then you can go deeper down
into the cell.

195
00:13:51 --> 00:13:54
You can expand that by a few orders
of magnitude and say,

196
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
well, it's not just looking at the
outside of the cell.

197
00:13:58 --> 00:14:02
You really want to be looking inside
the cell in real-time to see

198
00:14:02 --> 00:14:06
proteins interacting,
to see transcription happening in

199
00:14:06 --> 00:14:10
real-time in the cell.
It's not quite clear how to do that

200
00:14:10 --> 00:14:14
right now.  It's a combination of
physics.  So if you're thinking of a

201
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
Course 8.0 major,
this is something you might think

202
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
about.  It's a combination of
physics and biology.

203
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
How do you get imaging on a
resolution high enough that you can

204
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
look in real-time at these events
that are occurring in a cell?

205
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
Fascinating problem.
Neurobiology we touched on.

206
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
Where is neurobiology going?
Well, lots of places.  How do you

207
00:14:37 --> 00:14:41
make the brain?
We have no idea how you construct

208
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
the 3-dimensional brain.
And we don't understand the

209
00:14:45 --> 00:14:49
significance of the 3-dimensional
structure of the brain.

210
00:14:49 --> 00:14:53
In neurobiology we talked about the
circuitry in the brain and about the

211
00:14:53 --> 00:14:57
billions and billions of circuits
that there are in the brain,

212
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
probably ten to the fifteenth
circuits within the brain itself.

213
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
How on earth are we going to
actually figure out that circuitry?

214
00:15:05 --> 00:15:09
I have no idea.  I have no idea
what we can do in the mammalian

215
00:15:09 --> 00:15:13
brain.  We cannot even do it
properly in something fairly simple

216
00:15:13 --> 00:15:18
like the fruit fly,
so how are we going to do it in the

217
00:15:18 --> 00:15:22
human brain?  This is a real
frontier of biology that,

218
00:15:22 --> 00:15:26
again, brings together multiple
disciplines; physics,

219
00:15:26 --> 00:15:31
biology, brain and cognitive science.
What's the molecular basis for

220
00:15:31 --> 00:15:35
thought and how can we think about
ourselves thinking about ourselves

221
00:15:35 --> 00:15:40
thinking about ourselves?
What does that mean?  OK?

222
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
You've had one test on action
potentials.  You know about synapses.

223
00:15:44 --> 00:15:48
It's got something to do with
channels and synapses,

224
00:15:48 --> 00:15:53
right?  But what goes beyond there?
How does it come back to something

225
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
that allows us to think in such
complex ways?  Here's one.

226
00:15:57 --> 00:16:02
Why do we sleep?
Simple question.

227
00:16:02 --> 00:16:06
We sleep.  You have to sleep.
If you don't sleep, this is

228
00:16:06 --> 00:16:10
something for you guys to bear in
mind.  If you don't sleep,

229
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
after two weeks you will drop dead.
That is true of rats.  If you

230
00:16:14 --> 00:16:18
prevent a rat sleeping for two weeks
it drops dead.

231
00:16:18 --> 00:16:22
There is something that happens
during sleep, and it's not clear

232
00:16:22 --> 00:16:26
what, it's really not clear what.
It's thought that it might be some

233
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
kind of metabolic restoration of the
brain that maybe you run out of some

234
00:16:30 --> 00:16:34
essential components that you need
in order to get normal circuitry.

235
00:16:34 --> 00:16:37
But you literally have to sleep or
you will die.  But we don't know why.

236
00:16:37 --> 00:16:40
OK?  So that's a frontier that is
particularly interesting.

237
00:16:40 --> 00:16:44
OK.  This is work I wanted to show
you from my own laboratory.

238
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
We're interested in the
3-dimensional structure of the brain

239
00:16:47 --> 00:16:51
and why you have a 3-dimensional
structure and how you make the

240
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
3-dimensional structure.
We're looking in the zebra fish.

241
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
This is a normal zebra fish brain.
And you can see it's got these

242
00:16:57 --> 00:17:01
three red regions,
which are actually cavities in the

243
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
brain.
And then this is a whole series of

244
00:17:04 --> 00:17:08
mutant fish we've isolated that have
got really messed up brains.

245
00:17:08 --> 00:17:12
They turn out to be really messed
up animals.  They've got abnormal

246
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
behavior, their neurons grow in the
wrong place, and there's something

247
00:17:16 --> 00:17:20
profoundly wrong with both the
architecture of the brain and the

248
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
function of the brain.
This is one kind of approach we can

249
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
take but, in fact this is asking a
rather simple question.

250
00:17:28 --> 00:17:32
It's not asking the question of how
the zebra fish thinks about

251
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
itself, if it does.
OK.  Oh, so what I'd like to do in

252
00:17:36 --> 00:17:40
the last lecture also is to point
you in the direction of relevant

253
00:17:40 --> 00:17:44
movies, some of which you'll have
heard of and some of which you won't.

254
00:17:44 --> 00:17:48
This is one you've probably heard
of because it's a new one.

255
00:17:48 --> 00:17:52
So I particularly liked this movie
with respect to neurobiology because,

256
00:17:52 --> 00:17:56
actually, I didn't like this movie.
I thought it was a really

257
00:17:56 --> 00:18:00
depressing movie,
but the part that I thought was

258
00:18:00 --> 00:18:04
really relevant to this class is
that there is a company called

259
00:18:04 --> 00:18:08
Lacuna Incorporated that will go in
and selectively erase memories from

260
00:18:08 --> 00:18:12
your memory banks.
And they actually can plug in,

261
00:18:12 --> 00:18:15
you know, they put a thing on your
head with electrodes coming out.

262
00:18:15 --> 00:18:19
And then they have a TV monitor.
And they can actually see the

263
00:18:19 --> 00:18:22
circuits that correspond to a
particular memory.

264
00:18:22 --> 00:18:25
And then they hit the erase button
or the delete button and that memory

265
00:18:25 --> 00:18:29
goes.  And this movie is about this
guy, you look in so

266
00:18:29 --> 00:18:32
pain, Dr. Gardel.
This movie is about this guy,

267
00:18:32 --> 00:18:36
Jim Carey, who is trying not to be
erased.  Anyway,

268
00:18:36 --> 00:18:39
it's very interesting because I
thought, gee, will there ever come a

269
00:18:39 --> 00:18:43
time when we actually can have a TV
screen and we actually can see the

270
00:18:43 --> 00:18:47
circuits that correspond to a
particular memory?

271
00:18:47 --> 00:18:50
So see it if for no other reason.
OK, here we go, basic understanding.

272
00:18:50 --> 00:18:54
Something we have not talked much
about in this course but is really

273
00:18:54 --> 00:18:58
very important with regard to the
future of biology is evolution.

274
00:18:58 --> 00:19:02
What does evolution mean,
especially in molecular terms?

275
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
And I actually wanted to throw this
out at you because this is in the

276
00:19:06 --> 00:19:10
news presently,
this term "intelligent design" and

277
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
the contrast to evolution.
I think that you guys, even now but

278
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
certainly as you develop and go
through MIT, really become

279
00:19:18 --> 00:19:22
spokespeople for science and become
commentators on current issues in

280
00:19:22 --> 00:19:26
science.  And I think you really
should be aware of some current

281
00:19:26 --> 00:19:31
issues, so I'm throwing this out at
your to increase your awareness.

282
00:19:31 --> 00:19:34
There is a term floating around
called "intelligent design" which is

283
00:19:34 --> 00:19:38
sort of, I would say,
an extension of creationism where

284
00:19:38 --> 00:19:42
the sense is that things are just so
complex and so interesting and seem

285
00:19:42 --> 00:19:46
to be so well designed that how
could this have happened by the

286
00:19:46 --> 00:19:50
process of evolution?
And so if you look in the news,

287
00:19:50 --> 00:19:54
if you do a Google news or if you
just look in the newspapers,

288
00:19:54 --> 00:19:58
you'll see there are raging
controversies about the notion of

289
00:19:58 --> 00:20:02
intelligent design versus evolution
around the country.

290
00:20:02 --> 00:20:06
And indeed evolution is complex,
and we cannot explain how everything

291
00:20:06 --> 00:20:10
occurs.  This is a picture of
Darwin's finches,

292
00:20:10 --> 00:20:14
the thing that got him thinking
about evolution.

293
00:20:14 --> 00:20:19
These finches that live in the
Galapagos Islands and are believed

294
00:20:19 --> 00:20:23
to have arisen from a single pair of
finches that the wind blew astray

295
00:20:23 --> 00:20:27
about 100,000 years ago.
And that turned into a bunch of

296
00:20:27 --> 00:20:31
different species that can be picked
out by their head shape

297
00:20:31 --> 00:20:36
and their beak size.
And it's really not clear how you

298
00:20:36 --> 00:20:41
actually got this set of different
beak shapes and head size.

299
00:20:41 --> 00:20:46
The sense of selection for
particular beaks that allowed the

300
00:20:46 --> 00:20:52
birds to eat particular foods and so
on is a very compelling one.

301
00:20:52 --> 00:20:57
And there certainly is no doubt in
my mind, or I would say in most

302
00:20:57 --> 00:21:02
people's mind who work in biology,
that natural selection and evolution

303
00:21:02 --> 00:21:07
is the way to go.
But I want to raise with you an

304
00:21:07 --> 00:21:11
interesting question and then I want
to tell you about a new paper that I

305
00:21:11 --> 00:21:16
read concerning natural selection.
So natural selection leading to

306
00:21:16 --> 00:21:20
evolution is thought to act on three
different kinds of changes in DNA.

307
00:21:20 --> 00:21:25
Single based mutations, you
remember those,

308
00:21:25 --> 00:21:30
frame shifts, missense,
nonsense mutations and so on.

309
00:21:30 --> 00:21:34
Cis-regulatory mutations,
those refer to mutations in the

310
00:21:34 --> 00:21:38
promoter regions of genes.
So those would change the

311
00:21:38 --> 00:21:42
transcription of a gene.
A single base mutation would change

312
00:21:42 --> 00:21:47
whether a protein is made and what
the actual sequence of the protein

313
00:21:47 --> 00:21:51
is and therefore its potential
function.  The cis-regulatory

314
00:21:51 --> 00:21:55
mutations would change how much of a
message was made, how much

315
00:21:55 --> 00:22:00
of a protein was made.
And here's one that you've touched

316
00:22:00 --> 00:22:04
on a bit, but I want to touch on a
bit more, which is the repeat number

317
00:22:04 --> 00:22:08
of motifs within one coding sequence.
So what am I talking about?

318
00:22:08 --> 00:22:12
Well, I'll tell you what I'm
talking about.

319
00:22:12 --> 00:22:16
And I'll use it to describe the
example of dog evolution.

320
00:22:16 --> 00:22:20
So dogs are really different from
one another.  They're

321
00:22:20 --> 00:22:24
extraordinarily different from one
another.  If you look at their size

322
00:22:24 --> 00:22:28
and their actual faces and the bones
of their face,

323
00:22:28 --> 00:22:32
the shapes of the bones,
the size of the snout and so on are

324
00:22:32 --> 00:22:36
really different.
You know, not only are they cute,

325
00:22:36 --> 00:22:40
but they're really different from
one another.  OK.

326
00:22:40 --> 00:22:45
And if you actually look,
over the past 150 years, there has

327
00:22:45 --> 00:22:49
been a huge increase in the number
of breeds and a huge increase in the

328
00:22:49 --> 00:22:54
changes that you see in dog facial
skeleton.  Now,

329
00:22:54 --> 00:22:59
this bothers people who think about
evolution.

330
00:22:59 --> 00:23:04
Because if you look at the number of
single based mutations that are

331
00:23:04 --> 00:23:09
around in coding sequences,
it would not seem to be enough to

332
00:23:09 --> 00:23:14
accomplish these rapid changes in
dog morphology.

333
00:23:14 --> 00:23:19
And so a very interesting paper
came out last year that will lead to

334
00:23:19 --> 00:23:24
a conclusion I'll tell you a moment.
The conclusion has to do with

335
00:23:24 --> 00:23:30
variations in the number of motif
repeats within a protein.

336
00:23:30 --> 00:23:34
So what am I talking about?
So forget this.  This is actually

337
00:23:34 --> 00:23:38
on your handout.
So if you look at,

338
00:23:38 --> 00:23:43
I did give you a handout and I
haven't been referring to it,

339
00:23:43 --> 00:23:47
but this in fact is number seven on
your handout.  So if you look at

340
00:23:47 --> 00:23:52
protein A and allele A of protein A
or allele B of protein A,

341
00:23:52 --> 00:23:56
they may differ in the following way.
In protein A there may be a small

342
00:23:56 --> 00:24:01
amino acid stretch that is repeated
a couple of times.

343
00:24:01 --> 00:24:04
It could be directly contiguous or
it could be a little far apart from

344
00:24:04 --> 00:24:08
each other.  And then if you look at
allele B of protein A,

345
00:24:08 --> 00:24:12
you might have five copies of that
repeat sequence.

346
00:24:12 --> 00:24:16
And, in fact, that change in number
of copies of a particular part of a

347
00:24:16 --> 00:24:20
protein can profoundly change the
function of the protein.

348
00:24:20 --> 00:24:24
It can change confirmation.
It can change enzymatic activity.

349
00:24:24 --> 00:24:28
It can change localization in the
cell.  It can change stability of

350
00:24:28 --> 00:24:32
the protein and so on.
These repeats and variation in the

351
00:24:32 --> 00:24:37
number of repeats are actually very
easy to get.  They are about 100,

352
00:24:37 --> 00:24:42
00 times more frequent than point
mutations if you look in genomes.

353
00:24:42 --> 00:24:46
And they occur during recombination
where the DNA sequences might

354
00:24:46 --> 00:24:51
misalign with one another.
And I'm not going to get into this

355
00:24:51 --> 00:24:56
now, but if you want to come ask me
later I'll email you.  We

356
00:24:56 --> 00:25:01
can go into this more.
But they occur because the DNA

357
00:25:01 --> 00:25:05
sequences don't quite align properly
during recombination,

358
00:25:05 --> 00:25:10
and you get the protein changing a
bit with respect to these repeat

359
00:25:10 --> 00:25:14
sequences.  And so Fondon and Garner
looked at 92 breeds of dogs,

360
00:25:14 --> 00:25:19
and they looked in 17 genes that
they thought might important in

361
00:25:19 --> 00:25:23
shaping the facial skeleton because
we know what those genes are.

362
00:25:23 --> 00:25:28
And they found, very interestingly,
that these 17 genes had 37 repeat

363
00:25:28 --> 00:25:32
regions amongst them which is
actually much higher than you find

364
00:25:32 --> 00:25:37
in just your general
spread of genes.

365
00:25:37 --> 00:25:41
And when they looked from breed to
breed they found there was a huge

366
00:25:41 --> 00:25:45
variation in the numbers of repeats
in different genes from one breed of

367
00:25:45 --> 00:25:50
dog to another breed of dog.
Now, I don't know really what this

368
00:25:50 --> 00:25:54
means.  It's very interesting
potentially for looking at how

369
00:25:54 --> 00:25:59
breeds of dogs have evolved or how
we have forced their evolution.

370
00:25:59 --> 00:26:03
Does this have something to do
profoundly with evolution and

371
00:26:03 --> 00:26:07
changes in form in general?
Don't know that.  But it's

372
00:26:07 --> 00:26:11
something that you should be aware
of as you go on because it's a

373
00:26:11 --> 00:26:16
slightly different way to think
about how rapid evolution can occur.

374
00:26:16 --> 00:26:20
OK.  Clinical understanding.
Disease taxonomy,

375
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
you've talked a bit about this in
cancer.  Over the last few decades

376
00:26:24 --> 00:26:28
there has been an enormous increase
in the number of genes that can be

377
00:26:28 --> 00:26:33
assigned to be associated with a
particular disease.

378
00:26:33 --> 00:26:36
And my chart here only goes up to
2002.  It would probably be

379
00:26:36 --> 00:26:40
somewhere out here on the roof for
2005.  How do you do this?

380
00:26:40 --> 00:26:44
Well, this is where the Humane
Genome Project comes in.

381
00:26:44 --> 00:26:47
One can look.  And each of these
squares represents a gene and its

382
00:26:47 --> 00:26:51
expression, and the level of
expression is proportional to the

383
00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
color or is associated with the
color.  It doesn't matter which.

384
00:26:55 --> 00:26:59
But you can look in different
cancers.

385
00:26:59 --> 00:27:02
And each of these lines is a cancer.
And you can look at different genes.

386
00:27:02 --> 00:27:06
And you can see that different
tumors have got different patterns

387
00:27:06 --> 00:27:10
of gene expression.
And you can use those patterns of

388
00:27:10 --> 00:27:14
gene expression to classify the
tumors.  And this has been done by

389
00:27:14 --> 00:27:18
Professor Lander and Dr.
Golub over at the Genome Center.

390
00:27:18 --> 00:27:22
So, for example, in acute
lymphocytic leukemia,

391
00:27:22 --> 00:27:26
you can see one pattern of gene
expression.  Again,

392
00:27:26 --> 00:27:30
each of these squares represents a
gene and the color represents the

393
00:27:30 --> 00:27:33
level of expression of the gene.
And you can see in acute myelogenous

394
00:27:33 --> 00:27:37
leukemia there's a completely
different pattern of expression.

395
00:27:37 --> 00:27:41
This is fantastic because it starts
to allow you to classify a disease

396
00:27:41 --> 00:27:44
in molecular detail.
The old way of pathologists looking

397
00:27:44 --> 00:27:48
at diseases, looking at cells and
trying to classify both cancers and

398
00:27:48 --> 00:27:52
other disorders on the basis of
morphology of cells and of staining

399
00:27:52 --> 00:27:56
of cells is actually not that
precise.  It's much better

400
00:27:56 --> 00:28:00
than nothing.
But being able to do it at a

401
00:28:00 --> 00:28:05
molecular level really lets you know
what disease you're dealing with and

402
00:28:05 --> 00:28:10
what spectrum of drugs might be
appropriate to treat that disorder.

403
00:28:10 --> 00:28:14
And so that segues nicely into the
future of prediction.

404
00:28:14 --> 00:28:19
What can we predict in biology?
So here are a couple.  Will your

405
00:28:19 --> 00:28:24
specific disorder respond to
particular drugs?

406
00:28:24 --> 00:28:29
If you have acute Lymphocytic
leukemia, will it respond to a

407
00:28:29 --> 00:28:34
particular spectrum of drugs?
And if you have a particular variant

408
00:28:34 --> 00:28:38
of acute Lymphocytic leukemia,
will it respond to particular

409
00:28:38 --> 00:28:43
variants of drugs?
We're already on the cusp of

410
00:28:43 --> 00:28:47
classifying cancers in a way that
you can give a particular spectrum

411
00:28:47 --> 00:28:51
of drugs for a particular kind of
cancer.  And this is really going to

412
00:28:51 --> 00:28:56
escalate to everything.
There is almost no disorder that is

413
00:28:56 --> 00:29:00
treatable by medication that where
different people are not sensitive

414
00:29:00 --> 00:29:05
at different levels to a
particular medication.

415
00:29:05 --> 00:29:08
So some people might respond very
well and some people might respond

416
00:29:08 --> 00:29:12
very poorly, not just in cancer but
in almost all disorders.

417
00:29:12 --> 00:29:15
In the future, and I think it's
going to be in the near future,

418
00:29:15 --> 00:29:19
really in the next few years, I
think it's going to be possible to

419
00:29:19 --> 00:29:22
say what specific disorder do you
have and should you be taking this

420
00:29:22 --> 00:29:26
particular combination of drugs?
And here's another one.  Are you

421
00:29:26 --> 00:29:30
genetically predetermined to get a
specific disease?

422
00:29:30 --> 00:29:34
That's a really tough one.
Maybe you want to know.  Maybe you

423
00:29:34 --> 00:29:38
don't want to know.
We'll come to that to in a moment.

424
00:29:38 --> 00:29:42
Here's a movie that I particularly
liked that has to do with predicting

425
00:29:42 --> 00:29:46
who you're going to be and what
you're going to get or not get.

426
00:29:46 --> 00:29:50
And it's called Gattaca.  You guys
may or may not have seen it,

427
00:29:50 --> 00:29:54
or used to see it long ago.  Have
you guys seen Gattaca?

428
00:29:54 --> 00:29:58
Yes.  OK.  Good.  Fine.
I'm not that far out.  I was trying

429
00:29:58 --> 00:30:02
to gauge your level here.
I liked that.  I particularly liked

430
00:30:02 --> 00:30:07
“there is no gene for the human
spirit”.  So Gattaca falls into the

431
00:30:07 --> 00:30:12
prediction aegis quite well.
I next few years, and I would say

432
00:30:12 --> 00:30:18
within ten years easy,
you are going to be about to get

433
00:30:18 --> 00:30:23
your personal DNA profile,
including information about the

434
00:30:23 --> 00:30:28
approximately 1,
00 bad alleles of genes that we all

435
00:30:28 --> 00:30:32
carry.  So that's good, I guess.
And that's bad.

436
00:30:32 --> 00:30:35
Do you want this information?
Do you want to know what you're

437
00:30:35 --> 00:30:38
going to get?  Do you want to know
that you're going to get a

438
00:30:38 --> 00:30:41
neurological disease as you get
older?  Do you want to know that

439
00:30:41 --> 00:30:44
you're likely to have a heart attack
before you're 50?

440
00:30:44 --> 00:30:47
Do you want others to have this
information?  Would you like your

441
00:30:47 --> 00:30:50
perspective partner to know that
you're likely to get some horrible

442
00:30:50 --> 00:30:53
neurological disease?
Would you like your insurance

443
00:30:53 --> 00:30:56
company to know this?
Would you like your children to

444
00:30:56 --> 00:31:00
know it?  I don't know.
I don't know what the answer is.

445
00:31:00 --> 00:31:04
Myself, I prefer actually not to
know and to go through life

446
00:31:04 --> 00:31:08
day-to-day having as good a time as
I can and letting whatever,

447
00:31:08 --> 00:31:12
God or chance take care of the rest.
But there is certainly merit in

448
00:31:12 --> 00:31:17
trying to prevent some things.
And this is really going to be a

449
00:31:17 --> 00:31:21
reality very soon.
Already, actually,

450
00:31:21 --> 00:31:25
you can get for your dog a DNA
profile that's actually

451
00:31:25 --> 00:31:30
fairly detailed.
It is RFLP mapping that we talked

452
00:31:30 --> 00:31:34
about in class where you can make
sure that your dog is who you think

453
00:31:34 --> 00:31:38
it is and who its parents are and
who it thinks it is.

454
00:31:38 --> 00:31:42
So you can get your own in the
future.  I don't know what they're

455
00:31:42 --> 00:31:46
going to call the American Kennel
Club equivalent for humans,

456
00:31:46 --> 00:31:50
but you'll be able to get your
certificate of DNA analysis.

457
00:31:50 --> 00:31:55
OK.  Design.  We talked long ago
about rational drug design.

458
00:31:55 --> 00:31:58
And Gleevec is really one of the
shinning examples of being able to

459
00:31:58 --> 00:32:02
look at the structure of a protein
and saying, hey,

460
00:32:02 --> 00:32:06
this protein is a bad protein,
it's an abnormal protein, and it's

461
00:32:06 --> 00:32:10
causative of leukemia.
And wouldn't it be great to inhibit

462
00:32:10 --> 00:32:13
its function?  And so let's design
the screen molecule which looks as

463
00:32:13 --> 00:32:17
though it will inhibit ATP binding
and prevent this kinase from acting.

464
00:32:17 --> 00:32:21
And, in fact, Gleevec works really
well that way.

465
00:32:21 --> 00:32:25
And this is something that is being,
this approach is being very,

466
00:32:25 --> 00:32:29
very actively pursued, and will only
be more actively pursued.

467
00:32:29 --> 00:32:33
And if you're thinking of a Course 5.
major or if you're thinking of many

468
00:32:33 --> 00:32:37
of the engineering majors,
you may well get into rational drug

469
00:32:37 --> 00:32:42
design and figuring out how to get
it to work.  Here's another one,

470
00:32:42 --> 00:32:46
prediction for the future and
Jurassic Park.

471
00:32:46 --> 00:32:51
Xenotransplantation,
using pigs that have immune systems

472
00:32:51 --> 00:32:55
engineered to look like the human
immune system for organ transplants.

473
00:32:55 --> 00:33:00
There are companies trying to do
this.

474
00:33:00 --> 00:33:04
Bionics.  Here is something for all
of you interested in mechanical

475
00:33:04 --> 00:33:08
engineering and other,
bionics.  Robocop.  Here's a movie

476
00:33:08 --> 00:33:12
to see if you haven't.
Artificial hearts.  Artificial

477
00:33:12 --> 00:33:17
hearts are a disaster presently.
AbioCor has a heart now that is

478
00:33:17 --> 00:33:21
fully implantable and that will take
over ventricular function,

479
00:33:21 --> 00:33:25
but it is a lousy heart.  And if one
of you could go and make a new heart

480
00:33:25 --> 00:33:29
that actually would work properly
that would be a real service

481
00:33:29 --> 00:33:34
to humankind.
Blood substitutes.

482
00:33:34 --> 00:33:38
We still do not have a blood
substitute that really works.

483
00:33:38 --> 00:33:43
There is one patented.  It's called
Oxygent.  It's a perfluorocarbon

484
00:33:43 --> 00:33:47
that will carry oxygen around the
blood in the body for a while,

485
00:33:47 --> 00:33:52
but it's not very good.  And finally
aging.  Here's a movie you probably

486
00:33:52 --> 00:33:56
haven't heard of,
Zardoz.  Zardoz, a great movie about

487
00:33:56 --> 00:34:01
a community where nobody aged and
they were really, really unhappy.

488
00:34:01 --> 00:34:05
And then Sean Connery comes along
and introduces this community that

489
00:34:05 --> 00:34:09
doesn't age and doesn't have sex and
is just generally miserable to the

490
00:34:09 --> 00:34:13
joys of procreation.
And they go for it.  And then they

491
00:34:13 --> 00:34:18
age and they die happily ever after.
So that's OK.  And if you're

492
00:34:18 --> 00:34:22
looking for a summer book to read,
Professor Guarente at MIT has

493
00:34:22 --> 00:34:26
written a great book about aging,
which is what his research focuses

494
00:34:26 --> 00:34:31
on.  And you might want
to look at that.

495
00:34:31 --> 00:34:35
So the challenge I give to you is
where are you going to come in?

496
00:34:35 --> 00:34:40
I wish you all the best of luck.
And it's been a pleasure to teach

497
00:34:40 --> 00:34:43
you.  [APPLAUSE]
