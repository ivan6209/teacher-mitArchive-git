1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
We're going to talk today about
recombinant DNA.

2
00:00:19 --> 00:00:24
This is a new section of the class.
We'll spend three lectures talking

3
00:00:24 --> 00:00:29
about recombinant DNA,
just sort of a practical how-to

4
00:00:29 --> 00:00:34
guide with respect to manipulating
DNA now that you've learned a bit

5
00:00:34 --> 00:00:39
about it and how we use it in
research and in other aspects of

6
00:00:39 --> 00:00:43
medicine and agriculture and so on.
Now, recombinant DNA has been around

7
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
for a long time.
And, frankly, it's got a bit of a

8
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
bad rap.  When people in the general
public hear the term recombinant DNA

9
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
they sort of conjure up these ideas
of mad scientists going around,

10
00:00:53 --> 00:00:57
you know, cloning bizarre organisms
or creating dangerous

11
00:00:57 --> 00:01:01
forms of life.
Although that's possible,

12
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
it's not what we typically do with
this technology.

13
00:01:05 --> 00:01:09
In fact, it has some rather benign
and other quite important

14
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
applications.  So,
Claudette, I'm not going to get this

15
00:01:13 --> 00:01:24
board, am I?  OK.

16
00:01:24 --> 00:01:29
Basically what we're going to be
talking about is genetic engineering.

17
00:01:29 --> 00:01:35
That ought to make the budding
engineers in the crowd happy.

18
00:01:35 --> 00:01:40
We're going to manipulate the DNA
of organisms and actually transfer

19
00:01:40 --> 00:01:46
DNA from one organism to another for
various purposes.

20
00:01:46 --> 00:01:51
There are three general tenants
that you need to pay attention to

21
00:01:51 --> 00:01:57
here.  The basic goal is to isolate,
from a complex genome, a piece of

22
00:01:57 --> 00:02:03
DNA of interest.
And amplify that piece of DNA,

23
00:02:03 --> 00:02:11
which could be a specific gene that
you're interested in,

24
00:02:11 --> 00:02:18
or it might be some other sequence
within that DNA.

25
00:02:18 --> 00:02:25
It doesn't have to necessarily be a
coding gene that you're interested

26
00:02:25 --> 00:02:33
in.  The purposes of this are to,
for example, produce therapeutic

27
00:02:33 --> 00:02:38
proteins or compounds.
In the context of disease,

28
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
for example, where individuals have
a genetic disease in which they

29
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46
cannot make a particular enzyme,
you might be able to treat that

30
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
disease by producing the relevant
enzyme via this technology in

31
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
another organism and then supply it
to that individual.

32
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
The organism that you put it in
could be a bacterium that produces

33
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
it in large quantities.
And you purify the enzyme and then

34
00:03:01 --> 00:03:05
perhaps inject it into the
individual.  It doesn't have to be

35
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
bacteria.  You can actually use
recombinant DNA technology,

36
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
genetic engineering to produce a
human protein in,

37
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
for example, some farm animal.
And there are actually companies

38
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
that will introduce human genes into
sheep or cows such that you can

39
00:03:19 --> 00:03:23
purify the recombinant protein from
the milk of that organism.

40
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
And perhaps it might be more folded
more properly or modified more

41
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
properly than it would be if in
bacteria.  And it might be more

42
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
easily purified from the milk than
it would be from the bacterial cells.

43
00:03:35 --> 00:03:45
We can also engineer organisms.

44
00:03:45 --> 00:03:49
So this is to make different life
forms that have different purposes,

45
00:03:49 --> 00:03:53
different values to us.  And I've
given you the example in past

46
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57
lectures about genetically modified
foods.  And your book talks

47
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02
about this as well.
You can make crops that are

48
00:04:02 --> 00:04:06
resistant to pesticides.
You can make crops that are

49
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
resistant to herbicides.
You can make crops that stay

50
00:04:10 --> 00:04:15
fresher longer,
taste better, have better shape for

51
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
packing, all sorts of things by
manipulating the genome of those

52
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
organisms such that they now have
new and useful properties.

53
00:04:23 --> 00:04:28
We'll also teach you about how to
make transgenic animals.

54
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
I've given you one example of this
already where you might want to make

55
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
a therapeutic protein in the milk of
a transgenic cow,

56
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
but there are lots of purposes for
making transgenic animals.

57
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
One important one, especially for
me, is to make disease models.

58
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
So once we understand a human
genetic disease we can use that

59
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
information to create animal species,
most typically mice that carry those

60
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
very same mutations.
And then study the disease process

61
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
in the context of a laboratory mouse
in ways that are difficult or

62
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
impossible to do in humans.
And we'll teach you how to do that.

63
00:05:02 --> 00:05:07
It all flows from the same general
principles of manipulating DNA and

64
00:05:07 --> 00:05:13
transferring it from one organism to
another.  The value of doing this is

65
00:05:13 --> 00:05:23
several-fold.

66
00:05:23 --> 00:05:28
Understanding our or other
DNA sequences.

67
00:05:28 --> 00:05:34
So without this technology,

68
00:05:34 --> 00:05:38
we actually couldn't have done the
genome project.

69
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
We need to purify up a lot of our
DNA in order to sequence it to

70
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
determine its sequence.
And likewise of other organisms.

71
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
So this was instrumental in
bringing us to the point we are

72
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
today of understanding our genetic
information to the nucleotide level.

73
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
As I mentioned, this technology
allows us to understand

74
00:05:57 --> 00:06:07
disease-causing mutations.

75
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
Again, we've taught you about that
mutations can occur,

76
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
disabled enzymes or other proteins
cause disease,

77
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
but that doesn't tell you why.
And using this technology to sort

78
00:06:16 --> 00:06:20
of dissect what's happening to that
individual gene by manipulating it

79
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
in different ways,
putting it in different contexts we

80
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
can begin to understand what the
specific consequences of that

81
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
mutation are, which ultimately
allows us to deal with the disease

82
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
more effectively.
And another value of just

83
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
manipulating DNA,
which we'll come to in a future

84
00:06:38 --> 00:06:42
lecture, is what you hear about in
the press as DNA fingerprinting.

85
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
It's a very practical use of this
technology in which you want to

86
00:06:46 --> 00:06:51
distinguish two individuals based on
the specific changes in their DNA.

87
00:06:51 --> 00:06:55
And we can do that because we can
amplify up DNA sequences from very,

88
00:06:55 --> 00:06:59
very small quantities and figure out
the specific nucleotide sequences of

89
00:06:59 --> 00:07:04
those DNA fragments and be able to
tell then two people apart.

90
00:07:04 --> 00:07:08
And this is useful in paternity
cases, it's useful in criminal cases,

91
00:07:08 --> 00:07:13
it's useful for archeological
purposes and otherwise.

92
00:07:13 --> 00:07:17
So there are really a great number
of values to this set of

93
00:07:17 --> 00:07:22
technologies.  So where do they come
from?  Well, we've been able to do

94
00:07:22 --> 00:07:27
this sort of thing since the late
1960s, early 1970s.

95
00:07:27 --> 00:07:31
And this is referred to,
in our field, as the Recombinant DNA

96
00:07:31 --> 00:07:43
Revolution

97
00:07:43 --> 00:07:51
And there were three things that
happened in this time period that

98
00:07:51 --> 00:08:00
made this technology possible.
Firstly was the ability to separate

99
00:08:00 --> 00:08:09
genomic DNA, specifically
into fragments.

100
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
So genomic DNA,
as you know, is huge.

101
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
Our chromosomes are long,
long linear pieces of DNA.  Even

102
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
bacterial chromosomes are a few
million nucleotides in length.

103
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
That's much too much to deal with
for many of these applications.

104
00:08:21 --> 00:08:25
And so it was necessary to
basically chop the genomic DNA up

105
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
into manageable sized pieces and
then be able to deal with those

106
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
pieces individually.
The second thing that

107
00:08:31 --> 00:08:38
was necessary --

108
00:08:38 --> 00:08:43
-- was the ability to transfer the
isolated pieces --

109
00:08:43 --> 00:08:50
-- into another organism.

110
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
And the organism of choice then and
largely now is bacteria.

111
00:08:54 --> 00:08:58
So it was observations made in the
1960s that bacteria would actually

112
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
take up from their environment
pieces of DNA and sometimes

113
00:09:02 --> 00:09:06
incorporate them within
their cells.

114
00:09:06 --> 00:09:12
That observation led to the notion
that you could do that on purpose,

115
00:09:12 --> 00:09:19
not just at random, and that would
be then using the bacteria basically

116
00:09:19 --> 00:09:26
as a cargo ship for the introduced
DNA.  And, finally,

117
00:09:26 --> 00:09:33
the ability to amplify the fragments
of interest to large quantities.

118
00:09:33 --> 00:09:42
So if I take one piece of DNA from

119
00:09:42 --> 00:09:46
this guy, it's a single molecule,
that's not enough.  I cannot use

120
00:09:46 --> 00:09:50
that for much.
I cannot use it to sequence his DNA,

121
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
for example.  I cannot use it to
study specific properties of that

122
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58
gene.  Instead I need to amplify it
up to very large quantities.

123
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
And, therefore,
it was necessary to figure out ways

124
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
basically to turn the bacteria into
little DNA factories that would

125
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
churn out large quantities of DNA of
interest.  And,

126
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
again, we'll review how that was
possible.  And all of these things

127
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
came together more or less the same
time of this timeframe,

128
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
and then the field took off.
Now we could manipulate DNA very

129
00:10:22 --> 00:10:27
precisely and begin to understand
DNA at a very specific level.

130
00:10:27 --> 00:10:31
So I'm going to give you some
examples of what we do.

131
00:10:31 --> 00:10:36
I'm actually going to give you
perhaps the first and only practical

132
00:10:36 --> 00:10:41
demonstration of this.
We're going to do an experiment

133
00:10:41 --> 00:10:46
before you, a dangerous thing to do
in front of a live audience.

134
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
We're actually going to transfer a
gene from one organism to another.

135
00:10:50 --> 00:10:55
We're going to start it today and
we'll finish it in subsequent

136
00:10:55 --> 00:11:00
lectures.  The gene of interest is a
toxic gene.  It's a toxic gene

137
00:11:00 --> 00:11:05
that's present in an organism known
as S. pyogenes.

138
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
You might know of this organism,
might have heard of this organism

139
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
because it's the flesh eating
bacterium.  Anybody heard of the

140
00:11:12 --> 00:11:16
flesh eating bacterium?
This is true.  If you get infected

141
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
with S. pyogenes and you're slightly
immunocompromised,

142
00:11:19 --> 00:11:23
but even if you have a bad strain of
it even if you're very healthy,

143
00:11:23 --> 00:11:27
the bacterium will go about eating
your flesh.  It actually can be

144
00:11:27 --> 00:11:31
lethal it's so devastating.
The organism, S.

145
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
pyogenes is a bacterium that has a
genome, of course.

146
00:11:35 --> 00:11:40
That genome has about a thousand
genes.  And the sequence of this

147
00:11:40 --> 00:11:44
genome is known.
So by standard DNA sequencing

148
00:11:44 --> 00:11:49
technologies, we'll actually review
those for you in a couple of

149
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
lectures, specific DNA sequences of
this organism is known.

150
00:11:53 --> 00:11:58
OK?  So we know exactly which genes
there are there.

151
00:11:58 --> 00:12:02
And, just for the sake of discussion,
let's consider a couple of genes.

152
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
Gene A, gene B and gene T.  And
it's this gene that we're interested

153
00:12:06 --> 00:12:11
in.  It's the gene that encodes a
very critical toxin that the

154
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
bacterium makes that kills your
cells.  And so when you're badly

155
00:12:15 --> 00:12:20
infected by this bacterium,
it's dumping out this toxin and it's

156
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
killing the cells in the surrounding.
And that's why it's

157
00:12:24 --> 00:12:28
flesh eating.  OK?
Now, you also heard in the previous

158
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
couple of lectures ago that these
genomes have other important

159
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
properties.  And just to remind you
they have origins of replication,

160
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
ORIs.  All genomes, for the purposes
of replication,

161
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
all pieces of DNA that are going to
be replicated need at least one

162
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48
origin of replication.
So this genome has one.

163
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
And this will come up in another
context shortly,

164
00:12:52 --> 00:12:56
but what we're really interested in
is this gene T here,

165
00:12:56 --> 00:13:00
the toxin gene.  We want to clone it.
We want to move it from this

166
00:13:00 --> 00:13:04
organism to another organism.
And specifically the other organism

167
00:13:04 --> 00:13:09
of choice, and this is often the
case, is E. coli.

168
00:13:09 --> 00:13:13
E. coli is a common gut bacterium
present in all of you in very,

169
00:13:13 --> 00:13:18
very large quantities.  It has been
modified for laboratory purposes

170
00:13:18 --> 00:13:23
largely weakened so that it cannot
easily make its way back into you

171
00:13:23 --> 00:13:27
and cause possible harm.
It's used in laboratories in

172
00:13:27 --> 00:13:32
another context all the time.
I'm depicting here an E.

173
00:13:32 --> 00:13:36
coli cell.  This is always confusing
because I depicted here with a very

174
00:13:36 --> 00:13:41
similar circle the genome of S.
pyogenes.  This is a bacterial cell.

175
00:13:41 --> 00:13:45
This is the membrane of the
bacterium.  And,

176
00:13:45 --> 00:13:50
of course, E. coli has its own
genome which has roughly the same

177
00:13:50 --> 00:13:54
size and roughly the same numbers of
genes.  What we're going to do is

178
00:13:54 --> 00:13:59
transfer one more gene from this
organism into that organism.

179
00:13:59 --> 00:14:05
Really, the purpose of today's
lecture is how do you do that?

180
00:14:05 --> 00:14:11
But before we consider how you do
it, let's ask the question why you

181
00:14:11 --> 00:14:18
would want to do it.
Anybody have any ideas?

182
00:14:18 --> 00:14:24
Why would you want to transfer this
potentially deadly toxin producing

183
00:14:24 --> 00:14:29
gene to another organism?  Yeah?
It could be that in a different

184
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
context it's actually beneficial in
one organism.  You may be able to

185
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
make a better E.
coli for some purpose if you

186
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
transferred this gene.
My favorite idea, actually,

187
00:14:36 --> 00:14:43
is global terror.

188
00:14:43 --> 00:14:47
We can laugh about this but,
you know, there are terrorists

189
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
around who are thinking these very
thoughts.  Sad but true,

190
00:14:51 --> 00:14:55
people are making modified organisms
with dangerous genes to make them

191
00:14:55 --> 00:15:00
more “pathogenic” for deliberate
release into populations.

192
00:15:00 --> 00:15:04
So I'm not teaching you how to do
this for malicious purposes but just

193
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
to know that there are people who do
that sort of thing.

194
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
Related to this point over here,
we want to understand these genes

195
00:15:12 --> 00:15:17
for the purposes of biological
research.  We want to understand as

196
00:15:17 --> 00:15:21
much as we can about disease-related
properties of genes and so on.

197
00:15:21 --> 00:15:25
And sometimes you cannot do the
experiments you want to do in the

198
00:15:25 --> 00:15:30
organism in which the
disease occurs.

199
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
And it's easier to do it,
in a sense, in isolation in another

200
00:15:33 --> 00:15:37
organism.  And then another example
might be to produce a vaccine.

201
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
If I could produce this protein
that's so toxic in large quantities,

202
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
I might be able to make a version of
it which is not toxic,

203
00:15:45 --> 00:15:49
very similar but not toxic.
And then I could inject it into

204
00:15:49 --> 00:15:53
people, they would raise an antibody
response against it such that if

205
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
they were ever challenged with the
real dangerous guy they

206
00:15:57 --> 00:16:00
would be immune.
So that would be a very useful thing

207
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04
to do.  And, again,
if we were worried about the

208
00:16:04 --> 00:16:08
terrorists we might do exactly that.
So this is the goal of our

209
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
experiment.  And we're going to
start the experiment today.

210
00:16:11 --> 00:16:15
So what I've done is acquired from
one of my colleagues in the Biology

211
00:16:15 --> 00:16:18
Department two tubes in which we
have placed these bacteria.

212
00:16:18 --> 00:16:22
S. pyogenes is in this one.
E. coli is in this one.  There are

213
00:16:22 --> 00:16:26
bacterial cells in here that grow in
suspension.  They grow inside

214
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
the liquid medium.
If we want to isolate the DNA we

215
00:16:30 --> 00:16:34
first have to isolate the bacteria.
So we spin these tubes in a

216
00:16:34 --> 00:16:38
centrifuge.  The bacteria then
pellet to the bottom of the tube.

217
00:16:38 --> 00:16:43
So the bacteria are now collected
at the bottom of these tubes.

218
00:16:43 --> 00:16:47
We then decant off the liquid.
I meant to bring a beaker, but I

219
00:16:47 --> 00:16:51
don't think they'll mind if I use
this one.  So it's always a little

220
00:16:51 --> 00:16:56
bit dangerous to do this,
and we'll have to take care of this

221
00:16:56 --> 00:17:00
later because it is a bit dangerous.
It's always a little bit dangerous

222
00:17:00 --> 00:17:05
to do this because you don't want to
bump yourself like I just did.

223
00:17:05 --> 00:17:13
It actually is starting to hurt a
little bit.  So we'll get rid of the

224
00:17:13 --> 00:17:21
liquid here.  And then we'll add
various chemical solutions to

225
00:17:21 --> 00:17:29
isolate the DNA from this bacterium.
Wow.  It's really starting to go.

226
00:17:29 --> 00:17:37
I'm just kidding.
Gets them every time.

227
00:17:37 --> 00:17:45
There really was no bacterium in
there of any kind.

228
00:17:45 --> 00:17:52
I know.  OK.  But we're still going
to go through this example.

229
00:17:52 --> 00:18:00
So we want to transfer this gene
into this organism.

230
00:18:00 --> 00:18:04
What are we going to do?
Well, the first thing we need to

231
00:18:04 --> 00:18:08
worry about is the fact that this
gene, the T gene here,

232
00:18:08 --> 00:18:12
is contained on a very large piece
of DNA.  As I said,

233
00:18:12 --> 00:18:16
it's got a thousand other genes.
It's about 4 million base pairs

234
00:18:16 --> 00:18:20
long.  And I'm only interested in
this one, so I need a way to isolate

235
00:18:20 --> 00:18:24
the T gene away from the other genes
present in this genome.

236
00:18:24 --> 00:18:28
So for this purpose I need a tool.
And the tool that I need is a

237
00:18:28 --> 00:18:41
restriction enzyme

238
00:18:41 --> 00:18:44
Restriction enzymes are nicely
described in your book.

239
00:18:44 --> 00:18:48
They are enzymes present in
bacterial cells which are designed

240
00:18:48 --> 00:18:51
to cut, to cleave DNA sequences.
And they do so in a site-specific

241
00:18:51 --> 00:18:55
fashion.  They are sequence-specific
--

242
00:18:55 --> 00:19:03
-- DNA cutting enzymes.

243
00:19:03 --> 00:19:09
We call them endonucleases,
but you don't have to worry about

244
00:19:09 --> 00:19:15
that term.  They are DNA cutting
enzymes.  Some of them produce,

245
00:19:15 --> 00:19:20
as you'll see in a moment, what we
call sticky ends,

246
00:19:20 --> 00:19:26
based on exactly how they cut the
DNA.  And others produce what we

247
00:19:26 --> 00:19:32
call blunt ends because they cut the
DNA in a slightly different way.

248
00:19:32 --> 00:19:35
There are hundreds of restriction
enzymes that have been purified from

249
00:19:35 --> 00:19:39
various bacteria.
There are now companies that will

250
00:19:39 --> 00:19:42
sell you the purified restriction
endonuclease.  There are whole

251
00:19:42 --> 00:19:46
businesses that are geared around
selling this stuff to molecular

252
00:19:46 --> 00:19:49
biologists around the world.
So you can order it up like you

253
00:19:49 --> 00:19:53
would order up a chemical from a
chemical supply house.

254
00:19:53 --> 00:19:57
As I said, these are site-specific,
sequence-specific DNA cutting

255
00:19:57 --> 00:20:01
enzymes.
So they recognize particular

256
00:20:01 --> 00:20:05
sequences in the DNA.
One such enzyme, which was one of

257
00:20:05 --> 00:20:09
the first discovered,
an enzyme called EcoR1,

258
00:20:09 --> 00:20:13
which comes from E. coli,
that's why it's EcoR1, R1 is

259
00:20:13 --> 00:20:17
probably restriction enzyme number
one, recognizes a particular

260
00:20:17 --> 00:20:21
sequence reading from the 5 prime
end of the DNA molecule towards the

261
00:20:21 --> 00:20:25
3 prime end.  It recognizes the
sequence G-A-A-T-T-C.

262
00:20:25 --> 00:20:29
And then the other side of that,
of course, is a 3 prime end.

263
00:20:29 --> 00:20:33
This is the polarity of DNA that
you've been shown in many cases

264
00:20:33 --> 00:20:37
before.  Now what is the reverse
strand?  What does the opposite,

265
00:20:37 --> 00:20:41
the complimentary strand of this
sequence look like?

266
00:20:41 --> 00:20:45
Can anybody tell me?
You want to yell it out in unison.

267
00:20:45 --> 00:20:52
Here is a G and --

268
00:20:52 --> 00:20:57
That was very good.
Notice anything about this?

269
00:20:57 --> 00:21:02
Yes.  It reads the same ways
forwards as backwards.

270
00:21:02 --> 00:21:05
G-A-A-T-T-C.  G-A-A-T-T-C.
What do we call that?  It's a

271
00:21:05 --> 00:21:09
palindrome.  Your book uses the word
MOM, which is a fairly boring

272
00:21:09 --> 00:21:13
palindrome.  It is reads the same
way forwards as backwards.

273
00:21:13 --> 00:21:16
I always like "A man, a plan,
a canal, Panama."  That's a

274
00:21:16 --> 00:21:20
palindrome, too.
It reads the same way forwards as

275
00:21:20 --> 00:21:24
backwards.  Anyway,
many, not all, but many restriction

276
00:21:24 --> 00:21:28
enzymes recognize palindromic
sequences.  They read the same way

277
00:21:28 --> 00:21:32
forwards as backwards.
OK?  And because of that they cleave

278
00:21:32 --> 00:21:37
the DNA on both strands at the same
position.  EcoR1,

279
00:21:37 --> 00:21:43
this enzyme that recognizes this
sequence will cleave the DNA between

280
00:21:43 --> 00:21:48
this phosphodiester bond,
between the phosphodiester bond

281
00:21:48 --> 00:21:53
between the G and the A.
And likewise on this strand.

282
00:21:53 --> 00:21:58
And the consequence of that is to
produce a break in the DNA,

283
00:21:58 --> 00:22:04
so you now have 5 prime G, 3 prime
C-T-A-A.

284
00:22:04 --> 00:22:07
Breaks occur here and the strands
get separated.

285
00:22:07 --> 00:22:10
They get pulled apart.
The hydrogen bonds that are holding

286
00:22:10 --> 00:22:14
these base pairs together are not
strong enough to hold the two

287
00:22:14 --> 00:22:17
molecules together,
at least most of the time,

288
00:22:17 --> 00:22:21
so most of the time they pull apart.
So you end up with a fragment that

289
00:22:21 --> 00:22:24
has an end that looks like this and
another fragment that has an end

290
00:22:24 --> 00:22:28
that looks like this,
A-A-T-C, here's the 3 prime end,

291
00:22:28 --> 00:22:32
G, and here's the 5 prime end.
OK?  So you snip it at either side

292
00:22:32 --> 00:22:36
and pull it apart.
Oops.  I did something wrong.

293
00:22:36 --> 00:22:41
I missed a T, yup, on both of them.
Thank you.  I don't think I've ever

294
00:22:41 --> 00:22:45
drawn those right.
In all the years I've taught this

295
00:22:45 --> 00:22:50
course, I always make it.
Not the same mistake necessarily

296
00:22:50 --> 00:22:54
but a mistake.
OK, so they make a break.

297
00:22:54 --> 00:22:59
And that then cleaves the DNA into
two pieces.

298
00:22:59 --> 00:23:04
Now, importantly,
at low enough temperatures these

299
00:23:04 --> 00:23:09
ends can find each other.
And we call them sticky because

300
00:23:09 --> 00:23:14
they are complimentary to one
another.  They can actually reform

301
00:23:14 --> 00:23:20
those base pairs.
So you would get a molecule which

302
00:23:20 --> 00:23:25
has 5 prime G,
three prime C-T-T-A-A.

303
00:23:25 --> 00:23:30
And then base paired to this
T-T-A-A would be an A-A-T-T sequence,

304
00:23:30 --> 00:23:36
which was covalently bound
on this side to the C.

305
00:23:36 --> 00:23:41
No.  Yeah, covalently bound on this
side to the C and non-covalently

306
00:23:41 --> 00:23:47
bound to this G.
OK?  So there are non-covalent

307
00:23:47 --> 00:23:53
bonds here and here and there are
base pairs in the middle that are

308
00:23:53 --> 00:23:59
holding these strands together.
We call this annealing.

309
00:23:59 --> 00:24:03
And, again, at low enough
temperatures you can get sticky ends

310
00:24:03 --> 00:24:07
of restriction enzyme cleaved sites
to come together this way.

311
00:24:07 --> 00:24:11
Now, importantly another enzyme
which we could use,

312
00:24:11 --> 00:24:16
discovered more or less the same
time, is an enzyme called DNA ligase,

313
00:24:16 --> 00:24:20
which you would have heard about in
the replication lectures.

314
00:24:20 --> 00:24:24
And DNA ligase will tie to
non-covalently linked pieces of DNA

315
00:24:24 --> 00:24:29
together by a covalent bond.
So DNA ligase will reintroduce this

316
00:24:29 --> 00:24:35
phosphodiester bond and this
phosphodiester bond to produce now a

317
00:24:35 --> 00:24:40
completely covalently-bound sequence.
OK?  So we can cut the DNA at sites

318
00:24:40 --> 00:24:46
we want to.  If we change the
temperature we can get these DNA

319
00:24:46 --> 00:24:51
molecules to come together in a
non-covalent fashion.

320
00:24:51 --> 00:24:57
And then, if we add this enzyme DNA
ligase, they will become covalently

321
00:24:57 --> 00:25:02
bond once again.  OK?
Key enzymes in our tool kit.

322
00:25:02 --> 00:25:06
As I said, there are other enzymes
that will cut DNA in a blunt fashion.

323
00:25:06 --> 00:25:10
They will not produce these sticky
ends.  I won't show you a new

324
00:25:10 --> 00:25:14
example of that today,
and it's not terribly important that

325
00:25:14 --> 00:25:18
you know about them,
but you can imagine that an enzyme

326
00:25:18 --> 00:25:22
that cuts in the middle between the
central positions of the recognition

327
00:25:22 --> 00:25:27
sequence will make a blunt end.
They won't be sticky.

328
00:25:27 --> 00:25:32
And those aren't as useful to us
because the sticky ends actually

329
00:25:32 --> 00:25:38
help us get two pieces of DNA
together in order to promote the

330
00:25:38 --> 00:25:43
cloning step at the end.
OK.  So the S. pyogenes genome that

331
00:25:43 --> 00:25:49
we need to isolate our T gene from
has a very large sequence.

332
00:25:49 --> 00:25:54
It's 4.1 times ten to the sixth
base pairs long all the way around

333
00:25:54 --> 00:26:00
the circle.  And I
was wondering. --

334
00:26:00 --> 00:26:10
Well, let me just remind you that
EcoR1 recognizes a 6 base pair

335
00:26:10 --> 00:26:20
recognition site.
So how many EcoR1 sites are there

336
00:26:20 --> 00:26:30
in this genome?
What's the frequency of EcoR1 sites

337
00:26:30 --> 00:26:37
along a piece of DNA?
Well, it has to be this particular

338
00:26:37 --> 00:26:42
sequence, G-A-A-T-C-C,
reading in that direction.

339
00:26:42 --> 00:26:47
The frequency of any given
nucleotide at any given site is one

340
00:26:47 --> 00:26:51
in four because there are four
nucleotides.  The frequency of six

341
00:26:51 --> 00:26:56
of a given sequence in a row is one
over four to the sixth,

342
00:26:56 --> 00:27:01
which is one in 4,096.
So every 4,000 base pairs or so,

343
00:27:01 --> 00:27:05
at random, you will find an EcoR1
site.  OK?  They won't be equally

344
00:27:05 --> 00:27:09
distributed.  There will be some
parts of the genome where  there are

345
00:27:09 --> 00:27:13
many by chance,
other parts where there are a few,

346
00:27:13 --> 00:27:18
but on average there will be about
one every 4,000 base pairs.

347
00:27:18 --> 00:27:22
And since the genome is 4 million
base pairs long that means that

348
00:27:22 --> 00:27:26
there's going to be about a thousand
EcoR1 sites scattered around

349
00:27:26 --> 00:27:31
this genome.  OK?
And they might be close together in

350
00:27:31 --> 00:27:35
some places, further apart in other
places, and so on around the gene.

351
00:27:35 --> 00:27:40
Now, the T gene is in a particular
place within the genome.

352
00:27:40 --> 00:27:44
I'm going to draw it blue.
Here's the T gene.  And when

353
00:27:44 --> 00:27:48
deciding what restriction
endonuclease, what restriction

354
00:27:48 --> 00:27:53
enzyme to use to cleave the T gene
in an intact fashion,

355
00:27:53 --> 00:27:57
I'll consult the sequence,
which I know, I'll choose an enzyme

356
00:27:57 --> 00:28:02
which I know won't cleave this gene,
won't cut this gene.

357
00:28:02 --> 00:28:06
There are no EcoR1 sites within this
gene.  OK?  So there might be one on

358
00:28:06 --> 00:28:11
this side and there might be one on
this side, but I've chosen EcoR1

359
00:28:11 --> 00:28:16
because I know there are no
G-A-A-T-T-C sequences within the T

360
00:28:16 --> 00:28:21
gene.  OK?  So to give you a visual
depiction of what we're talking

361
00:28:21 --> 00:28:26
about, more visual aids,
I brought with me a very,

362
00:28:26 --> 00:28:31
very dangerous piece of rope,
a flesh eating piece of rope.

363
00:28:31 --> 00:28:34
They never fall for it twice,
do they?  In which I've depicted the

364
00:28:34 --> 00:28:38
S. pyogenes genome as a piece of
covalently bound rope here.

365
00:28:38 --> 00:28:42
And the EcoR1 sites are shown in
yellow.  OK?  That's really what

366
00:28:42 --> 00:28:46
they are.  They're just little tags
basically that the specific enzymes

367
00:28:46 --> 00:28:50
recognize.  They're not there for
the purposes of the enzyme

368
00:28:50 --> 00:28:54
recognizing them.
They're just there.

369
00:28:54 --> 00:28:58
And the enzyme can recognize them.
OK?  And here I've colored in blue

370
00:28:58 --> 00:29:01
the T gene.
And you'll see that there are no

371
00:29:01 --> 00:29:05
EcoR1 sites within the T gene.
So now if I take this purified

372
00:29:05 --> 00:29:09
piece of DNA that I recovered from S.
pyogenes and I put in solution with

373
00:29:09 --> 00:29:13
the restriction enzyme EcoR1 in the
right sort of buffer and so on,

374
00:29:13 --> 00:29:16
the restriction enzyme will do what
it's able to do.

375
00:29:16 --> 00:29:20
It will go along and find those
sites and cut them.

376
00:29:20 --> 00:29:24
OK?  Everywhere it sees one it will
cut one.  You know what I really

377
00:29:24 --> 00:29:28
should do?  I should figure out how
to put the rope back together.

378
00:29:28 --> 00:29:32
That would be a trick.
I don't know how to do that.

379
00:29:32 --> 00:29:37
I should work on that.  That would
be great.  I should do that.

380
00:29:37 --> 00:29:41
All right.  So we've cleaved our
DNA molecule into fragments.

381
00:29:41 --> 00:29:46
OK?  And the S. pyogenes genome
that we drew up on the board will

382
00:29:46 --> 00:29:51
likewise be separated into fragments.
It will be separated into about a

383
00:29:51 --> 00:29:56
thousand fragments because there are
about a thousand sites.

384
00:29:56 --> 00:30:01
OK?  I now want to separate those
fragments from one another.

385
00:30:01 --> 00:30:05
In order to clone the T gene,
I need to separate the T gene away

386
00:30:05 --> 00:30:09
from all the other genes and all the
other DNA sequences in this genome.

387
00:30:09 --> 00:30:13
So how do I do it?  Well, I take
advantage of the fact that the

388
00:30:13 --> 00:30:17
pieces of DNA that I've liberated
are different lengths.

389
00:30:17 --> 00:30:21
You can see that there are some
short ones, there are some long ones,

390
00:30:21 --> 00:30:25
and it's actually quite easy to
separate DNA based on its size.

391
00:30:25 --> 00:30:29
The way you do that is to introduce
the DNA solution that contains the

392
00:30:29 --> 00:30:34
fragments of all sizes into what we
call an agarose gel.

393
00:30:34 --> 00:30:39
It's like a slab of Jell-O.
At one end, as shown here, here's

394
00:30:39 --> 00:30:44
the slab of Jell-O in which little
wells have been cut out,

395
00:30:44 --> 00:30:48
little indentations have been placed,
we introduce the DNA solution,

396
00:30:48 --> 00:30:53
usually with a colored dye to let us
know what we're doing,

397
00:30:53 --> 00:30:58
and then we put buffer on top of the
gel and at the two wells at the end

398
00:30:58 --> 00:31:03
of the gel, and then we apply
an electric field.

399
00:31:03 --> 00:31:07
This is called gel electrophorisis.
We apply a positive charge on one

400
00:31:07 --> 00:31:11
end, a negative charge on the other
end.  Which way will the DNA go?

401
00:31:11 --> 00:31:15
Which way will the DNA go?  Is DNA
positively charges or negatively

402
00:31:15 --> 00:31:19
charged?  It's negatively charged
because all those phosphates which

403
00:31:19 --> 00:31:23
carry a negative charge.
So in neutral pH buffer it will

404
00:31:23 --> 00:31:27
move towards the positive pole.
And so the DNA will actually

405
00:31:27 --> 00:31:31
separate.
And that's what you're seeing here.

406
00:31:31 --> 00:31:35
These are gels of different
concentrations of the stuff that

407
00:31:35 --> 00:31:39
makes them stiff.
So at a low percentage you see this

408
00:31:39 --> 00:31:42
fragmentation of fragments.
The larger fragments don't go very

409
00:31:42 --> 00:31:46
far, the smaller fragments go
further into the gel,

410
00:31:46 --> 00:31:49
and at different concentrations of
this stuff you'll get different

411
00:31:49 --> 00:31:53
separations in different positions.
And so with this separation

412
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
technique I can isolate this
fragment, which is of a particular

413
00:31:57 --> 00:32:00
size, away from other fragments.
So if you imagine this is the gel

414
00:32:00 --> 00:32:03
here, I put a negative charge here,
a positive charge here, the

415
00:32:03 --> 00:32:07
different DNA fragments are going to
separate along the gel with the long

416
00:32:07 --> 00:32:10
ones at the top and the short ones
at the bottom,

417
00:32:10 --> 00:32:13
and the middle sized ones will
separate in the middle and the T

418
00:32:13 --> 00:32:17
gene will separate right there.
And, if I have a lot of DNA to

419
00:32:17 --> 00:32:20
start with, I'm going to have a lot
of molecules of the T gene in this

420
00:32:20 --> 00:32:23
position on the gel.
And if I shine a UV light,

421
00:32:23 --> 00:32:27
which was what was done here,
I can literally see that position.

422
00:32:27 --> 00:32:31
And since I know how big it is,
because I know the sequence of this

423
00:32:31 --> 00:32:35
organism, I can know that it's
exactly 1,512 base pairs long.

424
00:32:35 --> 00:32:39
And, therefore, it should run right
there in this particular position on

425
00:32:39 --> 00:32:43
the gel.  So I can purify it.
Now, usually when I purify it,

426
00:32:43 --> 00:32:47
I purify a bunch of other things
that are of similar size.

427
00:32:47 --> 00:32:51
So I don't usually get it all only
this molecule,

428
00:32:51 --> 00:32:55
but I do a pretty good job of
purifying it.  And now I need to

429
00:32:55 --> 00:32:59
amplify it.  I've got some of that
DNA, but I need to have

430
00:32:59 --> 00:33:03
more of the DNA.
I need to have much,

431
00:33:03 --> 00:33:07
much, many, many more copies in
order to be able to do the

432
00:33:07 --> 00:33:12
manipulations I want to do
downstream.  So the next thing I

433
00:33:12 --> 00:33:16
need to do is get this piece of DNA,
and the other ones that I'm less

434
00:33:16 --> 00:33:21
interested in,
into bacteria and get the bacteria

435
00:33:21 --> 00:33:25
to make more and more of it.
So what I do in principle is to

436
00:33:25 --> 00:33:30
introduce the DNA into
different bacteria.

437
00:33:30 --> 00:33:35
There you go.  And now I need those
bacteria to make more of that stuff

438
00:33:35 --> 00:33:41
in order to give me what I need.
But there are certain problems.

439
00:33:41 --> 00:33:46
There are certain problems
associated with what I've just told

440
00:33:46 --> 00:33:52
to you.  The problems are that I
cannot tell which of these folks got

441
00:33:52 --> 00:33:57
the right gene.
That's one problem.

442
00:33:57 --> 00:34:03
I need to figure out a way to know
who got the T gene and who didn't.

443
00:34:03 --> 00:34:07
I also need to know who got any
piece of DNA versus who got nothing.

444
00:34:07 --> 00:34:12
The rest of you didn't get any DNA.
You are of no interest to me.

445
00:34:12 --> 00:34:16
If you were bacteria, I wish you
would die.  It's actually true.

446
00:34:16 --> 00:34:21
You'll see in a second.  The rest
of these guys I'm somewhat

447
00:34:21 --> 00:34:26
interested in,
and I'm really interested in him

448
00:34:26 --> 00:34:30
because he's got the TG.
I've picked on you a lot,

449
00:34:30 --> 00:34:34
haven't I?
So those are two of the problems.

450
00:34:34 --> 00:34:38
And the third problem is that I
need these guys to divide,

451
00:34:38 --> 00:34:41
which they're not terribly willing
to do.  I need them to divide,

452
00:34:41 --> 00:34:44
but bacteria will divide.  But the
bacteria, if these guys were

453
00:34:44 --> 00:34:48
bacteria, wouldn't know what to do
with that little fragment of DNA

454
00:34:48 --> 00:34:51
that I gave them.
They wouldn't know how to replicate

455
00:34:51 --> 00:34:54
it, how to make more if it because
I've just given them a naked piece

456
00:34:54 --> 00:34:58
of DNA and that's not terribly
useful.  So we need

457
00:34:58 --> 00:35:04
to overcome that.
And I'm going to tell you how.

458
00:35:04 --> 00:35:13
The process that we just described,
the introduction of DNA into the

459
00:35:13 --> 00:35:22
bacterium is called transformation,
bacterial transformation.  Again,

460
00:35:22 --> 00:35:31
here's a bacterial cell
with its own genome.

461
00:35:31 --> 00:35:35
We treat the bacterium with
chemicals that sort of loosen up the

462
00:35:35 --> 00:35:39
membrane a little bit or we
electroshock the bacteria which

463
00:35:39 --> 00:35:43
blows holes in the membrane.
And then when there are holes in

464
00:35:43 --> 00:35:47
the membrane, these little fragments
of DNA which I'm representing here,

465
00:35:47 --> 00:35:51
maybe I'll just show it as a single
linear piece of DNA,

466
00:35:51 --> 00:35:55
can float in inside the cytoplasm of
the bacteria.  They literally just

467
00:35:55 --> 00:35:59
float in there.  OK?
Now, the bacterium,

468
00:35:59 --> 00:36:04
if they knew what to do with this
piece of DNA, are remarkably good

469
00:36:04 --> 00:36:09
biofactories because bacteria will
divide at optimal conditions three

470
00:36:09 --> 00:36:14
times every hour,
three divisions every hour,

471
00:36:14 --> 00:36:20
which means 72 divisions every day.

472
00:36:20 --> 00:36:25
And if they could duplicate this DNA
every time they divided,

473
00:36:25 --> 00:36:30
if they could and they were able to
divide 72 times in a day,

474
00:36:30 --> 00:36:35
if there were one copy of that piece
of DNA per cell at the beginning of

475
00:36:35 --> 00:36:41
the process, just one cell that had
that piece of DNA in it then at the

476
00:36:41 --> 00:36:46
end of the day there could be two to
the seventy-second molecules of DNA.

477
00:36:46 --> 00:36:51
OK?  72 divisions.  Two to the
seventy-second which is roughly

478
00:36:51 --> 00:36:57
equivalent to ten to the twentieth
copies.  Now, each of you has ten to

479
00:36:57 --> 00:37:02
the thirteenth cells in you.
So you've got ten to the thirteenth

480
00:37:02 --> 00:37:06
or so copies of any particular piece
of DNA.  This is ten to the seventh

481
00:37:06 --> 00:37:10
times more than that,
so that's 10 million persons' worth

482
00:37:10 --> 00:37:14
of a given piece of DNA.
It's really quite remarkable.

483
00:37:14 --> 00:37:18
Now, Claudette always makes me
point out of the fact that you never

484
00:37:18 --> 00:37:22
reach this theoretical limit because
you would need an MIT's worth of

485
00:37:22 --> 00:37:26
bacterial solution to do it.
So in practice, when we do this

486
00:37:26 --> 00:37:30
sort of experiment,
we get about ten to the tenth to ten

487
00:37:30 --> 00:37:34
to the thirteenth bacteria
at the end.

488
00:37:34 --> 00:37:37
And, if each bacteria were able to
copy this DNA faithfully,

489
00:37:37 --> 00:37:41
we would have about ten to the tenth
or ten to the thirteenth copies of

490
00:37:41 --> 00:37:45
the DNA.  Still quite impressive for
not a lot of work.

491
00:37:45 --> 00:37:48
The problem I've already alluded to
is that the bacteria don't know how

492
00:37:48 --> 00:37:52
to deal with this introduced piece
of DNA.  This piece of DNA,

493
00:37:52 --> 00:37:56
for it to be brought up to ten to
the tenth or ten to the thirteenth

494
00:37:56 --> 00:38:00
copies needs to be replicated.
The DNA needs to be replicated.

495
00:38:00 --> 00:38:16
What do we know about replication?

496
00:38:16 --> 00:38:20
What did you learn about
replication?  What is the key thing

497
00:38:20 --> 00:38:23
that a piece of DNA needs in order
for it to be replicated?

498
00:38:23 --> 00:38:26
An origin of replication,
right?  And these fragments most

499
00:38:26 --> 00:38:30
likely are not carry an origin of
replication, so they're not going to

500
00:38:30 --> 00:38:34
be replicated.
So for this purpose we need an

501
00:38:34 --> 00:38:38
origin of replication.
And you'll see how we accomplish

502
00:38:38 --> 00:38:42
that.  We also mentioned the fact
that most of the bacteria,

503
00:38:42 --> 00:38:46
when we do this transformation,
this is actually a relatively

504
00:38:46 --> 00:38:50
inefficient process.
So most bacteria get no DNA.

505
00:38:50 --> 00:38:54
And they are, of course, not
interesting to us.

506
00:38:54 --> 00:38:58
That's all of you guys in the back
there.  So we need to get

507
00:38:58 --> 00:39:03
rid of all of you.
And then we need to find which

508
00:39:03 --> 00:39:09
bacterium has the clone of interest.
Which bacterium has the piece of

509
00:39:09 --> 00:39:15
DNA of interest?
This guy compared to the rest of

510
00:39:15 --> 00:39:21
them.  So the solutions to all of
those problems come in the form of

511
00:39:21 --> 00:39:27
what we call vectors.
The piece of DNA that we introduce

512
00:39:27 --> 00:39:33
at the beginning is not an isolated
fragment of DNA, in fact.

513
00:39:33 --> 00:39:49
Instead, we introduce the piece of

514
00:39:49 --> 00:39:56
DNA in the context of another DNA
molecule called a vector.

515
00:39:56 --> 00:40:03
Vectors, for the most part,
are derived from naturally occurring

516
00:40:03 --> 00:40:10
small DNA molecules that are carried
in many bacteria outside of the main

517
00:40:10 --> 00:40:16
bacterial genome.
This is the main bacterial genome.

518
00:40:16 --> 00:40:22
Many bacteria carry within their
cytoplasm small copies of DNA,

519
00:40:22 --> 00:40:27
also circular, called plasmids.
And these are short.  They might be

520
00:40:27 --> 00:40:33
on average 5,000 base pairs long
compared to a couple of million base

521
00:40:33 --> 00:40:39
pairs long.  So they're small
circular pieces of DNA.

522
00:40:39 --> 00:40:43
They get transferred from bacterium
to bacterium in the wild for the

523
00:40:43 --> 00:40:47
purposes of genetic exchange between
bacteria, also for transmitting drug

524
00:40:47 --> 00:40:51
resistance or pathogenic properties
from one bacteria to another.

525
00:40:51 --> 00:40:55
So they do get exchanged from
bacteria to bacteria.

526
00:40:55 --> 00:40:59
They were discovered a long time
ago and it was recognized that they

527
00:40:59 --> 00:41:03
would be very useful as vehicle,
vectors for cloned DNA.

528
00:41:03 --> 00:41:07
They have three key features,
which I will illustrate in this

529
00:41:07 --> 00:41:12
diagram.  One is the origin of
replication.  So they do replicate

530
00:41:12 --> 00:41:16
inside bacterial cells.
They have their own origin of

531
00:41:16 --> 00:41:21
replication.  So you can see where
we're going here.

532
00:41:21 --> 00:41:26
We're going to put our piece of DNA,
along with this,

533
00:41:26 --> 00:41:31
in order to get the replication of
our DNA as well.

534
00:41:31 --> 00:41:35
They have restriction sites.
Of course, they're going to have

535
00:41:35 --> 00:41:40
restriction sites throughout their
DNA sequence.  But they're designed

536
00:41:40 --> 00:41:45
now on purpose to have particular
restriction sites in a particular

537
00:41:45 --> 00:41:50
region of the piece of DNA which we
use for cloning purposes.

538
00:41:50 --> 00:41:55
So there might be EcoR1 site here
and nowhere else in this plasmid,

539
00:41:55 --> 00:42:00
another enzyme represented once, and
so on and so forth.

540
00:42:00 --> 00:42:05
Because we're going to introduce our
DNA into here and we don't want to

541
00:42:05 --> 00:42:10
disrupt the sequence of the rest of
the plasmid.  And the final thing

542
00:42:10 --> 00:42:15
they have of value is a drug
resistance gene,

543
00:42:15 --> 00:42:20
sometimes multiple drug resistance
genes.  An example of a drug

544
00:42:20 --> 00:42:25
resistance gene is the amp
resistance gene,

545
00:42:25 --> 00:42:30
and this confers resistance to a
common antibiotic called ampicillin,

546
00:42:30 --> 00:42:35
very similar to penicillin.
If you treat most bacteria with

547
00:42:35 --> 00:42:39
penicillin they will die,
with ampicillin, sorry, they will

548
00:42:39 --> 00:42:43
die.  If you treat a bacterium
that's carrying a plasmid that has

549
00:42:43 --> 00:42:47
an ampicillin resistance gene the
bacterium will live,

550
00:42:47 --> 00:42:51
OK, because it inactivates the
ampicillin.  It makes it non-toxic

551
00:42:51 --> 00:42:55
to the bacteria.
And now you can see how we're going

552
00:42:55 --> 00:42:59
to distinguish bacteria that get DNA
from bacteria that don't

553
00:42:59 --> 00:43:04
get any DNA.
The bacteria that get DNA are going

554
00:43:04 --> 00:43:09
to get a drug resistance gene.
So they're going to live in the

555
00:43:09 --> 00:43:14
presence of ampicillin.
If you don't get any DNA and you

556
00:43:14 --> 00:43:20
get treated with ampicillin you're
going to die.  OK.  So, quickly.

557
00:43:20 --> 00:43:36
I've taken my S.

558
00:43:36 --> 00:43:40
pyogenes genome and I cut it up into
EcoR1 sites.  I've cut it with EcoR1,

559
00:43:40 --> 00:43:44
so I've cut it into EcoR1 fragments.
And now I'm representing them as

560
00:43:44 --> 00:43:48
double-stranded with their sticky
ends showing.  Here's the end of an

561
00:43:48 --> 00:43:52
EcoR1 site.  Here's the end of an
EcoR1 site.  I'm just going to show

562
00:43:52 --> 00:43:56
you two for the sake of simplicity.
Here's another fragment liberated

563
00:43:56 --> 00:44:00
by EcoR1 from the S.
pyogenes genome.

564
00:44:00 --> 00:44:06
Maybe these are two of similar size
and I purified them together when I

565
00:44:06 --> 00:44:12
used my agarose gel technique.
So these are two pieces of DNA.

566
00:44:12 --> 00:44:18
And this one contains our friend
the T gene.  We've liberated these,

567
00:44:18 --> 00:44:24
they have their sticky ends, and
then we mix them with a plasmid that

568
00:44:24 --> 00:44:31
likewise has been cleaved
with EcoR1.

569
00:44:31 --> 00:44:36
So we have lots and lots of cut
plasmid that has the complimentary

570
00:44:36 --> 00:44:41
sticky ends.  OK?
This plasmid is that thing.

571
00:44:41 --> 00:44:46
I'm showing it as double-stranded
now so I can emphasize the sticky

572
00:44:46 --> 00:44:51
ends.  When I lower the temperature,
at some frequency this DNA molecule

573
00:44:51 --> 00:44:56
with find its way here,
an anneal at this end over here,

574
00:44:56 --> 00:45:01
at this end over here, and this
piece of DNA will find its way to a

575
00:45:01 --> 00:45:07
different plasmid an anneal over
here and over here.

576
00:45:07 --> 00:45:12
If I wait a while for that annealing
process to take place and then I add

577
00:45:12 --> 00:45:18
DNA ligase, the enzyme that seals
the nicks that form when those

578
00:45:18 --> 00:45:24
things come together,
I will get fully closed

579
00:45:24 --> 00:45:30
double-stranded DNA molecules which
are the plasmid plus

580
00:45:30 --> 00:45:35
a new piece of DNA.
This one will give some chunk of the

581
00:45:35 --> 00:45:40
S. pyogenes genome I don't care
about.  This one will give a plasmid

582
00:45:40 --> 00:45:45
that has a piece of the S.
pyogenes genome that carries the T

583
00:45:45 --> 00:45:50
gene.  This one I do care about.
OK?  So, in the final minute.

584
00:45:50 --> 00:46:04
I now take these plasmids that I've

585
00:46:04 --> 00:46:10
generated by this technique,
these recombinant plasmids, and I

586
00:46:10 --> 00:46:16
introduce them into bacteria in
culture using this transformation

587
00:46:16 --> 00:46:22
technique.  And then I plate them
onto a Petri dish.

588
00:46:22 --> 00:46:28
And the Petri dish,
importantly, has agar for the

589
00:46:28 --> 00:46:35
bacterial colonies to grow and it
contains ampicillin.

590
00:46:35 --> 00:46:40
It contains the drug ampicillin.
Now, as I said, the transformation

591
00:46:40 --> 00:46:45
process is inefficient.
Most bacteria that I treat in the

592
00:46:45 --> 00:46:50
transformation process will get no
DNA.  They'll land on this plate.

593
00:46:50 --> 00:46:55
And what will happen to them?
They'll die.  The plasmids that did

594
00:46:55 --> 00:47:00
get DNA, sorry,
the bacterium that did pick up a

595
00:47:00 --> 00:47:05
plasmid will have picked up an
ampicillin resistance gene.

596
00:47:05 --> 00:47:09
They will grow.
And they grow on little colonies,

597
00:47:09 --> 00:47:13
into little colonies after about a
day which have about a million cells

598
00:47:13 --> 00:47:18
each.  And they're separated from
one another.  So this colony might

599
00:47:18 --> 00:47:22
have that plasmid in it.
Every cell in this colony has that

600
00:47:22 --> 00:47:26
plasmid in it.
And this colony might have that

601
00:47:26 --> 00:47:31
plasmid in it.  OK?
I'm interested in this one because I

602
00:47:31 --> 00:47:35
want to now purify large quantities
of that piece of DNA.

603
00:47:35 --> 00:47:40
I'm actually not interested in this
one.  And next lecture we'll talk

604
00:47:40 --> 00:47:44
about how you specifically purify
this, isolate and identify this

605
00:47:44 --> 00:47:47
colony compared to the rest.
