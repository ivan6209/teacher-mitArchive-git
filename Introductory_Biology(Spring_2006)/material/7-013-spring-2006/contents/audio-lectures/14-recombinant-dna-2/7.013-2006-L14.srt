1
00:02:57 --> 00:03:01
OK.  So last time I reviewed for you
some of the basic cloning techniques.

2
00:03:01 --> 00:03:05
I failed to show you this slide,
which I intended to do, which is a

3
00:03:05 --> 00:03:09
commercially available plasmid.
I told you about plasmids last time,

4
00:03:09 --> 00:03:14
small circular DNA molecules that
are used in the purpose of cloning.

5
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
They're derived from nature, but
then they've been heavily

6
00:03:18 --> 00:03:23
manipulated by scientists to be
useful for the purposes of cloning.

7
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
Recall that they have two,
three critical elements, an origin

8
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
of replication to allow them to be
replicated inside of bacteria,

9
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
a selectable marker, a
drug-resistance gene,

10
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
ampicillin resistance gene for
example, and finally,

11
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
can you now show the middle slide?
He's working on it.  And finally

12
00:03:43 --> 00:03:47
what we call a multiple cloning site,
a set of restriction sites,

13
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
restriction enzyme recognition sites
that allow us to pop

14
00:03:51 --> 00:03:56
in pieces of DNA.
I have dual paper readers.

15
00:03:56 --> 00:04:01
Dual paper readers?  That doesn't
happen very often.

16
00:04:01 --> 00:04:05
You usually have one but not often
two in a row.  Good.

17
00:04:05 --> 00:04:10
So these are useful practical tools.
Maybe before I forget,

18
00:04:10 --> 00:04:15
I'll mention, remind you of the quiz
on Monday, where you go based on

19
00:04:15 --> 00:04:20
your last name.
There was a discussion last time

20
00:04:20 --> 00:04:25
about the review session,
which is actually not on here but we

21
00:04:25 --> 00:04:30
didn't change the review session.
Oh, because it was last night.

22
00:04:30 --> 00:04:34
We weren't able to change the review
session, which was last night,

23
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
but there is a tutoring session
which will cover the same material

24
00:04:38 --> 00:04:42
from today between 4:00 and 6:00.
And then there are additional

25
00:04:42 --> 00:04:46
sessions with the TAs,
including up till Monday morning

26
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
before the exam.
So there should be ample

27
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
opportunity to get your questions
answered.  So plasmids are now sort

28
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
of a useful and are a
very available tool.

29
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
This figure comes from your book.
It's a version of what we covered

30
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
in our example last time,
the cloning of the T gene.

31
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
Here in red is the starting
material, the DNA from the source.

32
00:05:10 --> 00:05:15
In our case it was S. pyogenes,
that flesh eating bacterium,

33
00:05:15 --> 00:05:19
but it could be anything.  It could
be genomic DNA from you.

34
00:05:19 --> 00:05:23
You take that genomic DNA,
whatever the source material is,

35
00:05:23 --> 00:05:27
you digest it, cut it with a
restriction enzyme,

36
00:05:27 --> 00:05:32
with a particular restriction enzyme.
You then mix that DNA with plasmid

37
00:05:32 --> 00:05:37
DNA which has been cut with the same
restriction enzyme,

38
00:05:37 --> 00:05:42
the sticky ends of the linear
molecule anneal with the sticky ends

39
00:05:42 --> 00:05:47
of the plasmid.
You then add DNA ligase to seal

40
00:05:47 --> 00:05:52
those nicks to produce full
covalently closed circular molecules

41
00:05:52 --> 00:05:57
that are composed of both the
plasmid and now an insert

42
00:05:57 --> 00:06:02
from the DNA sample.
You then take those recombinant

43
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
plasmids, mix them with bacteria
under conditions which allow the DNA

44
00:06:06 --> 00:06:10
to get into those bacterial cells.
This is a process called

45
00:06:10 --> 00:06:14
transformation.
You then plate those bacteria onto

46
00:06:14 --> 00:06:19
auger plates that contain the
antibiotic, in this case ampicillin

47
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
in our example.
The bacteria that didn't get a

48
00:06:23 --> 00:06:27
plasmid die.  The bacteria that did
get a plasmid survive and form

49
00:06:27 --> 00:06:32
colonies on the dish.
And then the question I left you

50
00:06:32 --> 00:06:36
with was how are we going to find
the colony or colonies that carry

51
00:06:36 --> 00:06:41
the T gene?  How are we going to
find the gene,

52
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
the recombinant plasmid,
the colony carrying the recombinant

53
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
plasmid with the T gene?
I also want to mention a bit of

54
00:06:49 --> 00:06:54
terminology, which we will come back
to later.  We often refer to the

55
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
collection of colonies,
the collection of recombinant

56
00:06:58 --> 00:07:03
plasmids contained within those
bacteria as a library.

57
00:07:03 --> 00:07:07
Like a library containing books,
this is a collection of different

58
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
things.  In this case,
different recombinant plasmids which

59
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15
you can go back to repeatedly taking
isolates from the colony.

60
00:07:15 --> 00:07:19
In our case we would then grow up
the individual bacteria to get ample

61
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
amounts of the plasmid of interest.
And this term library is used in

62
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
molecular biology a lot,
a diverse collection of clone

63
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
fragments to which you can return
depending on your specific needs.

64
00:07:32 --> 00:07:38
So how are we going to isolate our
plasmid of interest?

65
00:07:38 --> 00:07:44
Well, if you recall,
we knew the sequence of the genome

66
00:07:44 --> 00:07:50
of S. pyogenes.
And, therefore,

67
00:07:50 --> 00:07:57
we knew the sequence of the T gene.
So imagine that the T gene had a

68
00:07:57 --> 00:08:03
particular sequence starting from
the 5 prime end of

69
00:08:03 --> 00:08:10
A-G-G-C-T-G-G-T-G-G-G-A
to the 3 prime end.

70
00:08:10 --> 00:08:14
So this is imbedded within the T
gene.  The reverse complement on the

71
00:08:14 --> 00:08:19
other strand reading in this
direction from the 5 prime end would

72
00:08:19 --> 00:08:23
be T, did I say that,
what's this?  C-C-C-A-C-C-A-G-C-C-T

73
00:08:23 --> 00:08:28
3 prime.  OK?  So we know a bit
about the thing we're

74
00:08:28 --> 00:08:34
interested in.
We know its sequence.

75
00:08:34 --> 00:08:40
And we can use this information to
our advantage to isolate the plasmid

76
00:08:40 --> 00:08:47
that carries this fragment.
So the bacteria, as shown on this

77
00:08:47 --> 00:08:53
slide, are present in colonies.
Each colony contains a recombinant

78
00:08:53 --> 00:09:00
plasmid.  The first step in
isolating the plasmid of interest is

79
00:09:00 --> 00:09:06
to make a copy of the plate that
carries these bacteria to replicate

80
00:09:06 --> 00:09:13
what's on this plate onto a piece of
filter paper.

81
00:09:13 --> 00:09:20
We call this replica plating.

82
00:09:20 --> 00:09:27
And in this case we're going to do

83
00:09:27 --> 00:09:33
it onto a filter,
a piece of paper or nylon to make a

84
00:09:33 --> 00:09:39
copy of the colonies and the pattern
of the colonies onto something else

85
00:09:39 --> 00:09:45
that we can manipulate.
So we make an exact copy.

86
00:09:45 --> 00:09:51
And this done by literally placing
the piece of filter paper onto the

87
00:09:51 --> 00:09:57
Petri dish, as shown here.
Here is the Petri dish with the

88
00:09:57 --> 00:10:01
colonies.
You place a filter on top of those

89
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
colonies.  They'll stick to it.
Some of the cells in those colonies

90
00:10:04 --> 00:10:08
will stick to the filter.
You then pull the filter off and

91
00:10:08 --> 00:10:11
you get some of the colonies,
some of the cells sticking in

92
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
exactly the place where they were on
the original plate.

93
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
You can actually place this on
another plate and allow those cells

94
00:10:17 --> 00:10:21
to grow directly on the piece of
filter paper.  So you make an exact

95
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
copy of what was here onto a piece
of paper.  Now,

96
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
what are you going to do with that?
Well, we're going to use this

97
00:10:28 --> 00:10:33
information that we have about the
sequence of the gene to isolate the

98
00:10:33 --> 00:10:38
colony of interest.
First thing we do is to lyse the

99
00:10:38 --> 00:10:44
bacteria that are now present on
this filter and denature the DNA.

100
00:10:44 --> 00:10:50
What I mean by denature the DNA is

101
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
to pull it apart.
It's double-stranded when it's

102
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
present in the bacteria.
To denature DNA is to make it

103
00:10:58 --> 00:11:02
single-stranded.
And typically the way we do that in

104
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
these applications is to place a
piece of filter paper under high pH

105
00:11:06 --> 00:11:11
conditions, and it causes the DNA
strands to melt apart.

106
00:11:11 --> 00:11:16
So now the plasmids, which were
double-stranded in these bacterial

107
00:11:16 --> 00:11:20
cells, were double-stranded here
have now been pulled apart into

108
00:11:20 --> 00:11:25
single-stranded molecules.
So, on this piece of filter paper

109
00:11:25 --> 00:11:30
there are cells with unwound DNA,
single-stranded DNA in them in this

110
00:11:30 --> 00:11:35
same pattern, which I won't try to
reproduce here.

111
00:11:35 --> 00:11:40
And the question is how are we
going to identify which colony

112
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
carries a piece of the T gene?
How are we going to do that?  Does

113
00:11:45 --> 00:11:50
anybody have a clue?
All you need to know is present up

114
00:11:50 --> 00:12:01
here.  Yeah?

115
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
So you're thinking of the example
from the book in which the,

116
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
in the example in the book they used
a plasmid that had two selectable

117
00:12:08 --> 00:12:12
markers.  And you were interested in
those that grew under one antibiotic

118
00:12:12 --> 00:12:16
selection and didn't grow under a
different antibiotic selection.

119
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
In our case, in our plasmid, we
actually didn't have two selectable

120
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
markers.  We only had one.
So we're not going to use that

121
00:12:24 --> 00:12:28
strategy.  We have to rely on some
of the information I've

122
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
given you already.
Well, we know the sequence of the T

123
00:12:32 --> 00:12:37
gene.  We know,
for example, this little bit of the

124
00:12:37 --> 00:12:42
T gene, so we can make some that we
call a probe.  A probe,

125
00:12:42 --> 00:12:47
for this application, is an
oligonucleotide,

126
00:12:47 --> 00:12:52
a small segment of nucleotides that
we can synthesize.

127
00:12:52 --> 00:12:57
You can actually make any DNA
sequence you want using

128
00:12:57 --> 00:13:02
chemical synthesis.
This has now been fully automated.

129
00:13:02 --> 00:13:06
So you can just punch the sequence
into a computer,

130
00:13:06 --> 00:13:11
attach it to one of these machines,
the machine will go off and make a

131
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
linear piece of DNA of any sequence
you want.  It's like a typewriter

132
00:13:15 --> 00:13:20
almost.  You type it in,
and what you get back out is a piece

133
00:13:20 --> 00:13:25
of DNA that is the sequence that you
typed in.  So we can make any DNA we

134
00:13:25 --> 00:13:29
want such that we could make a piece
of DNA that had the sequence

135
00:13:29 --> 00:13:36
A-G-G-C-T-G-G-T-G-G-G-A.

136
00:13:36 --> 00:13:41
OK?  We could make that piece of DNA.
Moreover, we could modify that

137
00:13:41 --> 00:13:47
piece of DNA with enzymes to add a
radioactive phosphate at this 5

138
00:13:47 --> 00:13:52
prime end.  So we could make a radio
labeled probe.

139
00:13:52 --> 00:13:58
So now that we have that,
what are we going to do?  Anybody?

140
00:13:58 --> 00:14:05
Yes.  Yes.

141
00:14:05 --> 00:14:10
Right.

142
00:14:10 --> 00:14:14
Exactly.  So this is now
complementary to the other strand.

143
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
The DNA within these cells that
have been lysed and now stuck onto

144
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
this filter are also single-stranded.
So this complementary strand is

145
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
going to be sitting in a single
stranded conformation ready to

146
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
anneal, hybridize with this probe.
So you apply this radioactive probe

147
00:14:30 --> 00:14:34
to this filter.
It will bind somewhat

148
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
indiscriminately at first,
but it will bind very tightly to

149
00:14:37 --> 00:14:41
that complementaryary strand from
the T gene.  And remember there are

150
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
probably a million bacterial cells
within this colony,

151
00:14:44 --> 00:14:48
so there will be a million copies of
the probe anneal to this colony.

152
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
You do have to do a little washing
to get rid of the nonspecific

153
00:14:51 --> 00:14:55
binding which will take place.
So you wash the cells, or wash the

154
00:14:55 --> 00:14:59
filter, get rid of the
nonspecific binding.

155
00:14:59 --> 00:15:03
The specific binding will withstand
the wash.  And then you apply a

156
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
piece of x-ray film.
And what you'll end up with is a

157
00:15:07 --> 00:15:11
faint image of the filter,
some very faint signal from the

158
00:15:11 --> 00:15:16
colonies that don't hybridize,
and a very strong signal from the

159
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
colonies that did hybridize properly
to the probe.  OK?

160
00:15:20 --> 00:15:24
So now you know, based on the
position on that filter,

161
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
which colony it is that carries the
T gene.  And in this case it's that

162
00:15:28 --> 00:15:33
one right there.
So we can go back to that master

163
00:15:33 --> 00:15:37
plate that we've kept,
use a toothpick, pluck off that

164
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
colony and grow it up into high
concentrations successfully having

165
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
completed our cloning project of the
ever toxic T gene.

166
00:15:45 --> 00:15:49
And that's gone through here in
this figure, if you want to look at

167
00:15:49 --> 00:15:53
it again.  You take this filter that
has the colonies.

168
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
It's actually the step here where
you grow the cells up on

169
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
the filter itself.
You then lyse the cells,

170
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
denature the DNA, add the
radioactive probe.

171
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
It won't hybridize strongly to
those colonies that don't carry the

172
00:16:08 --> 00:16:12
clone of interest.
It will hybridize strongly to the

173
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
colonies that do have the clone of
interest.  And then through this

174
00:16:15 --> 00:16:19
x-ray film method you can visualize
where those colonies are and then go

175
00:16:19 --> 00:16:23
back and pick the colonies from the
master plate.  OK?

176
00:16:23 --> 00:16:26
So that's how it works.
It's fairly straightforward and

177
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
works extremely well to give you the
cells and clones of

178
00:16:30 --> 00:16:41
interest.  Woops.

179
00:16:41 --> 00:16:46
So that's what we call clone
identification by hybridization

180
00:16:46 --> 00:16:51
using a radioactive probe.
And I should mention, because it

181
00:16:51 --> 00:16:57
will come up again later,
that we use these radioactive probes

182
00:16:57 --> 00:17:02
extensively for molecular biology.
And we use non-radioactive probes,

183
00:17:02 --> 00:17:07
oligonucleotide synthesized in the
same way that I mentioned for all

184
00:17:07 --> 00:17:12
sorts of molecular biology
applications in this era.

185
00:17:12 --> 00:17:17
And you'll see examples later in
the lecture.  I want to briefly

186
00:17:17 --> 00:17:22
mention another technique known as
cloning by complementation.

187
00:17:22 --> 00:17:27
In this instance, we're going to
clone by the function of the plasmid

188
00:17:27 --> 00:17:32
that we've introduced
into the cells.

189
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
Not its sequence.
By its function.  And the example

190
00:17:36 --> 00:17:40
I'm going to give you is to clone a
gene that you might know about based

191
00:17:40 --> 00:17:44
on the biochemistry of the organism,
but you haven't identified the gene

192
00:17:44 --> 00:17:49
that encodes that enzyme.
The example I'm going to give you

193
00:17:49 --> 00:17:53
is to clone an enzyme which is
responsible for catalyzing the

194
00:17:53 --> 00:17:57
breakdown of lactose,
a disaccharide.  And this is

195
00:17:57 --> 00:18:02
accomplished by an enzyme called
beta-galactosidase.

196
00:18:02 --> 00:18:06
And it converts glucose.
It converts lactose to glucose and

197
00:18:06 --> 00:18:11
galactose.  And this is an important
enzyme in bacteria and also in you.

198
00:18:11 --> 00:18:15
The enzyme is encoded by the lacZ
gene of bacteria.

199
00:18:15 --> 00:18:20
OK?  And this exercise that we're
going to go through is to try to

200
00:18:20 --> 00:18:25
isolate the lacZ gene through this
method called cloning by

201
00:18:25 --> 00:18:29
complementation.
We need to use a trick,

202
00:18:29 --> 00:18:34
which I'll show you on this slide.
And that is that there's an

203
00:18:34 --> 00:18:40
artificial substrate for this enzyme
which is called in the field X-gal.

204
00:18:40 --> 00:18:46
It's related to lactose.  The
important thing is that when X-gal

205
00:18:46 --> 00:18:52
gets cleaved by beta-galactosidase,
it releases galactose and this

206
00:18:52 --> 00:18:58
molecule which precipitates and
turns blue.  So we have a visual

207
00:18:58 --> 00:19:04
indicator of beta-galactosidase
activity by placing in the medium,

208
00:19:04 --> 00:19:10
either in liquid medium or on a
Petri dish, this substance X-gal.

209
00:19:10 --> 00:19:16
We know whether or not the cells
have beta-galactosidase activity by

210
00:19:16 --> 00:19:23
virtue of whether the cells or the
colonies turn blue.

211
00:19:23 --> 00:19:29
OK.  So the first thing that we're
going to do in this technique is to

212
00:19:29 --> 00:19:38
take some wild type E. coli.

213
00:19:38 --> 00:19:42
If we take a liquid culture of wild
type E. coli and we plate them onto

214
00:19:42 --> 00:19:47
a tissue culture,
a Petri dish that contains X-gal,

215
00:19:47 --> 00:19:52
this substrate that in the presence
of beta-galactosidase will turn blue,

216
00:19:52 --> 00:19:57
will get colonies.
And what color will those colonies

217
00:19:57 --> 00:20:02
be?  Blue.
These are normal E.

218
00:20:02 --> 00:20:07
coli.  So they're able to metabolize
the X-gal and produce this blue

219
00:20:07 --> 00:20:12
pigment.  OK?  Now,
I'm interested in the enzyme,

220
00:20:12 --> 00:20:17
the gene that encodes the enzyme
that carries out this activity.

221
00:20:17 --> 00:20:22
And the way that I'm going to get
to it is first to isolate mutant E.

222
00:20:22 --> 00:20:27
coli.  It cannot do this reaction.
I'm going to try to isolate a mutant

223
00:20:27 --> 00:20:32
strain that's deficient in
beta-galactosidase activity.

224
00:20:32 --> 00:20:37
And the way that I do that is to
mutagenize the wild type E.

225
00:20:37 --> 00:20:42
coli.  I can do this by physical
methods or more commonly by just

226
00:20:42 --> 00:20:48
adding a chemical mutagen to the
broth that the E.

227
00:20:48 --> 00:20:53
coli is growing in.
I mutagenize the cells and then I

228
00:20:53 --> 00:20:59
plate them onto a plate
that has X-gal.

229
00:20:59 --> 00:21:03
Now, most of the cells that got
mutagenized will have mutated some

230
00:21:03 --> 00:21:08
other gene, not the
beta-galactosidase gene,

231
00:21:08 --> 00:21:13
some other gene, or maybe no gene,
such that what color will those

232
00:21:13 --> 00:21:18
colonies be?  They'll be blue
because they still have a functional

233
00:21:18 --> 00:21:23
beta-galactosidase enzyme.
They still have a wild type lacZ

234
00:21:23 --> 00:21:28
gene.  So most of the colonies will
be blue.  But what if the cell

235
00:21:28 --> 00:21:33
incurred a mutation in the lacZ gene
that knocked out lacZ function?

236
00:21:33 --> 00:21:36
What color will the colony be?
Not blue.  It will be white.  OK?

237
00:21:36 --> 00:21:40
And we're going to assume, for the
sake of argument,

238
00:21:40 --> 00:21:44
that if you get a white colony it
means that the cells have a mutation

239
00:21:44 --> 00:21:48
in this gene lacZ.
That's actually not a safe

240
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
assumption.  It could have a
mutation in some other gene,

241
00:21:52 --> 00:21:56
but we're not going to worry about
that today.  Just say that if we get

242
00:21:56 --> 00:22:00
a white colony we're going to assume
that the cells have a mutation

243
00:22:00 --> 00:22:06
in the lacZ gene.
So now we want to clone the lacZ

244
00:22:06 --> 00:22:15
gene.  Our goal is to clone the lacZ
gene.  What are we going to do?

245
00:22:15 --> 00:22:25
What are we going to do?  Well,
I'll give you the first clue.  We're

246
00:22:25 --> 00:22:33
going to make a library.
We're going to make a library of

247
00:22:33 --> 00:22:39
fragments of DNA some of which will
carry the lacZ gene.

248
00:22:39 --> 00:22:45
From what are we going to make that
library?  What will be our source

249
00:22:45 --> 00:22:51
DNA to make that library?
Will it be these cells isolated

250
00:22:51 --> 00:22:57
from this colony or will it be some
other cell?  Do these cells have a

251
00:22:57 --> 00:23:02
functional lacZ gene?
No.  Do these cells?

252
00:23:02 --> 00:23:08
Yes.  So you want to make a library
from wild type E.

253
00:23:08 --> 00:23:13
coli.  So that you have a bunch of
plasmids that carry fragments of the

254
00:23:13 --> 00:23:19
E. coli genome some of which carry
the lacZ gene.

255
00:23:19 --> 00:23:25
What am I going to do with that
library?  What am I going to do with

256
00:23:25 --> 00:23:39
that collection of clones?

257
00:23:39 --> 00:23:45
I'm going to transform it en masse
all the different clones to a

258
00:23:45 --> 00:23:51
population of cells.
What cells will I transform it into?

259
00:23:51 --> 00:23:57
Which bacteria?
Would I put those ones into the

260
00:23:57 --> 00:24:05
lacZ mutants?

261
00:24:05 --> 00:24:10
And then I plate that transformation
onto plates that contain amp.

262
00:24:10 --> 00:24:16
I need the drug to identify those
cells that have picked up any

263
00:24:16 --> 00:24:21
plasmid because I don't care about
cells that haven't picked up any

264
00:24:21 --> 00:24:27
plasmid so I use amp plates.
And what else do the plates have in

265
00:24:27 --> 00:24:32
them?
The indicator of lacZ activity,

266
00:24:32 --> 00:24:37
X-gal.  So I'm going to take these
transformants,

267
00:24:37 --> 00:24:42
which were derived from these cells,
and I'm going to plate them out onto

268
00:24:42 --> 00:24:46
a plate.  What color will most of
the colonies be?

269
00:24:46 --> 00:24:51
Will most of them,
raise your hand.  Will most of them

270
00:24:51 --> 00:24:56
be white?  Will most of them be blue?
In fact, most of them will be white

271
00:24:56 --> 00:25:01
because most of the cells did not
pick up a plasmid that carries the

272
00:25:01 --> 00:25:06
functional lacZ gene.
Most of the cells picked up a

273
00:25:06 --> 00:25:10
plasmid that carried some other
piece of the E.

274
00:25:10 --> 00:25:15
coli genome.  OK?
So most of the cells will not be,

275
00:25:15 --> 00:25:20
will not have functional lacZ
activity, they'll be white.

276
00:25:20 --> 00:25:24
However, at some frequency a clone,
a cell will pick up a recombinant

277
00:25:24 --> 00:25:29
plasmid that does carry the lacZ
gene and that colony

278
00:25:29 --> 00:25:34
will turn blue.
And that's the colony that we're now

279
00:25:34 --> 00:25:38
interested in because it has
reconstituted lacZ activity.

280
00:25:38 --> 00:25:42
The mutant, the recombinant DNA has
complemented the mutation.

281
00:25:42 --> 00:25:51
So I could isolate this plasmid and

282
00:25:51 --> 00:25:54
sequence it.  And based on the
sequence I might have confidence

283
00:25:54 --> 00:25:57
that indeed it is the lacZ gene.
Remember I told you that there was

284
00:25:57 --> 00:26:00
an assumption built in here that
this mutation really did affect the

285
00:26:00 --> 00:26:04
lacZ gene?  And that's why the cells
were white.

286
00:26:04 --> 00:26:07
That was an assumption.
And to confirm that assumption we

287
00:26:07 --> 00:26:10
could look at the sequence of the
clone that we isolated and figure it

288
00:26:10 --> 00:26:14
out, figure out whether it's the
right enzyme.  OK?

289
00:26:14 --> 00:26:17
So I find that teaching this is
always a little confusing.

290
00:26:17 --> 00:26:20
I tried to simplify it today and go
through it slowly.

291
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
Hopefully you took notes and you
can think about it on your own.

292
00:26:24 --> 00:26:27
It is relatively straightforward
and it's a useful concept to

293
00:26:27 --> 00:26:30
understand that A) you could isolate
mutations, and B) you can find the

294
00:26:30 --> 00:26:34
genes that were mutated by
complementing those mutations

295
00:26:34 --> 00:26:44
through cloning.  OK?

296
00:26:44 --> 00:26:47
OK.  So now that I've spent a
lecture and a half talking about

297
00:26:47 --> 00:26:51
cloning, I'm now going to tell you
that cloning, while it was

298
00:26:51 --> 00:26:54
incredibly important and still is,
has almost been superceded by

299
00:26:54 --> 00:26:58
another technique.
It's not that we don't use cloning.

300
00:26:58 --> 00:27:02
We actually use it all the time.
But it's been joined by another

301
00:27:02 --> 00:27:08
technique known as PCR which stands
for the polymerase chain reaction.

302
00:27:08 --> 00:27:14
And any of you who have worked in

303
00:27:14 --> 00:27:18
molecular biology labs have been
exposed to this because it is a

304
00:27:18 --> 00:27:22
totally pervasive technology.
Everybody uses it.  And it's not

305
00:27:22 --> 00:27:26
just in molecular biology labs.
Forensic labs.  Archeology labs.

306
00:27:26 --> 00:27:30
Anybody who's interested in
generating large amounts of DNA from

307
00:27:30 --> 00:27:35
a small amount of DNA uses this
technique called PCR.

308
00:27:35 --> 00:27:38
It was invented only a few years ago,
but it's incredibly important.

309
00:27:38 --> 00:27:41
In fact, the guy who invented it,
who was not a very well known

310
00:27:41 --> 00:27:45
scientist, won the Nobel Prize just
a couple of years after he invented

311
00:27:45 --> 00:27:48
it because it became so powerful so
quickly.  It's a very,

312
00:27:48 --> 00:27:52
very simple technique.  It's one of
these ah-ha techniques that after

313
00:27:52 --> 00:27:55
it's been invented and described
everybody says,

314
00:27:55 --> 00:27:59
oh, I could have thought of that.
But, actually, nobody did until

315
00:27:59 --> 00:28:02
this guy, Kary Mullis.
So I'm going to show it to you

316
00:28:02 --> 00:28:05
briefly on the board.
And then we're going to go through

317
00:28:05 --> 00:28:08
a movie that shows it again.
So hopefully you'll get how it

318
00:28:08 --> 00:28:12
works.  Importantly,
it relies on having some information

319
00:28:12 --> 00:28:15
about the DNA that you want to
amplify up in large quantities.

320
00:28:15 --> 00:28:18
Again, the goal here is to amplify
up a piece of DNA of interest to

321
00:28:18 --> 00:28:21
large quantities.
This technique is so powerful that

322
00:28:21 --> 00:28:24
you can use a single DNA molecule to
start.  You can use the amount of

323
00:28:24 --> 00:28:27
DNA that you get from hair from a
crime scene, for example.

324
00:28:27 --> 00:28:31
And that's mostly the way,
you know.

325
00:28:31 --> 00:28:34
What is it?  CSI Miami and stuff.
They use this technique all the

326
00:28:34 --> 00:28:38
time.  So you can use minuscule
amounts of DNA.

327
00:28:38 --> 00:28:42
Even a single molecule is enough.
But you do need to know a little

328
00:28:42 --> 00:28:51
bit of known sequence.

329
00:28:51 --> 00:28:54
So if you know a little bit of known
sequence you can use PCR.

330
00:28:54 --> 00:28:58
So the first thing you do is to
denature the DNA.

331
00:28:58 --> 00:29:05
And in this case we do that by heat.

332
00:29:05 --> 00:29:10
If you heat up a DNA molecule it
will also separate from itself.

333
00:29:10 --> 00:29:16
And we typically heat it up to
about 94 degrees.

334
00:29:16 --> 00:29:21
And the consequence of this is this
double-stranded piece of DNA

335
00:29:21 --> 00:29:26
molecule will separate into two
single-stranded pieces of DNA.

336
00:29:26 --> 00:29:32
And at that point we anneal,
hybridize onto the DNA --

337
00:29:32 --> 00:29:37
I'm not about to do another
demonstration here.

338
00:29:37 --> 00:29:43
We anneal onto the DNA
oligonucleotides,

339
00:29:43 --> 00:29:48
synthetic little fragments of DNA
that are complementary to this known

340
00:29:48 --> 00:29:54
sequence at this end and at this end.
So I synthesize a short

341
00:29:54 --> 00:30:00
oligonucleotide which will anneal to
this strand at this position.  OK?

342
00:30:00 --> 00:30:03
I should have written up the
polarities because people often get

343
00:30:03 --> 00:30:07
confused.  Here's the 5 prime end of
this DNA molecule,

344
00:30:07 --> 00:30:11
the 3 prime end of that DNA molecule,
the 3 prime end of that one,

345
00:30:11 --> 00:30:15
5 prime end of that one.  So if I'm
thinking about the top strand here,

346
00:30:15 --> 00:30:18
the 5 prime end here, the 3 prime
end here, and that little

347
00:30:18 --> 00:30:22
oligonucleotide,
which in this context we call a

348
00:30:22 --> 00:30:26
primer, would have its 5 prime end
here and its 3 prime end here.

349
00:30:26 --> 00:30:30
Thus, the arrow because this is the
direction of DNA synthesis.

350
00:30:30 --> 00:30:34
If we're going to synthesize DNA off
of this piece of DNA it's going to

351
00:30:34 --> 00:30:38
go in that direction.
And then we likewise order up and

352
00:30:38 --> 00:30:42
anneal onto an oligonucleotide that
binds to this strand of this

353
00:30:42 --> 00:30:47
sequence.  And,
again, to show the polarities,

354
00:30:47 --> 00:30:51
here's the 5 prime end.  Ah, thank
you very much.

355
00:30:51 --> 00:30:55
Here's the 5 prime end,
here's the 3 prime end, so that the

356
00:30:55 --> 00:30:59
oligonucleotide primer has its 5
prime end here, its 3

357
00:30:59 --> 00:31:13
prime end here.  OK.

358
00:31:13 --> 00:31:18
And now these primers are sitting in
such a way, annealed to a template

359
00:31:18 --> 00:31:23
piece of DNA with a 3 prime end
facing in this direction,

360
00:31:23 --> 00:31:29
that are ready to be extended by DNA
polymerase.

361
00:31:29 --> 00:31:37
Sorry.  I'm getting confused about

362
00:31:37 --> 00:31:43
my colors here.
You can't see them on the board?

363
00:31:43 --> 00:31:49
You can't see the blue.  OK.  All
right.  So the blue,

364
00:31:49 --> 00:31:55
sorry about this.  The blue will now
be orange.  OK?

365
00:31:55 --> 00:32:01
And this one will be pink.
OK?  So I'm going to extend this

366
00:32:01 --> 00:32:07
pink oligonucleotide with a
polymerization reaction to

367
00:32:07 --> 00:32:13
fill in this strand.
And I'm going to extend the orange

368
00:32:13 --> 00:32:19
guy likewise to fill in this strand.
OK?  So this is accomplished by

369
00:32:19 --> 00:32:26
addition of DNA polymerase and the
nucleotide precursors that are

370
00:32:26 --> 00:32:33
needed for DNA synthesis,
which we abbreviate dNTPs.

371
00:32:33 --> 00:32:37
And if I incubate that in that way
I'll get extension from this primer

372
00:32:37 --> 00:32:42
in this direction,
extension from this primer in this

373
00:32:42 --> 00:32:46
direction.  And what I've done here
is to go from one DNA molecule to

374
00:32:46 --> 00:32:51
two DNA molecules.
I've duplicated this piece of DNA

375
00:32:51 --> 00:32:56
in a test-tube.
The beauty of PCR is that you then

376
00:32:56 --> 00:33:01
go through this process again and
again and again and again.

377
00:33:01 --> 00:33:05
And each time you get an exponential
increase in the amount of DNA.

378
00:33:05 --> 00:33:09
You go from one to two to four to
eight and so on and so on and so on

379
00:33:09 --> 00:33:13
and so on.  And in a relatively
short time you can now have millions,

380
00:33:13 --> 00:33:18
billions or more copies of your DNA.
OK?  So that's the basic principle.

381
00:33:18 --> 00:33:22
And, again, we'll go through it in
a little more detail in the movie.

382
00:33:22 --> 00:33:26
As I said, the technique was
invented by Kary Mullis,

383
00:33:26 --> 00:33:31
an investigator at a company called
Cetus.

384
00:33:31 --> 00:33:51
Kary Mullis is an interesting
character.  I don't have time to

385
00:33:51 --> 00:34:11
tell you the full stories of Kary
Mullis.  As I told you,

386
00:34:11 --> 00:34:31
he won the Nobel Prize.  He's a real
California kind of a surfer dude.

387
00:34:31 --> 00:35:05
Very laid back.

388
00:35:05 --> 00:35:09
So, anyway, you can use this
technique for lots of applications,

389
00:35:09 --> 00:35:14
as shown here.  It's been
commercialized in many ways.

390
00:35:14 --> 00:35:18
We now have machines that will go
through these various stages of

391
00:35:18 --> 00:35:23
denaturation, annealing and
synthesis using a temperature

392
00:35:23 --> 00:35:28
regulated block that will go from 94
degrees to 68 degrees to 72 degrees

393
00:35:28 --> 00:35:32
to allow denaturation,
annealing and polymerization around

394
00:35:32 --> 00:35:36
this circle many, many, many times.
And if you do this,

395
00:35:36 --> 00:35:39
for example, 30 times,
if you go through this cycle 30

396
00:35:39 --> 00:35:43
times you make two to the thirtieth
copies of your DNA,

397
00:35:43 --> 00:35:46
which is ten to the ninth DNA
molecules, which is a ton.

398
00:35:46 --> 00:35:49
And that can be done in just a
couple of hours using a machine such

399
00:35:49 --> 00:35:53
as this.  OK.  So let me take you
through this movie.

400
00:35:53 --> 00:35:56
I'm going to cut it short because
the process is gone through

401
00:35:56 --> 00:35:59
in great detail.
The narrator is actually Paul

402
00:35:59 --> 00:36:03
Matsudaira who is a professor here
at MIT.  And Paul really sort of

403
00:36:03 --> 00:37:38
drags it on, but I'm going to --

404
00:37:38 --> 00:37:41
Basically all he says is what I said,
which is you take an individual DNA

405
00:37:41 --> 00:37:45
molecule for which you know
sequences, and you run through this

406
00:37:45 --> 00:37:48
reaction multiple times.
And each time you do you get a

407
00:37:48 --> 00:37:52
duplication of the DNA sequence.
And your book goes through it, too.

408
00:37:52 --> 00:37:56
So I will get this thing posted on
the Web.  It's not on Monday's quiz

409
00:37:56 --> 00:38:00
so you don't have to
worry about that.

410
00:38:00 --> 00:38:04
We can learn about it in the future.
Maybe I'll fix it so that on

411
00:38:04 --> 00:38:09
Monday's lecture or Wednesday's
lecture, Professor Sive who is

412
00:38:09 --> 00:38:13
giving that lecture can go through
it with you.  So sorry about this.

413
00:38:13 --> 00:38:18
I also wanted to mention briefly
that the enzyme that we use to carry

414
00:38:18 --> 00:38:23
out the polymerization,
the particular DNA polymerase that

415
00:38:23 --> 00:38:27
we use is isolated from what we call
a thermophilic bacterium isolated

416
00:38:27 --> 00:38:31
from the hot springs.
And that's important because we

417
00:38:31 --> 00:38:34
carry out this reaction at a very
high temperature.

418
00:38:34 --> 00:38:37
You'll notice that the
polymerization was done at 72

419
00:38:37 --> 00:38:41
degrees.  Now,
your DNA polymerases won't work at

420
00:38:41 --> 00:38:44
72 degrees but this organism grows
at very, very high temperatures so

421
00:38:44 --> 00:38:47
its DNA polymerase can function
there.  And this,

422
00:38:47 --> 00:38:50
again, has turned into a cottage
industry.  There are hundreds of

423
00:38:50 --> 00:38:53
millions of dollars worth of this
particular polymerase called Taq

424
00:38:53 --> 00:38:57
polymerase sold for this
application.  OK.

425
00:38:57 --> 00:39:02
So let's carry onto the next topic
then.  So what we've been talking

426
00:39:02 --> 00:39:07
about now is transferring DNA in the
case of cloning or amplifying DNA

427
00:39:07 --> 00:39:12
for various applications.
For some applications that's not

428
00:39:12 --> 00:39:18
good enough.  For certain
therapeutic applications,

429
00:39:18 --> 00:39:23
for example, taking human genes and
cloning them to make therapeutic

430
00:39:23 --> 00:39:29
proteins or to do gene therapy you
cannot do standard cloning.

431
00:39:29 --> 00:39:33
And the reason is that human genes
are usually way too big.

432
00:39:33 --> 00:39:37
They have exons and introns,
which you learned about, and they

433
00:39:37 --> 00:39:41
can be hundreds of thousands and
sometimes millions of nucleotides in

434
00:39:41 --> 00:39:45
length.  And that's way too big to
fit into one of these plasmid

435
00:39:45 --> 00:39:49
cloning vectors and to efficiently
introduce it to bacteria.

436
00:39:49 --> 00:39:53
And so for the purposes of
generating clones from human genes

437
00:39:53 --> 00:39:58
we often use a technique
called cDNA cloning.

438
00:39:58 --> 00:40:06
And I'll take you through this

439
00:40:06 --> 00:40:13
briefly.  Recall that human DNA,
human genes are broken up into

440
00:40:13 --> 00:40:19
coding elements that we call exons.
And we usually number these exons

441
00:40:19 --> 00:40:26
from left to right,
one, two, three.  During the process

442
00:40:26 --> 00:40:33
of transcription a copy of this gene
is made in the form of a precursor

443
00:40:33 --> 00:40:40
mRNA which has the same sequence.
It has both the exons and the

444
00:40:40 --> 00:40:48
introns present.
And then before this is translated

445
00:40:48 --> 00:40:56
into protein the information in the
introns has to be removed in a

446
00:40:56 --> 00:41:02
process called splicing.
And that produces a mRNA which

447
00:41:02 --> 00:41:08
carries the exons lined up next to
each other.  So the introns are

448
00:41:08 --> 00:41:14
removed, the exons are joined,
and it's this mRNA that then gets

449
00:41:14 --> 00:41:20
translated into protein.
As I said, this can be very,

450
00:41:20 --> 00:41:26
very large.  But this is rather
short.  And so if we want to make a

451
00:41:26 --> 00:41:32
copy of a gene we can also make a
copy of its mRNA.

452
00:41:32 --> 00:41:38
And that might be more efficient and
more useful.  And this is a

453
00:41:38 --> 00:41:44
technique called cDNA cloning.
It was made possible by an

454
00:41:44 --> 00:41:50
invention at MIT,
a discovery at MIT of an enzyme that

455
00:41:50 --> 00:41:56
was not known to exist,
an enzyme which violated the

456
00:41:56 --> 00:42:02
so-called central dogma.
The central dogma being that DNA is

457
00:42:02 --> 00:42:06
transcribed into RNA and that's
translated into protein.

458
00:42:06 --> 00:42:11
David Baltimore discovered an
enzyme called reverse

459
00:42:11 --> 00:42:19
transcriptase.

460
00:42:19 --> 00:42:24
Which can take the information in
RNA and convert it to a DNA form.

461
00:42:24 --> 00:42:29
And he actually won the Nobel Prize
for that.  So this is the principle.

462
00:42:29 --> 00:42:34
You can take an mRNA which has
polarity 5 prime to 3 prime.

463
00:42:34 --> 00:42:39
This mRNA that I produced up there,
for example.

464
00:42:39 --> 00:42:44
You can anneal onto it an
oligonucleotide primer.

465
00:42:44 --> 00:42:49
This oligonucleotide primer is made
of DNA.  It has a 5 prime end and a

466
00:42:49 --> 00:42:54
3 prime end.  And then you add this
enzyme reverse transcriptase,

467
00:42:54 --> 00:43:00
which I'll abbreviate RT.
Reverse transcriptase is unique in

468
00:43:00 --> 00:43:06
its ability to copy from an RNA
template a DNA strand.

469
00:43:06 --> 00:43:12
And so you'll get a duplex which
has RNA on the top and

470
00:43:12 --> 00:43:20
DNA on the bottom.

471
00:43:20 --> 00:43:29
You then get rid of the RNA.

472
00:43:29 --> 00:43:40
You hydrolyze the RNA.

473
00:43:40 --> 00:43:45
So all you're left with is that
single strand of DNA.

474
00:43:45 --> 00:43:50
You now anneal on another primer,
another oligonucleotide primer which

475
00:43:50 --> 00:43:55
now has a polarity 3 prime to 5
prime in this direction because this

476
00:43:55 --> 00:44:00
one went 5 prime to 3 prime in this
direction.  And then you

477
00:44:00 --> 00:44:07
add DNA polymerase.

478
00:44:07 --> 00:44:12
Which will extend from this primer
and make a full duplex of DNA where

479
00:44:12 --> 00:44:17
both strands are made out of DNA.
And this we call a cDNA clone, a

480
00:44:17 --> 00:44:22
copy of the mRNA.
cDNA clone.  And you can make

481
00:44:22 --> 00:44:27
libraries of cDNA clones from all
the RNAs in your cells,

482
00:44:27 --> 00:44:32
for example.
And then you can look,

483
00:44:32 --> 00:44:36
using various techniques,
at different clones within that

484
00:44:36 --> 00:44:40
library for ones that function in
different ways.

485
00:44:40 --> 00:44:44
So I want to take you through a
couple of examples of how we use

486
00:44:44 --> 00:44:49
cDNAs in the context of gene therapy.
This one comes out of your book.

487
00:44:49 --> 00:44:53
This is an application where
there's an enzyme called TPA which

488
00:44:53 --> 00:44:57
will dissolve clots.
It's called tissue plasminogen

489
00:44:57 --> 00:45:02
activator.
And it's used now to treat people

490
00:45:02 --> 00:45:06
who've had heart attacks or strokes.
So what was done was to make a cDNA

491
00:45:06 --> 00:45:10
copy of the TPA gene,
introduce that into a plasmid vector

492
00:45:10 --> 00:45:14
with appropriate sequences in red
and yellow to allow the expression

493
00:45:14 --> 00:45:18
of that gene in bacteria,
transfer it into E. coli by

494
00:45:18 --> 00:45:22
transformation.
Now, the E. coli will pump out this

495
00:45:22 --> 00:45:27
enzyme TPA.
You can then purify that enzyme and

496
00:45:27 --> 00:45:32
inject it into this happy looking
stroke patient to help dissolve the

497
00:45:32 --> 00:45:37
clots that it formed in the
formation of the stroke.

498
00:45:37 --> 00:45:41
OK?  So that's an example of
genetic engineering one of our genes

499
00:45:41 --> 00:45:46
into bacteria to turn them into
little protein factories from which

500
00:45:46 --> 00:45:51
you can purify the enzyme and
hopefully mitigate the consequences

501
00:45:51 --> 00:45:59
of the disease.

502
00:45:59 --> 00:46:03
A second example,
as opposed to putting in a

503
00:46:03 --> 00:46:07
therapeutic protein,
you might want to put in a

504
00:46:07 --> 00:46:11
therapeutic gene.
So the example here I'll give you

505
00:46:11 --> 00:46:17
is cystic fibrosis.

506
00:46:17 --> 00:46:21
I've mentioned to you in earlier
lectures that cystic fibrosis is a

507
00:46:21 --> 00:46:26
genetic disease in which the
individuals have a defect in a

508
00:46:26 --> 00:46:31
transporter, an ion transporter,
so that in contrast to normal cells,

509
00:46:31 --> 00:46:35
here is a normal cell which has this
CFTR transporter which will allow

510
00:46:35 --> 00:46:40
chloride ions to move in and out of
the cell, as is a wild

511
00:46:40 --> 00:46:45
type individual.
In the case of CF,

512
00:46:45 --> 00:46:50
that transporter is missing.
That leads to an inability of the

513
00:46:50 --> 00:46:54
cells to properly regulate their
water content,

514
00:46:54 --> 00:46:59
and this leads to disease.
So what could you do about this

515
00:46:59 --> 00:47:04
disease?
Well, why don't you just put the

516
00:47:04 --> 00:47:09
defective gene back in?
We could make a cDNA copy of the

517
00:47:09 --> 00:47:14
cystic fibrosis gene,
build it into a vector and introduce

518
00:47:14 --> 00:47:19
it not into bacteria but back into
these cells.  So we could clone a

519
00:47:19 --> 00:47:24
CFTR cDNA back into these cells.
They would, in fact, pick up that

520
00:47:24 --> 00:47:30
DNA and begin to express it.
They would make this protein.

521
00:47:30 --> 00:47:34
And that would allow them to
transport chloride properly.

522
00:47:34 --> 00:47:39
And they might be “normal”.  This
actually works extremely well in the

523
00:47:39 --> 00:47:43
tissue culture dish.
It doesn't work nearly so well in

524
00:47:43 --> 00:47:48
the context of a human being.
Even though we can make viral

525
00:47:48 --> 00:47:53
versions of this,
viruses that carry cDNAs,

526
00:47:53 --> 00:47:58
recombinant viruses, and I'll draw
that up here.

527
00:47:58 --> 00:48:07
Using the same methods of

528
00:48:07 --> 00:48:12
recombinant DNA technology,
I can make a recombinant virus,

529
00:48:12 --> 00:48:17
like a cold virus that now carries a
piece of this cDNA for CFTR,

530
00:48:17 --> 00:48:23
and I could use that to infect a
person who has CF.

531
00:48:23 --> 00:48:31
That's a person and they have CF so

532
00:48:31 --> 00:48:37
they're not happy.
I could introduce into their nasal

533
00:48:37 --> 00:48:43
passage, they could breath in this
virus that carries the gene.

534
00:48:43 --> 00:48:48
And if the gene, if the virus
infected the cells of the lung,

535
00:48:48 --> 00:48:54
remember the problem occurs in the
lung, maybe, if this were very

536
00:48:54 --> 00:49:00
efficient, the person would be happy,
we could cure them.

537
00:49:00 --> 00:49:04
The problem is that this
introduction of the virus is very

538
00:49:04 --> 00:49:08
inefficient in vivo,
in the person.  It doesn't work very

539
00:49:08 --> 00:49:12
well.  You cannot get enough virus
in to infect enough cells to correct

540
00:49:12 --> 00:49:17
the disease in the person.
So although gene therapy is very

541
00:49:17 --> 00:49:21
attractive for many diseases such as
CF, it actually hasn't worked very

542
00:49:21 --> 00:49:25
well.  But there is one example of a
cure using gene therapy.

543
00:49:25 --> 00:49:30
And I want to just end by telling
you that story.

544
00:49:30 --> 00:49:33
To cure the disease you probably
heard about, the disease that causes

545
00:49:33 --> 00:49:36
“the boy in the bubble” syndrome,
which is severe combined

546
00:49:36 --> 00:49:39
immunodeficiency,
or at least one form of it,

547
00:49:39 --> 00:49:42
these individuals have a defect in
an enzyme called ADA,

548
00:49:42 --> 00:49:46
adenosine deaminase.  And this
results in a very severe

549
00:49:46 --> 00:49:49
immunodeficiency.
They don't have their immune cells.

550
00:49:49 --> 00:49:52
They cannot fight infection.  So
the kids have to stay inside

551
00:49:52 --> 00:49:55
protective chambers to avoid
exposure to pathogens,

552
00:49:55 --> 00:49:59
the bubble.  For a long time they
really weren't well treated.

553
00:49:59 --> 00:50:02
They could be treated with having a
little bit of the enzyme.

554
00:50:02 --> 00:50:05
I guess that's not shown here but
on the next slide.

555
00:50:05 --> 00:50:09
If you add the enzyme back,
even to their blood, you can get

556
00:50:09 --> 00:50:12
some protection.
But, nevertheless,

557
00:50:12 --> 00:50:16
the kids did not do terribly well
and often died from infections.

558
00:50:16 --> 00:50:19
Here's the disease mechanism.  It's
caused by a defective enzyme that

559
00:50:19 --> 00:50:23
normally breaks down adenosine.
This leads to a buildup of a

560
00:50:23 --> 00:50:26
precursor, or rather a metabolite
that kill cells of the immune system,

561
00:50:26 --> 00:50:30
and the individuals have immunocompromised
state.

562
00:50:30 --> 00:50:34
If you can just hang on for one or
two more minutes.

563
00:50:34 --> 00:50:38
So what's done here,
in contrast to the failed example

564
00:50:38 --> 00:50:42
for CF where I said that it's very
difficult to get the virus into the

565
00:50:42 --> 00:50:46
cells in the person,
what's done in the case of this

566
00:50:46 --> 00:50:51
disease is to take the cells out of
the person.  And this is called ex

567
00:50:51 --> 00:50:55
vivo gene therapy where you isolate
cells from the bone marrow of one of

568
00:50:55 --> 00:50:59
these kids, the stem cells that give
rise to the cells of the blood

569
00:50:59 --> 00:51:03
system, and then you infect those
cells in vitro with the virus that

570
00:51:03 --> 00:51:07
carries the cDNA of the ADA gene.
You isolate those cells that have

571
00:51:07 --> 00:51:11
that gene and then you introduce the
cells back into the person.

572
00:51:11 --> 00:51:15
And you can control that process
much more carefully,

573
00:51:15 --> 00:51:18
much more efficiently,
and you have a much greater

574
00:51:18 --> 00:51:22
concentration of cells that are
doing the right thing now.

575
00:51:22 --> 00:51:26
This goes through it in some more
detail.  It's a version of a slide

576
00:51:26 --> 00:51:30
from your book so you
can look at it.

577
00:51:30 --> 00:51:34
It's gene therapy.
And I want to point out that

578
00:51:34 --> 00:51:39
although it can work,
and it does work, it has one risk,

579
00:51:39 --> 00:51:43
namely that the virus that carries
the therapeutic gene actually

580
00:51:43 --> 00:51:48
integrates into the DNA of the cells.
And if it integrates into a gene

581
00:51:48 --> 00:51:52
that's important that integration
could actually cause a mutation.

582
00:51:52 --> 00:51:57
So there's a risk associated with
gene therapy.

583
00:51:57 --> 00:52:00
And, in fact, although this was
successful, as you can see here,

584
00:52:00 --> 00:52:04
two kids with SCID, or actually a
number of kids with SCID were cured

585
00:52:04 --> 00:52:08
through this ex vivo gene therapy
approach, and now they can run

586
00:52:08 --> 00:52:12
around like everyday kids,
unfortunately, in this first study

587
00:52:12 --> 00:52:16
of 11 patients,
all of whom were “cured”,

588
00:52:16 --> 00:52:20
later two of the kids ended up
getting leukemia.

589
00:52:20 --> 00:52:24
And they did because the virus had
inserted itself,

590
00:52:24 --> 00:52:28
the genome of the virus had inserted
itself next to a gene that when it

591
00:52:28 --> 00:52:32
becomes too active it causes the
cells of the immune system to

592
00:52:32 --> 00:52:36
proliferate abnormally
leading to leukemia.

593
00:52:36 --> 00:52:40
So although there was a benefit
there was also a risk.

594
00:52:40 --> 00:52:45
In this case, families of these
kids actually are willing to take

595
00:52:45 --> 00:52:49
that risk because it's such an awful
disease.  But you have to be aware

596
00:52:49 --> 00:52:54
that in all of these kinds of
therapies there's a risk-benefit

597
00:52:54 --> 00:52:57
analysis that has to go on.
