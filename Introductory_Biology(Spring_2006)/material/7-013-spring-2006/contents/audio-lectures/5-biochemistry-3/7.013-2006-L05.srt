1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:20
OK.  So we're going to continue with
the discussion about biochemistry,

2
00:00:20 --> 00:00:25
and specifically focus on enzymes
today.  Professor Sive introduced

3
00:00:25 --> 00:00:30
those to you briefly in
her last lecture.

4
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
I'm actually covering for her today.
This is one of her lectures but she

5
00:00:34 --> 00:00:39
has given me her material,
so hopefully it will go fine.

6
00:00:39 --> 00:00:44
She wanted me to remind you a
little bit about energetics,

7
00:00:44 --> 00:00:49
specifically that a negative Delta G
in a reaction implies that the

8
00:00:49 --> 00:00:54
reaction can occur spontaneously,
that is if the products have lower

9
00:00:54 --> 00:00:59
energy than the reactants.
And so given enough time this will

10
00:00:59 --> 00:01:03
happen in that direction.
But importantly for many reactions

11
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
an activation energy might be
necessary to get that reaction

12
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
started.  And if the activation
energy can be sufficiently high then

13
00:01:10 --> 00:01:14
in a reasonable amount of time the
reaction will actually never proceed

14
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
forward.  And it's the job of
enzymes actually to deal with that

15
00:01:17 --> 00:01:21
problem, as we'll discuss.
So this is the third of three

16
00:01:21 --> 00:01:24
lectures in biochemistry.
We're going to transition next week

17
00:01:24 --> 00:01:28
to genetics, and I'll be actually
teaching that section on genetics.

18
00:01:28 --> 00:01:33
Before we get into today's lecture
proper, Professor Sive wanted to

19
00:01:33 --> 00:01:38
quiz your knowledge from previous
lectures.  So firstly in this

20
00:01:38 --> 00:01:43
structure, this polypeptide
structure, the question is was the

21
00:01:43 --> 00:01:48
valine amino acid,
the Val, added last or first in this

22
00:01:48 --> 00:01:53
reaction?  Specifically true or
false, was it the last amino acid

23
00:01:53 --> 00:01:59
added?  False.  Very good.
It was the first.

24
00:01:59 --> 00:02:04
Because amino acids are added in
polypeptides from the amino end to

25
00:02:04 --> 00:02:09
the carboxy end.
And in this case Val is next to the

26
00:02:09 --> 00:02:14
amino ends.  So the second question
is in this reaction shown here,

27
00:02:14 --> 00:02:19
the generation of sucrose from
glucose and fructose,

28
00:02:19 --> 00:02:24
which has a positive Delta G,
does this release energy or consume

29
00:02:24 --> 00:02:30
energy?  Specifically true or false,
does this?  False.  Good.

30
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
So the Delta G is positive,
which means to get this reaction to

31
00:02:34 --> 00:02:39
go you need to add energy.
And there are various ways of

32
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
adding energy.
In a synthetic case a chemistry

33
00:02:43 --> 00:02:48
example you might add heat or you
might link this to another reaction

34
00:02:48 --> 00:02:53
that actually produced energy.
And finally is activation energy

35
00:02:53 --> 00:02:57
required only to initiate reactions
with a positive Delta G?

36
00:02:57 --> 00:03:02
No.  Very good.
So, as we just talked about,

37
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
activation energies can be important
both for reactions that consume

38
00:03:06 --> 00:03:11
energy and give off energy.
And so even in situations where

39
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
reactions give off energy,
it may be necessary for an enzyme to

40
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
deal with this activation energy
problem in order to speed up the

41
00:03:19 --> 00:03:24
rate of the reaction.
OK.  So Professor Sive gave you

42
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
examples previously comparing the
cell to a factory.

43
00:03:28 --> 00:03:33
And I think it's a very apt analogy.
And it's particularly apt with

44
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
respect to the subject of today's
lecture which are enzymes.

45
00:03:37 --> 00:03:41
There's a great deal of interest
these days in the MIT community and

46
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
around the research community around
the world in nano technology,

47
00:03:45 --> 00:03:50
building tiny little machines that
can do work.  Well,

48
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
I would say that proteins are the
consummate example of nano

49
00:03:54 --> 00:03:58
technology.  These are small
entities, five to ten nanometers in

50
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
diameter, which carry out very
specific and very powerful

51
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
reactions.
So proteins are already nano

52
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
particles to the nth degrees.
And the cell is itself remarkable

53
00:04:13 --> 00:04:18
in this respect because the cell,
which is only ten to thirty microns

54
00:04:18 --> 00:04:24
in diameter not only has all these
nano particles doing all this work,

55
00:04:24 --> 00:04:30
but it also contains the blueprint
information for building those.

56
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
It has the synthetic capability for
making the raw materials that they

57
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
act on.  And it has the micro
machining capability to build the

58
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
nano machines.
And this all takes place in a very,

59
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
very tiny space.  So the cell is an
unbelievable example of engineering

60
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
that we can only just aspire to
replicate.  OK.

61
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
So, again, the subject of today's
lecture is enzymes as biological

62
00:04:47 --> 00:04:52
catalysts.
And I want to introduce this by

63
00:04:52 --> 00:04:59
putting some of the earlier stuff
into perspective.

64
00:04:59 --> 00:05:06
So Professor Sive told you in her
last lectures about

65
00:05:06 --> 00:05:17
macromolecules --

66
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
I'm not going to talk about all of
them that she's told you about,

67
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
but she's talked about DNA,
deoxyribonucleic acid which is

68
00:05:23 --> 00:05:27
responsible for information
storage.

69
00:05:27 --> 00:05:37
She also told you about RNA,

70
00:05:37 --> 00:05:43
ribonucleic acid, a related polymer,
nucleic acid.  RNA actually has many

71
00:05:43 --> 00:05:49
functions in the cell.
Information transfer is an

72
00:05:49 --> 00:05:55
important one,
but it's not limited to that.

73
00:05:55 --> 00:06:01
RNAs can also function structurally.

74
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
When we talk about protein synthesis,
for example, you'll see that RNA

75
00:06:05 --> 00:06:09
molecules surface scaffolds for the
ribosome which is the machine that

76
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
makes proteins.
And they can also be catalysts.

77
00:06:13 --> 00:06:18
This was not appreciated for a long
time.  We now know that in biology,

78
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
in biological systems today RNAs can
function as catalysts.

79
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
And we actually believe,
in an evolutionary sense, that RNAs

80
00:06:26 --> 00:06:31
were the first catalysts.
Before there were polypeptides and

81
00:06:31 --> 00:06:36
proteins, life was made possible
through the catalytic properties of

82
00:06:36 --> 00:06:42
RNA molecules.
And your book actually talks about

83
00:06:42 --> 00:06:47
those in the chapter that you just
read.  They're called ribozymes,

84
00:06:47 --> 00:06:52
for RNA ribose-based enzymes.  And
then there were proteins.

85
00:06:52 --> 00:06:57
And we'll talk about proteins as
catalysts today,

86
00:06:57 --> 00:07:03
but importantly proteins also serve
structural roles.

87
00:07:03 --> 00:07:07
They compose, for example,
the long cables that extend

88
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
throughout your cells to give them
the proper shape and allow them to

89
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15
move.  They're important carrier
proteins.  For example,

90
00:07:15 --> 00:07:19
hemoglobin which carries oxygen to
different parts of your body.

91
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
There are proteins that bind to
iron, for example,

92
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
and deliver it from your diet to the
relevant parts of your body that are

93
00:07:27 --> 00:07:31
protein specific to that function.
And then there are catalysts.

94
00:07:31 --> 00:07:35
And it's the catalysts that we'll
focus on today.

95
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
Now, the way that proteins carry
out these diverse functions is that

96
00:07:39 --> 00:07:43
by virtue of their amino acid
sequence, their primary sequence of

97
00:07:43 --> 00:07:47
amino acids, they fold up into a
particular shape.

98
00:07:47 --> 00:07:51
Proteins have very specific
three-dimensional shapes.

99
00:07:51 --> 00:07:55
And these shapes then dictate their
function.  Depending on what the

100
00:07:55 --> 00:07:59
protein is supposed to do,
it will have a different shape.

101
00:07:59 --> 00:08:03
So, for example,
there are proteins that,

102
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
as I mentioned, function as
structural elements within the cell

103
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
like long cables.
They form polymers.

104
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
And these proteins have shapes a
little bit like Lego blocks that

105
00:08:15 --> 00:08:19
link together,
one to the next,

106
00:08:19 --> 00:08:23
and as such line up into these long
polymers.  So some proteins have

107
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
structures that just allow them to
bind to one another and

108
00:08:27 --> 00:08:32
form long polymers.
The proteins that we'll talk about

109
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
today, catalysts,
usually have, maybe always have a

110
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
specific shape.
And I'm taking a three-dimensional

111
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
structure here and simply cutting a
slice through it,

112
00:08:44 --> 00:08:48
so you're looking at sort of the
middle of the protein cut in half.

113
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
Here's the overall
three-dimensional structure of the

114
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
protein.  And in this portion here,
which we call the active site, is

115
00:08:56 --> 00:09:00
where the chemical reaction
takes place.

116
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
Now, we know a lot about many
enzymes, as well as other proteins

117
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
in the cell, based on the primary
amino acid sequence that we can

118
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
determine from the genes sequence.
But we also have seen what these

119
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
look like using methods in
x-ray crystallography.

120
00:09:15 --> 00:09:23
We won't actually review the methods

121
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
of x-ray crystallography with you,
but basically sufficed to say that

122
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
you can take a pure protein,
allow it to form into a crystal,

123
00:09:31 --> 00:09:35
shine x-rays through it, the x-rays
get diffracted based on the position

124
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
of the atoms in the protein.
And you can then interpret that

125
00:09:38 --> 00:09:42
diffraction pattern to tell you what
the structure of the protein was.

126
00:09:42 --> 00:09:46
So these are not just cartoons.  We
actually know what these proteins

127
00:09:46 --> 00:09:50
look like in great detail.
Not only do we know what the

128
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
proteins look like in many instances,
but we also often know what the

129
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58
protein looks like in complex with
some reactant to which its bound.

130
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
And these we call co-crystals.
Crystals that occur between the

131
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
protein and the substrate molecule
that it's going to act upon.

132
00:10:06 --> 00:10:11
And so we have a very clear idea of
what the chemistry is that's going

133
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
on inside the enzyme's active site.
And this information is not just

134
00:10:15 --> 00:10:20
useful for biological purposes,
but the more we understand enzymes

135
00:10:20 --> 00:10:24
and the specific structure of
enzymes the more we

136
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
can do about it.
So in disease,

137
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
for example, where you have an
enzyme that's causing some

138
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
pathogenic problem,
if you want to inhibit that enzyme,

139
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
the more you know about what's
happening here the more precise you

140
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
can be in your design of an
inhibitor.  And that's now happening,

141
00:10:40 --> 00:10:44
and I'll tell you an example of that
later in the lecture.

142
00:10:44 --> 00:10:48
Now, I'm just curious to know
whether you have a sense for why the

143
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52
protein has its particular structure,
and also what distinguishes one

144
00:10:52 --> 00:10:57
active site from another?
There are thousands of enzymes

145
00:10:57 --> 00:11:01
inside this cell.
Do they all look like this or does

146
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
each one look different?
Are they all the same?

147
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
No.  They're all different.
They're different in shape, as I

148
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
indicated earlier because their
primary amino acid sequence causes

149
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17
them to fold up based on local
interactions between amino acids

150
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
into helices and beta pleated sheets.
As I told you,

151
00:11:20 --> 00:11:24
they interact with each other.
And that gives them that large sort

152
00:11:24 --> 00:11:28
of three-dimensional structure.
But it's the nature of the amino

153
00:11:28 --> 00:11:32
acids in this active site
which ones are there.

154
00:11:32 --> 00:11:36
Is it a glutamic acid,
a valine, a methionine?

155
00:11:36 --> 00:11:40
Which specific ones are present
there and how are they oriented

156
00:11:40 --> 00:11:44
which allows them to bind to
particular molecules,

157
00:11:44 --> 00:11:48
substrates, and do chemistry on them?
And the reason that proteins are

158
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
much better catalysts,
or much more powerful catalysts than

159
00:11:52 --> 00:11:56
RNAs, is that our RNAs are fairly
boring.  They only have four

160
00:11:56 --> 00:12:00
subunits.  They don't have that
great diversity of chemical reactive

161
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
groups that you find in proteins.
Proteins, as you heard,

162
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
are composed of 20 distinct amino
acid subunits.

163
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
They are all differently chemically
in those R groups that Professor

164
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
Sive told you about before,
and they can do different chemistry

165
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
in the active site.
So different enzymes are different

166
00:12:18 --> 00:12:22
by virtue of their overall structure
and the particulars within the

167
00:12:22 --> 00:12:26
active site that allows them to do
what they do.

168
00:12:26 --> 00:12:32
I wanted to mention briefly that we
often use the suffix “ase” to

169
00:12:32 --> 00:12:38
designate an enzyme,
polymerase, DNA polymerase,

170
00:12:38 --> 00:12:44
sucrase.  You'll see those terms all
the time.  Whenever you see it,

171
00:12:44 --> 00:12:50
it reflects that the protein is an
enzyme, the suffix A-S-E.

172
00:12:50 --> 00:12:56
OK.  Again, just for perspective,
where do the proteins come from in a

173
00:12:56 --> 00:13:02
sense?
How does the cell know what to make?

174
00:13:02 --> 00:13:07
We're going to get into that in
later lectures,

175
00:13:07 --> 00:13:13
but just so you have a sense of it,
the information to produce a

176
00:13:13 --> 00:13:18
particular protein with a particular
amino acid sequence,

177
00:13:18 --> 00:13:23
and therefore shape and therefore
function, is encoded in the genes,

178
00:13:23 --> 00:13:28
which are in the DNA.  This
information is transferred into an

179
00:13:28 --> 00:13:34
intermediary molecule,
which is RNA.

180
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
Again, you're going to learn about
these details.

181
00:13:37 --> 00:13:41
You don't have to worry about them
so much right now.

182
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
You'll learn about these details
later in the class.

183
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
And the particular RNA molecule
that carries the information from

184
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
the DNA is called the mRNA,
messenger RNA.  And that mRNA is

185
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
then translated into the protein
itself.  So the reason that we have

186
00:13:55 --> 00:13:59
proteins of particular sequence and
particular shape and particular

187
00:13:59 --> 00:14:03
function is that we have different
genes that carry the information to

188
00:14:03 --> 00:14:08
make those specific proteins.
OK?  And we'll see that again in

189
00:14:08 --> 00:14:14
detail in later lectures.
OK.  So very importantly we talked

190
00:14:14 --> 00:14:20
last time, you talked last time
about the energetics of reactions,

191
00:14:20 --> 00:14:27
as illustrated here, that in many
reactions there is the energy of the

192
00:14:27 --> 00:14:33
reactants themselves,
the energy of the products,

193
00:14:33 --> 00:14:40
as well as so-called activation
energy.

194
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
That is the energy that's required
to make that reaction go,

195
00:14:44 --> 00:14:49
which can be greater than the energy
of the reactants.

196
00:14:49 --> 00:14:54
The important function of enzymes
is to lower the activation energy to

197
00:14:54 --> 00:14:59
reduce the threshold that these
reactants have to go over in order

198
00:14:59 --> 00:15:04
to carry out the reactions that lead
to the products.

199
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
The enzyme's function is to lower
the activation energy.

200
00:15:07 --> 00:15:11
And the way that enzymes do that is
several-fold, as we'll review.

201
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
The most important thing I can
imagine you can take away from this

202
00:15:14 --> 00:15:18
lecture is the understanding that
what enzymes do as catalysts is to

203
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
lower the activation energy.
They don't change the nature of the

204
00:15:21 --> 00:15:25
reactants, they don't change the
nature of the products,

205
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
they actually don't change
themselves in the course of the

206
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
reaction, but what they do is to
facilitate the reaction by lowering

207
00:15:31 --> 00:15:35
the activation energy.
And that is the nature of catalysis.

208
00:15:35 --> 00:15:46


209
00:15:46 --> 00:15:55
So enzymes are biological
catalysts.

210
00:15:55 --> 00:16:04
Their function is to increase the

211
00:16:04 --> 00:16:08
rate of a reaction.
As I said, reactions that release

212
00:16:08 --> 00:16:13
energy will happen spontaneously,
but it might take a very long time.

213
00:16:13 --> 00:16:18
Enzymes function to increase the
rate at which those reactions can

214
00:16:18 --> 00:16:22
happen.  And they can do so in
impressive ways.

215
00:16:22 --> 00:16:27
They can increase the rate by a
million-fold.  So they really can

216
00:16:27 --> 00:16:32
change whether a reaction will take
place in the lifetime of an

217
00:16:32 --> 00:16:37
individual compared to whether it
would take place in microseconds.

218
00:16:37 --> 00:16:41
OK?  And many biological processes
have to happen within the course of

219
00:16:41 --> 00:16:46
microseconds or seconds.
And, therefore, without enzymes

220
00:16:46 --> 00:16:51
those would not be possible.
Importantly, as illustrated on this

221
00:16:51 --> 00:16:56
slide, enzymes do not change the
Delta G.  They don't change the

222
00:16:56 --> 00:17:01
Delta G of the reaction.
Delta G is the same.

223
00:17:01 --> 00:17:07
What's being changed here,
in the presence of an enzyme,

224
00:17:07 --> 00:17:13
a catalyzed reaction, is the
activation state.

225
00:17:13 --> 00:17:19
The energetics of the products and
the energetics of the reactants

226
00:17:19 --> 00:17:24
don't change, so the Delta G does
not change.  So,

227
00:17:24 --> 00:17:30
again, they do so by lowering the
activation energy.

228
00:17:30 --> 00:17:36
And this is often done by combining
the reactants with portions of the

229
00:17:36 --> 00:17:42
protein to create what's called a
transition state complex.

230
00:17:42 --> 00:17:50
And it's the nature of that

231
00:17:50 --> 00:17:54
transition state complex,
the protein bound to the substrates

232
00:17:54 --> 00:17:58
that allows the activation energy to
be reduced, as you'll

233
00:17:58 --> 00:18:04
see in a moment.
I want to emphasize that the enzyme

234
00:18:04 --> 00:18:12
itself is the same at the end of the
reaction as at the beginning.

235
00:18:12 --> 00:18:20
The enzyme does not change.  It
goes through one reaction cycle.

236
00:18:20 --> 00:18:29
It's exactly as it was when it
started.

237
00:18:29 --> 00:18:33
And that's important because it
means that the enzyme can be reused.

238
00:18:33 --> 00:18:38
This is not a single reaction
process.  The enzyme can be used

239
00:18:38 --> 00:18:43
over and over and over again,
which is another part of the

240
00:18:43 --> 00:18:48
definition of a catalyst.
OK.  When we talk about enzymes,

241
00:18:48 --> 00:18:52
reactions, reactants and products,
we use slightly different

242
00:18:52 --> 00:18:57
nomenclature, and so it's important
that you see that and

243
00:18:57 --> 00:19:03
get to recognize it.
The enzyme, often denoted as E,

244
00:19:03 --> 00:19:10
combines with substrates, one or
more substrates,

245
00:19:10 --> 00:19:18
described as S, to form a complex
which is designated ES.

246
00:19:18 --> 00:19:25
That's where this transition state
is taking place.

247
00:19:25 --> 00:19:33
And then following that the enzyme
releases the products.

248
00:19:33 --> 00:19:41
And, importantly,
the enzyme can then be recycled to

249
00:19:41 --> 00:19:50
do this process again on new
substrates to produce new products.

250
00:19:50 --> 00:19:59
So the S in this is the reactant or
substrate, and P is the product,

251
00:19:59 --> 00:20:08
and the ES is the enzyme transition
state complex.

252
00:20:08 --> 00:20:21
As I said at the beginning,

253
00:20:21 --> 00:20:25
enzymes have very particular
specificities.

254
00:20:25 --> 00:20:29
They are designed to do specific
reactions.  They don't bind to every

255
00:20:29 --> 00:20:33
old molecule in the cell.
And this is determined,

256
00:20:33 --> 00:20:38
as I said, by the shape of the
enzyme and its complementarity to

257
00:20:38 --> 00:20:43
the substrates to which it binds.
And that's illustrated here on a

258
00:20:43 --> 00:20:48
slide from your book where you can
see an enzyme with its active site.

259
00:20:48 --> 00:20:54
And here are three potential
substrates.  Based on the shape of

260
00:20:54 --> 00:20:59
the active site and the particular
side chains on those amino acids,

261
00:20:59 --> 00:21:04
the yellow one and the red one will
fit into the active site,

262
00:21:04 --> 00:21:08
but the green one will not.
So specificity,

263
00:21:08 --> 00:21:12
in this case, is determined by the
complementarity between the shape of

264
00:21:12 --> 00:21:16
the substrates and the shape of the
active site.  And then,

265
00:21:16 --> 00:21:20
by virtue of their positioning
within the active site,

266
00:21:20 --> 00:21:24
the enzyme is now catalyzing the
binding, covalent attachment of the

267
00:21:24 --> 00:21:28
yellow one to the red one to produce
the product, as shown here.

268
00:21:28 --> 00:21:35
So specificity is achieved by the
complementarity between the active

269
00:21:35 --> 00:21:42
site and the substrates.
The transition state is achieved by

270
00:21:42 --> 00:21:49
a variety of conditions that the
enzyme places upon the substrates.

271
00:21:49 --> 00:22:02
So the substrate fits in much the

272
00:22:02 --> 00:22:08
way a key fits into a lock into the
active site.  This then promotes the

273
00:22:08 --> 00:22:15
formation of this transition state.
And that is done by three distinct,

274
00:22:15 --> 00:22:22
sometimes related but, distinct
mechanisms.  One is the fixing of

275
00:22:22 --> 00:22:29
the orientation of the two
substrates to one another.

276
00:22:29 --> 00:22:33
They're not just randomly floating
around in solution anymore.

277
00:22:33 --> 00:22:38
They're literally aligned next to
each other in a way that will

278
00:22:38 --> 00:22:43
promote the chemical reaction.
And that's one way that the

279
00:22:43 --> 00:22:48
activation state is lowered because
now you don't have the problem of

280
00:22:48 --> 00:22:53
kinetic energy of the molecules
floating around.

281
00:22:53 --> 00:22:58
A second is what's referred to as
induced fit, and in your book

282
00:22:58 --> 00:23:03
referred to as strain.
And I'll show you a slide of this in

283
00:23:03 --> 00:23:07
a second.  And this is important
because often times the activation

284
00:23:07 --> 00:23:12
energy is due to the fact that the
molecules have to get contorted.

285
00:23:12 --> 00:23:16
It's not a native confirmation of
the molecules during the chemical

286
00:23:16 --> 00:23:21
reaction. They actually have to get
bent in ways that they don't like to

287
00:23:21 --> 00:23:25
be bent.  The enzyme helps this by
adding chemical groups around it

288
00:23:25 --> 00:23:30
which promote the bending process,
promote the sort of straining of

289
00:23:30 --> 00:23:35
chemical bonds that allows
additional reactions to take place.

290
00:23:35 --> 00:23:38
So the enzyme produced is this
so-called induced fit.

291
00:23:38 --> 00:23:42
And, finally, the enzyme can,
depending on the nature of the

292
00:23:42 --> 00:23:46
chemistry, apply charge.
We know that there are charged

293
00:23:46 --> 00:23:50
amino acids, both positively and
negatively charged amino acids.

294
00:23:50 --> 00:23:54
There are acid-base reactions that
often take place within the enzyme's

295
00:23:54 --> 00:23:58
active site.  So the presence of
charges can facilitate those

296
00:23:58 --> 00:24:02
acid-base reactions.
They can donate positive charge or

297
00:24:02 --> 00:24:06
donate negative charge to allow the
reaction to take place more rapidly

298
00:24:06 --> 00:24:10
than it would do spontaneously.
And those are illustrated in a

299
00:24:10 --> 00:24:14
following slide,
actually.  This just shows you an

300
00:24:14 --> 00:24:18
example, a specific example of a
reaction that is catalyzed by a

301
00:24:18 --> 00:24:22
particular enzyme.
Here we have the substrate.

302
00:24:22 --> 00:24:26
It happens to be a sugar, a
disaccharide sugar,

303
00:24:26 --> 00:24:30
sucrose, and is made up of the
subunits glucose and fructose for

304
00:24:30 --> 00:24:34
you to use sucrose,
which you can eat.

305
00:24:34 --> 00:24:39
To produce energy you need to break
it down into glucose and fructose.

306
00:24:39 --> 00:24:44
And this reaction is catalyzed by a
particular enzyme called sucrase.

307
00:24:44 --> 00:24:49
And you can see in diagrammatic
form what happens here.

308
00:24:49 --> 00:24:54
Here's sucrase.  Here is its active
site.  You can see that its

309
00:24:54 --> 00:24:59
structure is exactly complimentary
to the substrate.

310
00:24:59 --> 00:25:03
So the substrate now floats in,
binds to this active site.  There's

311
00:25:03 --> 00:25:07
then a chemical reaction,
which is basically the addition of

312
00:25:07 --> 00:25:11
water to break this bond,
which is catalyzed by the enzyme.

313
00:25:11 --> 00:25:15
And then the products are released,
the enzyme remains as it was at the

314
00:25:15 --> 00:25:19
beginning of the reaction,
and it can go through the reaction

315
00:25:19 --> 00:25:23
cycle one more time.
This is the picture that shows you

316
00:25:23 --> 00:25:27
the various ways that the active
site can promote the transition

317
00:25:27 --> 00:25:32
state complex.
One, as I mentioned,

318
00:25:32 --> 00:25:36
is orientation.  Again,
two substrates here are positioned

319
00:25:36 --> 00:25:40
next to each other in the way that
we want them to react.

320
00:25:40 --> 00:25:44
So that's helpful.  A second is the
straining process,

321
00:25:44 --> 00:25:48
the fact that the protein can impose,
in a sense, stress on the molecules,

322
00:25:48 --> 00:25:52
the substrates, change their shape,
and in that way facilitate the

323
00:25:52 --> 00:25:56
chemical reaction,
and finally, as I mentioned,

324
00:25:56 --> 00:26:01
to charge.
In the case of acid-base reactions

325
00:26:01 --> 00:26:06
there are positively and also
negatively charged amino acid side

326
00:26:06 --> 00:26:11
chains that can contribute their
positive or negative charge to

327
00:26:11 --> 00:26:16
facilitate the reaction.
And this is one final example.

328
00:26:16 --> 00:26:21
Here we're talking about an enzyme
that adds a phosphate group onto

329
00:26:21 --> 00:26:26
glucose in an early step in glucose
metabolism.  And,

330
00:26:26 --> 00:26:31
in this case, the enzyme actually
changes its shape as a consequence

331
00:26:31 --> 00:26:37
of the substrate binding to it.
This happens [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

332
00:26:37 --> 00:26:43
At least he didn't point to me.
[LAUGHTER]  What was that all about?

333
00:26:43 --> 00:26:50
I was actually prepared to have
those sorts of interruptions on

334
00:26:50 --> 00:26:56
Monday which we always have.
I don't know what that was all

335
00:26:56 --> 00:27:02
about.
So what was it all about,

336
00:27:02 --> 00:27:08
pretty boy?  [LAUGHTER]  And who is
pretty boy anyway?

337
00:27:08 --> 00:27:14
Somebody back there.
OK.  Well, that was fun.

338
00:27:14 --> 00:27:20
Anyway.  Well, we were talking
about enzymes.

339
00:27:20 --> 00:27:26
So, again, some enzymes,
as indicated here in the example of

340
00:27:26 --> 00:27:32
hexokinase, will actually change
their shape in response to the

341
00:27:32 --> 00:27:38
binding of the substrate,
here glucose.

342
00:27:38 --> 00:27:41
And this is maybe a more interesting
example of something I'm going to

343
00:27:41 --> 00:27:44
come to later,
which is that proteins are not

344
00:27:44 --> 00:27:48
static in their shape.
They actually do change a little

345
00:27:48 --> 00:27:51
bit, and the ability of them to
change can tweak,

346
00:27:51 --> 00:27:54
can tune their activities so that
positioning the exact structure of

347
00:27:54 --> 00:27:58
the active site can change based on
other things that are happening

348
00:27:58 --> 00:28:02
in the protein.
And that's a useful thing with

349
00:28:02 --> 00:28:06
respect to regulation.
You can turn up the activity of an

350
00:28:06 --> 00:28:11
enzyme.  You can turn down the
activity of an enzyme based on the

351
00:28:11 --> 00:28:15
changes that the overall structure
can make.  OK.

352
00:28:15 --> 00:28:20
And then just to bring the subject
of specificity of enzyme function

353
00:28:20 --> 00:28:24
home, here is an example from real
life.  This is a packet of Equal,

354
00:28:24 --> 00:28:29
which you may use.  It's an
artificial sweetener.

355
00:28:29 --> 00:28:33
And you may have noticed on the very
back of the Equal packet it says

356
00:28:33 --> 00:28:38
phenylketonurics: contains
phenylalanine.

357
00:28:38 --> 00:28:42
And you might have wondered,
what the hell is that all about?

358
00:28:42 --> 00:28:47
Does anybody know?  Is anybody a
phenylketinuric?

359
00:28:47 --> 00:28:51
You don't actually have to say if
you are or not,

360
00:28:51 --> 00:28:56
but does anybody know what this
means?  Yes.  It's close.

361
00:28:56 --> 00:29:00
You're actually thinking of a
similar disease called

362
00:29:00 --> 00:29:05
alkaptonuria.
But you're on the right track.

363
00:29:05 --> 00:29:09
Right.  You cannot break it down.
And specifically what you cannot

364
00:29:09 --> 00:29:13
break down is phenylalanine.
This is a disease that affects only

365
00:29:13 --> 00:29:17
about one in 12,
00 individuals.  It's a so-called

366
00:29:17 --> 00:29:22
metabolic disease.
We'll talk about metabolic diseases

367
00:29:22 --> 00:29:26
later.  And the important point here
is that the enzyme that's

368
00:29:26 --> 00:29:30
responsible for breaking down
phenylalanine is altered in these

369
00:29:30 --> 00:29:35
individuals in one residue,
one amino acid out of 451.

370
00:29:35 --> 00:29:39
Protein has 451 amino acids.
One of those amino acids in the

371
00:29:39 --> 00:29:43
active site is not what it's
supposed to be.

372
00:29:43 --> 00:29:47
And therefore it cannot bind
properly to phenylalanine.

373
00:29:47 --> 00:29:51
And that causes a defect in the
breakdown of this and the build up

374
00:29:51 --> 00:29:56
of a toxic substance,
as I'll show you in a second.

375
00:29:56 --> 00:30:00
This is NutraSweet.  You might not
have known that it is a dipeptide

376
00:30:00 --> 00:30:04
composed of aspartic acid and a
phenylalanine linked together with

377
00:30:04 --> 00:30:08
an extra group on it,
probably to make it more soluble or

378
00:30:08 --> 00:30:13
ability to pass through
cells more easily.

379
00:30:13 --> 00:30:17
In your body, when you take in
phenylalanine from the diet like

380
00:30:17 --> 00:30:21
with respect to NutraSweet,
when NutraSweet gets into your body,

381
00:30:21 --> 00:30:25
the phenylalanine and the aspartic
acid get broken apart so you have

382
00:30:25 --> 00:30:29
increased phenylalanine,
but however you intake phenylalanine

383
00:30:29 --> 00:30:33
from your diet it's normally
converted enzymaticly by an enzyme

384
00:30:33 --> 00:30:37
called phenylalanine hydroxylase
which converts it from phenylalanine

385
00:30:37 --> 00:30:41
to tyrosine.
And the tyrosine is either used for

386
00:30:41 --> 00:30:45
stuff or it's broken down itself.
It's actually used for making

387
00:30:45 --> 00:30:49
melanin.  And so these same patients
who I have just mentioned,

388
00:30:49 --> 00:30:53
these phenylketonurics also have
lighter hair and lighter skin

389
00:30:53 --> 00:30:57
because they cannot make as much
tyrosine, and therefore don't make

390
00:30:57 --> 00:31:00
as much melanin.
But the real problem is not that.

391
00:31:00 --> 00:31:04
The real problem is that if you
have too much phenylalanine in your

392
00:31:04 --> 00:31:08
blood because you cannot break it
down properly.

393
00:31:08 --> 00:31:11
Then you build up phenylpyruvic
acid which is a natural byproduct of

394
00:31:11 --> 00:31:15
phenylalanine.
And this stuff is toxic when

395
00:31:15 --> 00:31:19
present in high levels.
And so the patients, these

396
00:31:19 --> 00:31:22
phenylalanine hydroxylase mutants,
which are now called

397
00:31:22 --> 00:31:26
phenylketonurics,
have a defect in this enzyme,

398
00:31:26 --> 00:31:30
cannot carry out this reaction
properly.  And therefore this

399
00:31:30 --> 00:31:34
spontaneous reaction happens
more readily.

400
00:31:34 --> 00:31:37
And therefore you have high levels
of this toxic compound that causes

401
00:31:37 --> 00:31:40
mental retardation,
actually.  It causes some sort of

402
00:31:40 --> 00:31:44
neuro toxicity.
And that's how it was originally

403
00:31:44 --> 00:31:47
defined.  And the reason we're
telling you about this is that this

404
00:31:47 --> 00:31:51
is an example of enzyme specificity
because this enzyme is different,

405
00:31:51 --> 00:31:54
as I said, in only one of 451 amino
acids.  The 408 amino acid is

406
00:31:54 --> 00:31:57
supposed to be an arginine,
and instead is a tryptophan.

407
00:31:57 --> 00:32:01
And as a tryptophan it cannot
properly bind to or carry out the

408
00:32:01 --> 00:32:05
chemical reaction.
And therefore the enzyme fails,

409
00:32:05 --> 00:32:10
levels build up, and the individuals
have a very, very severe phenotype.

410
00:32:10 --> 00:32:15
A very, very severe disease
presentation, I should say.

411
00:32:15 --> 00:32:20
Now, I indicated a little bit ago
that enzymes can be tweaked in their

412
00:32:20 --> 00:32:25
function.  Enzymes are not just
static in their ability to interact

413
00:32:25 --> 00:32:30
with substrates and catalyze
reactions.

414
00:32:30 --> 00:32:35
In fact, they are highly regulated.
And they're regulated by a number

415
00:32:35 --> 00:32:41
of different both external and
internal processes.

416
00:32:41 --> 00:32:47
So regulation of enzyme function is
critical with respect to producing

417
00:32:47 --> 00:32:53
the right sort of products at the
right sort of times and rates within

418
00:32:53 --> 00:32:59
your cells.  And one key factor that
determines the regulation of a given

419
00:32:59 --> 00:33:05
enzyme is the pH,
the pH of the solution that the

420
00:33:05 --> 00:33:11
enzyme finds itself.
Now, why would that be?

421
00:33:11 --> 00:33:18
Does anybody have a sense for why
that would be?

422
00:33:18 --> 00:33:26
Why does the pH of the cell's
environment determine the enzyme's

423
00:33:26 --> 00:33:31
function?  Yeah.  Say it again.
Right.  So proteins can denature at,

424
00:33:31 --> 00:33:35
extreme pHs in both directions,
actually.  But more importantly

425
00:33:35 --> 00:33:39
they're optimized based on the side
chains that are present within the

426
00:33:39 --> 00:33:43
active sites.  So,
as I said, there are charged amino

427
00:33:43 --> 00:33:46
acids which have different pKas.
And depending on the pH of the

428
00:33:46 --> 00:33:50
solution, they'll either be
protonated or not protonated.

429
00:33:50 --> 00:33:54
And their state of protonation,
whether or not that they have a

430
00:33:54 --> 00:33:58
proton bound to them,
will affect their ability to carry

431
00:33:58 --> 00:34:02
out the chemistry.
So enzymes are perfected to function

432
00:34:02 --> 00:34:07
in the pH conditions they find
themselves.  So,

433
00:34:07 --> 00:34:12
for example, salivary amylase,
which breaks down carbohydrates in

434
00:34:12 --> 00:34:16
your saliva, has a pH of around
seven because your saliva is around

435
00:34:16 --> 00:34:21
pH seven.  So it's been evolved to
function best at that pH.

436
00:34:21 --> 00:34:26
If you increase the pH or decrease
the pH it doesn't work so well,

437
00:34:26 --> 00:34:31
as indicated by this reduced
reaction rate at higher

438
00:34:31 --> 00:34:35
and lower pHs.
In contrast pepsin,

439
00:34:35 --> 00:34:39
which is an enzyme that is present
in your stomach acid and in your

440
00:34:39 --> 00:34:43
small intestine where the pH is very,
very low, works best at low pH.

441
00:34:43 --> 00:34:47
If you raise this to increase pH,
it doesn't work at all well because

442
00:34:47 --> 00:34:51
presumably at the increased pH
things that should be protonated are

443
00:34:51 --> 00:34:55
not protonated.
And now those reactions that should

444
00:34:55 --> 00:34:59
be taking place in the
active site don't.

445
00:34:59 --> 00:35:02
This is also another interesting
example of regulation in the sense

446
00:35:02 --> 00:35:06
that pepsin breaks down proteins.
And you actually don't want rampant

447
00:35:06 --> 00:35:10
protein breaking down enzymes
floating around in your body.

448
00:35:10 --> 00:35:14
Particularly, you don't want them
in the cells that make pepsin.

449
00:35:14 --> 00:35:18
You could imagine that the cells
that make pepsin run the risk that

450
00:35:18 --> 00:35:22
pepsin is going to eat all the
proteins in those cells.

451
00:35:22 --> 00:35:26
It doesn't happen because the pH of
those cells is around seven,

452
00:35:26 --> 00:35:30
and therefore the pepsin isn't
active.

453
00:35:30 --> 00:35:34
It only becomes active when it gets
dumped into the acid environment of

454
00:35:34 --> 00:35:39
the stomach and the small intestine.
So that's another justification for

455
00:35:39 --> 00:35:44
tweaking the activity of enzymes.
Another example is temperature.

456
00:35:44 --> 00:35:52
Again, based on the structure of the

457
00:35:52 --> 00:35:56
protein, which is strongly
influenced by the temperature,

458
00:35:56 --> 00:36:00
proteins have optima.  Most of our
proteins function best

459
00:36:00 --> 00:36:04
at what temperature?
37 degrees Centigrade.

460
00:36:04 --> 00:36:08
98.6, or whatever, Fahrenheit.
But that's not true of all

461
00:36:08 --> 00:36:12
organisms.  As I mentioned in the
first lecture,

462
00:36:12 --> 00:36:17
there are organisms that live in
thermal vents where the regular

463
00:36:17 --> 00:36:21
temperature is 80 degrees centigrade
or higher.  Their enzymes actually

464
00:36:21 --> 00:36:26
work like crap at 37 degrees,
but they work great at 72 or 75

465
00:36:26 --> 00:36:30
degrees.  They've been optimized,
based on their structure, to

466
00:36:30 --> 00:36:35
function best at the temperature in
which they find themselves.

467
00:36:35 --> 00:36:41
And finally, or almost finally,
covalent modification.

468
00:36:41 --> 00:36:48
And there are different ways that

469
00:36:48 --> 00:36:52
proteins can be modified after
they've been made in the translation

470
00:36:52 --> 00:36:56
process.  Other stuff can get added
to them covalently.

471
00:36:56 --> 00:37:00
And I'll give you an example of
phosphorylation --

472
00:37:00 --> 00:37:04
-- because it's going to come up in
later lectures,

473
00:37:04 --> 00:37:09
too.  Phosphorylation which means
that the protein gets an extra

474
00:37:09 --> 00:37:14
phosphate group added to it.
And if you imagine, for example,

475
00:37:14 --> 00:37:19
an enzyme, it has an active site
here --

476
00:37:19 --> 00:37:29
-- which is blocked at its front

477
00:37:29 --> 00:37:33
door.  Stuff cannot get into it
because this little arm is kind of

478
00:37:33 --> 00:37:38
hanging over the front of the active
site.  What can happen is that a

479
00:37:38 --> 00:37:43
reaction, another chemical reaction
that adds a phosphate group --

480
00:37:43 --> 00:38:00
Phosphorylation,

481
00:38:00 --> 00:38:06
which is another enzymatic reaction,
can cause the enzyme to open up and

482
00:38:06 --> 00:38:12
allow substrates to come through.
And this is a reversible process.

483
00:38:12 --> 00:38:18
Other enzymes called phosphatases
can come along,

484
00:38:18 --> 00:38:24
clip the phosphate off and return
the enzyme to its inactive state.

485
00:38:24 --> 00:38:32
And then, finally,

486
00:38:32 --> 00:38:36
there are partners,
other molecules that the enzyme

487
00:38:36 --> 00:38:41
binds that help the enzyme do its
thing.  And these are summarized on

488
00:38:41 --> 00:38:45
this slide, which comes from your
book.  There are three groups that

489
00:38:45 --> 00:38:49
are shown here.
You should probably be familiar

490
00:38:49 --> 00:38:54
with what these groups are and
examples from within them.

491
00:38:54 --> 00:38:58
For example, cofactors.  These are
usually small metal

492
00:38:58 --> 00:39:02
molecules, atoms.
Iron, copper and zinc are three that

493
00:39:02 --> 00:39:06
are shown here.
These participate in the chemistry.

494
00:39:06 --> 00:39:10
They actually participate in the
catalysis for enzymes that require

495
00:39:10 --> 00:39:13
them.  And, actually,
many enzymes in your bodies do

496
00:39:13 --> 00:39:17
require such cofactors.
And that's one of the reasons it's

497
00:39:17 --> 00:39:20
encouraged, you're encouraged to eat
zinc and stuff like that,

498
00:39:20 --> 00:39:24
because many of your enzymes need it.
Another class called coenzymes,

499
00:39:24 --> 00:39:28
this happens to be a horrible name
in my opinion, a really,

500
00:39:28 --> 00:39:32
really bad name.
It's one of these historical names

501
00:39:32 --> 00:39:36
that we're stuck with.
But these are, again, partner

502
00:39:36 --> 00:39:40
molecules.  They're really
substrates.  They're really

503
00:39:40 --> 00:39:44
substrates in the reaction,
but they're called coenzymes because

504
00:39:44 --> 00:39:49
they're used by many different
enzymes in coupled reactions.

505
00:39:49 --> 00:39:53
And an example here is NAD which is
involved in a hydrogen donating and

506
00:39:53 --> 00:39:57
receiving.  And this I mention
specifically because it's the

507
00:39:57 --> 00:40:01
product, or it's the byproduct of
one of the vitamins you

508
00:40:01 --> 00:40:05
eat, vitamin B.
And many of these coenzymes are the

509
00:40:05 --> 00:40:09
products of vitamins.
And so that's one of the reasons

510
00:40:09 --> 00:40:12
it's important to eat your vitamins.
And finally what are called

511
00:40:12 --> 00:40:16
prosthetic groups,
the same word as artificial arms and

512
00:40:16 --> 00:40:19
legs.  Prosthetic groups like heme,
which is present in hemoglobin,

513
00:40:19 --> 00:40:23
flavins, other things,
which are involved, again,

514
00:40:23 --> 00:40:26
in helping the enzyme or the protein
do its thing.  And the distinction

515
00:40:26 --> 00:40:30
between these and these is
that they are larger.

516
00:40:30 --> 00:40:34
They're actually synthesized by the
body, as opposed to these which are

517
00:40:34 --> 00:40:39
just taken up in the diet.
OK.  This is an example, and I'll

518
00:40:39 --> 00:40:44
go through it quickly for lack of
time.  This is an example of one

519
00:40:44 --> 00:40:48
chemical reaction.
What we're talking about here is an

520
00:40:48 --> 00:40:53
enzyme called dihydrofolate
reductase.  This is an important

521
00:40:53 --> 00:40:58
enzyme in producing molecules that
are required to build nucleotides in

522
00:40:58 --> 00:41:03
your body, both DNA and
RNA precursors.

523
00:41:03 --> 00:41:06
Without this enzyme you cannot make
those things, you would be dead.

524
00:41:06 --> 00:41:10
It's a very critical enzyme both in
biology and in medicine.

525
00:41:10 --> 00:41:14
Dihydrofolate reductase happens to
be one of the targets of an

526
00:41:14 --> 00:41:18
important chemotherapeutic agent
called Methotrexate.

527
00:41:18 --> 00:41:22
It's used because cancer cells grow
a lot.  You want to inhibit their

528
00:41:22 --> 00:41:26
ability to grow,
so you inhibit their ability to

529
00:41:26 --> 00:41:30
carry out this reaction to produce
this relevant product.

530
00:41:30 --> 00:41:35
And also in bacteria it's the target
for a particular antibiotic called

531
00:41:35 --> 00:41:40
Trimethoprim.  Folic acid you know
that you take in from your diet.

532
00:41:40 --> 00:41:45
And it's then broken down in a way,
or not broken down.  It's modified

533
00:41:45 --> 00:41:51
in a way that it becomes useful for
these synthetic reactions.

534
00:41:51 --> 00:41:56
And that's the job of dihydrofolate
reductase.  Dihydrofolate has two

535
00:41:56 --> 00:42:02
hydrogens positioned at the seven
and eight positions.

536
00:42:02 --> 00:42:06
And tetrahydrofolate has four
hydrogens at these four positions.

537
00:42:06 --> 00:42:11
And it's the tetrahydrofolate that
you want to use,

538
00:42:11 --> 00:42:16
that you need to use for these
subsequent reactions.

539
00:42:16 --> 00:42:21
So the enzyme then, dihydrofolate
reductase adds hydrogens.

540
00:42:21 --> 00:42:26
It reduces dihydrofolate to
tetrahydrofolate.

541
00:42:26 --> 00:42:31
And it utilizes a cofactor NADP
shown in green here to do that.

542
00:42:31 --> 00:42:35
It's the NADP,
NADPH which transfers the hydrogens

543
00:42:35 --> 00:42:39
to the dihydrofolate.
This is a little bit hard to see

544
00:42:39 --> 00:42:43
because it goes pretty quickly.
You might look at it on the Web or

545
00:42:43 --> 00:42:47
at home.  This is the dihydrofolate
coming in.  You can see in white the

546
00:42:47 --> 00:42:51
enzyme actually moving.
It moves in order to carry out the

547
00:42:51 --> 00:42:55
chemical reaction.
And you can see in green the NADP,

548
00:42:55 --> 00:42:59
initially NADPH coming in,
interacting with the dihydrofolate,

549
00:42:59 --> 00:43:03
transferring the hydrogens and
allowing it to become

550
00:43:03 --> 00:43:07
tetrahydrofolate.
OK?  So that's one example of an

551
00:43:07 --> 00:43:13
enzymatic reaction.
OK.  In the final eight minutes,

552
00:43:13 --> 00:43:19
and we do have a lot to get through,
so if you could just hang in there

553
00:43:19 --> 00:43:25
until five of that would be good,
I want to talk about another form of

554
00:43:25 --> 00:43:31
regulation, and that is specifically
the existence of inhibitors

555
00:43:31 --> 00:43:36
and activators.
So, again, the regulation of enzyme

556
00:43:36 --> 00:43:40
function is extremely important.
You want to make sure that the

557
00:43:40 --> 00:43:44
enzyme is working at optimal rates,
higher or lower, depending on the

558
00:43:44 --> 00:43:48
circumstances.
And this can be adjusted naturally

559
00:43:48 --> 00:43:53
inside the cell by other molecules
that can function to inhibit the

560
00:43:53 --> 00:43:57
enzyme or to activate the enzyme.
And, as I said, we can also do that

561
00:43:57 --> 00:44:01
medically by making inhibitors or
activators that change the activity

562
00:44:01 --> 00:44:07
of enzymes inside our cells.
Terminology.  These inhibitors and

563
00:44:07 --> 00:44:13
activators can be reversible or
irreversible.  They can either bind

564
00:44:13 --> 00:44:20
and come off and bind and never come
off.  This takes the enzyme out of

565
00:44:20 --> 00:44:26
play.  It goes to the bench.
It cannot work anymore.  This one

566
00:44:26 --> 00:44:33
can come back off and the enzyme can
continue to function.

567
00:44:33 --> 00:44:37
They can be competitive.
And I'll show you what this means

568
00:44:37 --> 00:44:48
in a second.  Competitive --

569
00:44:48 --> 00:44:52
-- versus noncompetitive.
And, again, I'll tell you what that

570
00:44:52 --> 00:45:01
means in a second.

571
00:45:01 --> 00:45:06
Competitive is illustrated here.
If this is the active site and this

572
00:45:06 --> 00:45:11
is the substrate which would
normally fit into that active site,

573
00:45:11 --> 00:45:16
a competitive inhibitor, like the
name suggests,

574
00:45:16 --> 00:45:21
competes with the active site.
It gets in there and prevents the

575
00:45:21 --> 00:45:26
substrate from binding.
Pretty simple concept, right?

576
00:45:26 --> 00:45:31
A noncompetitive inhibitor
functions by binding somewhere else

577
00:45:31 --> 00:45:36
on the protein and changing the
structure of the active site.

578
00:45:36 --> 00:45:40
So here again is the substrate.
It could bind to this active site,

579
00:45:40 --> 00:45:44
but when the noncompetitive
inhibitor binds over here it changes

580
00:45:44 --> 00:45:49
the active site.
And now the substrate cannot bind.

581
00:45:49 --> 00:45:53
So it's not competing with the
substrate directly,

582
00:45:53 --> 00:45:57
but it's affecting the ability of
the substrate to bind

583
00:45:57 --> 00:46:03
to the active site.
Now, these noncompetitive inhibitors,

584
00:46:03 --> 00:46:09
and you can also have molecules that
activate the enzyme at these other

585
00:46:09 --> 00:46:16
sites, are binding to portions of
the protein that we call allosteric

586
00:46:16 --> 00:46:22
sites.  A term you should be
familiar with,

587
00:46:22 --> 00:46:29
allostery, allosteric regulation.

588
00:46:29 --> 00:46:33
And what this is,
again, are molecules.

589
00:46:33 --> 00:46:37
Sometimes they're products of the
reactions.  Sometimes they are other

590
00:46:37 --> 00:46:41
things that bind somewhere on the
protein, not at the active site,

591
00:46:41 --> 00:46:46
which change the nature of the
active site.  So in this example we

592
00:46:46 --> 00:46:50
see an allosteric site next to an
active site.  The binding of an

593
00:46:50 --> 00:46:54
activator can lock this enzyme,
it happens to have four subunits,

594
00:46:54 --> 00:46:59
into a confirmation where the active
site is open.

595
00:46:59 --> 00:47:03
Or another small molecule,
an inhibitor can bind to the

596
00:47:03 --> 00:47:07
allosteric site and lock the protein
into an inactive confirmation.

597
00:47:07 --> 00:47:11
OK?  So allosteric regulation,
sensing some other molecule and

598
00:47:11 --> 00:47:15
changing the activity of the enzyme.
Why would you want to do that?

599
00:47:15 --> 00:47:19
Before I get to that,
let me give you one real-life

600
00:47:19 --> 00:47:23
example of inhibition.
It comes from my world.

601
00:47:23 --> 00:47:27
Cancer drugs increasingly are
becoming more specific,

602
00:47:27 --> 00:47:31
and this is the best example.
I don't have time to go into it in

603
00:47:31 --> 00:47:35
detail now for lack of time,
but this is a drug made by a local

604
00:47:35 --> 00:47:39
pharmaceutical company called
Novartis which binds to one of these

605
00:47:39 --> 00:47:43
kinases, these phosphorylating
enzymes, important in a particular

606
00:47:43 --> 00:47:46
type of cancer.
It is a competitive inhibitor of

607
00:47:46 --> 00:47:50
ATP.  ATP needs to bind to an active
site for this protein to function.

608
00:47:50 --> 00:47:54
The drug called Gleevec is a
competitive inhibitor of ATP,

609
00:47:54 --> 00:47:58
therefore ATP cannot bind, therefore
the enzyme cannot function,

610
00:47:58 --> 00:48:02
therefore the cancer cells cannot
stay alive, therefore the cancer

611
00:48:02 --> 00:48:06
patient is cured.
Great example.

612
00:48:06 --> 00:48:11
It happens to be true.
So this is not just theory,

613
00:48:11 --> 00:48:15
not just bench biology.  This is
real-life in pharmacy in this

614
00:48:15 --> 00:48:20
example.  And this is a
three-dimensional picture of Gleevec

615
00:48:20 --> 00:48:25
in green bound to the active site of
the kinase called able shown in the

616
00:48:25 --> 00:48:30
red and blue ribbons.
OK.  So, again, feedback regulation.

617
00:48:30 --> 00:48:34
The reason that we have allostery
and changes in regulation relate to

618
00:48:34 --> 00:48:38
a diagram like this.
And the important points here are

619
00:48:38 --> 00:48:43
that these enzymes that we've been
talking about almost never function

620
00:48:43 --> 00:48:47
in isolation.  They're almost always
in pathways.  Something produces

621
00:48:47 --> 00:48:51
product one, the next enzyme works
on product one to make product two,

622
00:48:51 --> 00:48:56
and so on and so forth.  And you
actually, the cell wants to

623
00:48:56 --> 00:49:00
coordinate the activity of these
enzymes so that the right amount of

624
00:49:00 --> 00:49:05
product is made at the bottom
of the process.

625
00:49:05 --> 00:49:08
It's like the regulation of an
assembly line in a factory.

626
00:49:08 --> 00:49:12
You don't want to make too many
tires if you don't have enough cars.

627
00:49:12 --> 00:49:16
So when you have enough tires you
feedback the tire generation and you

628
00:49:16 --> 00:49:20
bump up the car generation.
The same thing happens in biology.

629
00:49:20 --> 00:49:24
This pathway A goes to B goes to C.
C splits to D and F goes to G goes

630
00:49:24 --> 00:49:28
to E.  Depending on how much G you
have, you might feedback on this

631
00:49:28 --> 00:49:32
enzyme to make less F.
And you might feed forward,

632
00:49:32 --> 00:49:37
you might have positive feedback on
this enzyme to make more E.

633
00:49:37 --> 00:49:41
And this regulation is done by this
sort of allosteric process whereby

634
00:49:41 --> 00:49:46
the G product to an allosteric
reaction might inhibit the enzyme

635
00:49:46 --> 00:49:51
producing F and might activate the
enzyme producing E.

636
00:49:51 --> 00:49:55
And this example shown here from an
actual metabolic process,

637
00:49:55 --> 00:50:00
the generation of isoleucine is a
specific example whereby when you

638
00:50:00 --> 00:50:05
make enough isoleucine the
isoleucine will bind back to the

639
00:50:05 --> 00:50:10
enzyme way up here in the pathway to
shut it down.

640
00:50:10 --> 00:50:14
Once I have enough isoleucine,
isoleucine binds to this allosteric

641
00:50:14 --> 00:50:19
site on this enzyme,
which now slows down the production

642
00:50:19 --> 00:50:23
of these intermediates,
and therefore results in the

643
00:50:23 --> 00:50:28
production of less isoleucine.
I left off two slides on energetics

644
00:50:28 --> 00:50:31
and ATP, but I'll mention
those next time.
