1
00:00:18 --> 00:00:24
OK.  Let's get started.
We're going to complete our

2
00:00:24 --> 00:00:30
discussion about mitosis
and meiosis today.

3
00:00:30 --> 00:00:35
And then get into a topic called
Mendelian Genetics,

4
00:00:35 --> 00:00:40
understanding genetic principles.
And we'll give you as examples the

5
00:00:40 --> 00:00:46
work of the famous Austrian monk
Gregor Mendel who sort of set down

6
00:00:46 --> 00:00:51
the rules that we still follow today
regarding simple genetic inheritance.

7
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
So I mentioned to you last time,
and I think you all know that your

8
00:00:57 --> 00:01:01
genes are carried on chromosomes.
And chromosomes come in different

9
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
sizes and shapes.
You have 46 total chromosomes in

10
00:01:05 --> 00:01:09
all of your cells.
Those chromosomes come from your

11
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
parents.  You get one set from one
parent and another set from another

12
00:01:13 --> 00:01:17
parent, so you have 22 pairs plus
the two sex chromosomes.

13
00:01:17 --> 00:01:21
And the chromosomes are made of DNA,
and along those DNA sequences are

14
00:01:21 --> 00:01:25
your genes scattered along the
length of the chromosomes.

15
00:01:25 --> 00:01:29
And there are about 30,000 genes in
total.

16
00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
Now, I've also told you that the
genome, the whole sequence of your

17
00:01:33 --> 00:01:37
DNA has been determined over the
last couple of years.

18
00:01:37 --> 00:01:42
We now know that in great detail.
We know every single nucleotide of

19
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
the three times ten to the ninth
base pairs of DNA,

20
00:01:46 --> 00:01:51
and we can actually go to a website
and look at it.

21
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
You can do this.
It's publicly available,

22
00:01:55 --> 00:01:59
sponsored by the government,
but it's a little like hacking into

23
00:01:59 --> 00:02:04
the database of humanity.
So if you go to this website that I

24
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
just showed you,
you'll find access to the genomes of

25
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
many organisms.
This is an evolutionary tree which

26
00:02:12 --> 00:02:17
shows the relationship of these
organisms from an evolutionary

27
00:02:17 --> 00:02:21
perspective.  There are nine
mammalian genomes that are present

28
00:02:21 --> 00:02:25
within this database.
If you clink on that link to

29
00:02:25 --> 00:02:30
homosapiens, that's us,
assuming this is functioning.

30
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
I had this working.
I'm not sure why it's not working.

31
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
I'm getting a good signal here.  Oh
well.  Had this worked,

32
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
you would have seen an alignment,
a diagram of all the human

33
00:02:42 --> 00:02:47
chromosomes, one through 22,
plus X plus Y.  You could then click

34
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
on chromosome whatever you're
interested, let's say chromosome one.

35
00:02:51 --> 00:02:55
It would show a diagram of
chromosome one from end to end.

36
00:02:55 --> 00:03:00
And you could then click on the
sequence of chromosome one.

37
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
All two point four times ten to the
eighth base pairs of chromosome one.

38
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
It would show you all of the genes
on chromosomes one.

39
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
You would know exactly where they
were.  And you could then click on a

40
00:03:12 --> 00:03:17
particular gene and look at its
sequence.  And it would actually

41
00:03:17 --> 00:03:21
give you information about that gene,
as much information as is known.

42
00:03:21 --> 00:03:25
So, we know the nucleotide sequence
of all the genes.

43
00:03:25 --> 00:03:29
And the question is,
is that sequence that's in that

44
00:03:29 --> 00:03:34
database applicable to all of you?
Is that the sequence of your DNA?

45
00:03:34 --> 00:03:40
What do you say?  Why do you say no?
Right.  So it's somebody's DNA.

46
00:03:40 --> 00:03:46
Actually, the genome sequence
that's present in a publicly

47
00:03:46 --> 00:03:51
available database is a collection
of a small number of people's DNA,

48
00:03:51 --> 00:03:57
but it's a representation of the
human genome.  And you all have

49
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02
subtle differences.
In between genes quite a few,

50
00:04:02 --> 00:04:06
and within your genes some.  And we
call those differences within genes

51
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
allelic differences,
you have different alleles,

52
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
and that's what makes you all
different, which alleles you carry,

53
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
and importantly which combinations
of alleles of genes that you carry.

54
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
OK.  I apologize for that not
working.  I don't know why it didn't.

55
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
All right.  Well,
last time we left off talking about

56
00:04:26 --> 00:04:30
the fact that you inherit your
chromosomes through the process

57
00:04:30 --> 00:04:34
of fertilization.
Fusion of sperm and egg produces a

58
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
diploid cell from two haploid cells.
This diploid cell has two copies of

59
00:04:38 --> 00:04:42
all the chromosomes,
two copies of all the genes,

60
00:04:42 --> 00:04:46
and then through the process of
development there is a great deal of

61
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
mitosis.  We talked about mitosis in
some detail last time.

62
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
The process of chromosome
duplication followed by chromosome

63
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
separation, chromatid separation
really, which allows daughter cells,

64
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
during this process of mitosis to
faithfully inherit all of the DNA.

65
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
And this process continues through
development, and it also continues

66
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
in adults.  It's not over when the
baby is born.  There's a lot of

67
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
mitosis that takes place in many of
your organs, and your intestines for

68
00:05:11 --> 00:05:15
example, your blood.
Not in all of your organs.

69
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
In the brain, for example, there is
relatively little mitosis.

70
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
Once the brain forms, cells don't
divide anymore.

71
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
It's true of the cardiac muscle as
well in the heart.

72
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
But many tissues do continue to
divide.  So this is happening inside

73
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
of you as we speak.
Now, what I want to turn to for

74
00:05:31 --> 00:05:35
today, though,
is to talk about this process.

75
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
How do you go back to the beginning?
How do you generate haploid cells

76
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
from diploid cells?
And this occurs through a related

77
00:05:42 --> 00:05:46
process called meiosis.
Now, meiosis takes place at

78
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
different times,
depending on whether you're male or

79
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
female.  As I mentioned last time in
males meiosis takes place

80
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
in puberty.
So diploid germ cells are set aside

81
00:05:56 --> 00:06:00
in embryogenesis,
but they don't undergo this process

82
00:06:00 --> 00:06:04
of meiosis until males reach puberty
at which point it happens very

83
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
abundantly, as I said,
about a million or a couple of

84
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
million meiotic cells produced per
hour.  In females meiosis actually

85
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
begins in embryogenesis,
quite amazing.  The cells are set

86
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
aside and they start to undergo
meiosis.  And they don't make it all

87
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
the way through.
You don't make haploid germ cells

88
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
in embryogenesis.
They get stuck partway through.

89
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
Then in puberty,
during ovulation a subset of those

90
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
cells continue through the
subsequent stages of meiosis.

91
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
Then they get stuck again.  And
only at fertilization does meiosis

92
00:06:38 --> 00:06:42
get completed,
a haploid cell is produced which is

93
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
then fused with the sperm cell,
a diploid cell is generated and

94
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
development proceeds.
So what is meiosis and how does it

95
00:06:50 --> 00:07:04
compare to mitosis?

96
00:07:04 --> 00:07:11
Well, they're related in the sense
that both of them follow S phase.

97
00:07:11 --> 00:07:19
If you remember during S phase
chromosomes get duplicated.

98
00:07:19 --> 00:07:27
And during chromosome duplication
two chromatids are produced.

99
00:07:27 --> 00:07:38
You're not going to start singing,

100
00:07:38 --> 00:07:46
are you?  No. Just kidding.  When a
chromosome gets produced two

101
00:07:46 --> 00:07:53
chromatids are generated and then
they stick together at the

102
00:07:53 --> 00:08:01
centromere.  Remember that?
Now, in mitosis, as we talked about

103
00:08:01 --> 00:08:09
before, this is followed by one
round of chromatid separation.

104
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
That's all it is.
The chromosomes with their two

105
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
chromatids line up along the
metaphase plate,

106
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
and they get pulled apart during
anaphase and telophase.

107
00:08:20 --> 00:08:24
And importantly the homologs don't
pay any attention to one another.

108
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
The maternal copy of chromosome one
and the paternal copy of chromosome

109
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
two ignore each other in mitosis.
They could be anywhere along that

110
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
metaphase plate.
It doesn't matter.

111
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
They ignore one another.
OK?  That's relevant because it's

112
00:08:37 --> 00:08:45
different in meiosis.

113
00:08:45 --> 00:08:54
In meiosis, also following one round
of chromosome duplication and the

114
00:08:54 --> 00:09:04
generation of two chromatids per
chromosome, this involves one round

115
00:09:04 --> 00:09:11
of chromosome separation.
And when I say chromosome here,

116
00:09:11 --> 00:09:16
I'm talking about the chromosome
which is at this point composed of

117
00:09:16 --> 00:09:22
two chromatids.
In this case the homologs do pay

118
00:09:22 --> 00:09:27
attention to one another and they
separate from one another.

119
00:09:27 --> 00:09:33
Followed by one round of chromatid
separation.

120
00:09:33 --> 00:09:37
Which is very similar to what
happens over here.

121
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41
OK?  So the way you go from having
46 chromosomes to 23 chromosomes is

122
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45
you go through one round of
duplication but two rounds of

123
00:09:45 --> 00:09:50
separation.  The way you maintain 46
chromosomes in mitosis is to go

124
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
through one round of duplication and
only one round of separation.

125
00:09:54 --> 00:09:59
Make sense?  OK.  So let's look at
that in detail.

126
00:09:59 --> 00:10:03
And I won't draw these pictures on
the board for you because,

127
00:10:03 --> 00:10:08
actually, I want to review it in
writing one more time.

128
00:10:08 --> 00:10:12
I'm not going to draw the details
of meiosis for you on the board

129
00:10:12 --> 00:10:17
because it just takes too long,
and the book does a perfectly good

130
00:10:17 --> 00:10:22
job diagramming it for you.
And I'll show you those diagrams in

131
00:10:22 --> 00:10:26
a second.  The terms that we use in
meiosis are the same terms that we

132
00:10:26 --> 00:10:32
use in mitosis.
But there are two rounds,

133
00:10:32 --> 00:10:39
as I mentioned, and they're broken
down by meiosis one and meiosis two.

134
00:10:39 --> 00:10:46
In meiosis one you have a prophase,
and it's called prophase one.

135
00:10:46 --> 00:10:53
You have a prometaphase,
prometaphase one.

136
00:10:53 --> 00:11:00
A metaphase where the chromosomes
align on the metaphase plate.

137
00:11:00 --> 00:11:06
And anaphase where the chromosomes
get pulled apart by the mitotic

138
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
spindle, actually,
in this case the meiotic spindle.

139
00:11:12 --> 00:11:19
And finally a telophase where they
get pulled all the way to the poles.

140
00:11:19 --> 00:11:25
And then there's a second round,
meiosis two, where the same terms

141
00:11:25 --> 00:11:32
are applied but they're
denoted with twos.

142
00:11:32 --> 00:11:36
So there's a second phase of
prophase, of prometaphase,

143
00:11:36 --> 00:11:40
metaphase, anaphase and telophase.
And this is where the chromatids

144
00:11:40 --> 00:11:44
align on the chromosome plate and
get separated.

145
00:11:44 --> 00:11:49
OK?  Now, there's a very key event,
and I'm going to draw it for you

146
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
because it's so important,
that takes place during prophase of

147
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
meiosis one.  And this is the
distinguishing feature between

148
00:11:57 --> 00:12:02
meiosis and mitosis.
As I said in mitosis,

149
00:12:02 --> 00:12:07
the homologs, the two copies of
chromosome one,

150
00:12:07 --> 00:12:12
the maternal one and the paternal
one for example ignore one another.

151
00:12:12 --> 00:12:16
That's not true in mitosis, in
meiosis.  In meiosis they bind to

152
00:12:16 --> 00:12:21
one another.  So imagine again our,
I think I called this the paternal

153
00:12:21 --> 00:12:26
copy of chromosome whatever,
one previously.  It had four genes

154
00:12:26 --> 00:12:32
that we showed previously.
It's represented as two chromatids,

155
00:12:32 --> 00:12:38
which are associated at the
centromere.  And then you have

156
00:12:38 --> 00:12:44
another homolog,
the maternal homolog.

157
00:12:44 --> 00:12:50
It likewise has the same four genes.
It's been duplicated so it's

158
00:12:50 --> 00:12:56
represented as two chromatids held
together at the centromere.

159
00:12:56 --> 00:13:03
In prophase of meiosis one,
these homologs pair.

160
00:13:03 --> 00:13:10
And it's the pairing of the homologs

161
00:13:10 --> 00:13:15
that allows the two to separate
faithfully during meiosis one.

162
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
They also interact in an
interesting way that we'll come to

163
00:13:19 --> 00:13:24
in a moment.  They don't just pair.
They actually undergo interactions

164
00:13:24 --> 00:13:29
between each other which allows them
to exchange sequences which is

165
00:13:29 --> 00:13:34
critical for generating diversity
amongst our chromosomes.

166
00:13:34 --> 00:13:38
So now I'm going to take you through
these steps as shown in your book.

167
00:13:38 --> 00:13:43
This is figure 9.14 in your book.
We're going to go through meiosis

168
00:13:43 --> 00:13:47
one first.  So in prophase of
meiosis one, we've undergone

169
00:13:47 --> 00:13:52
chromosome duplication already into
the chromatids.

170
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
Now the chromosomes are going to
condense, and you can see that here.

171
00:13:56 --> 00:14:01
And importantly during prophase the
two chromosomes,

172
00:14:01 --> 00:14:06
represented by the four chromatids
align.

173
00:14:06 --> 00:14:10
In this picture you're seeing two
different chromosomes,

174
00:14:10 --> 00:14:14
a larger one and a smaller one.
And you can see that the maternal

175
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
and paternal copies have paired with
one another.  OK?

176
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
So we get pairs of homologs.
Still later in prophase they

177
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
interact in this other fashion that
I just alluded to where they

178
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
actually exchange information.
They exchange genetic information.

179
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
And we'll go through this in a
little bit more detail in a bit.

180
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
At metaphase of meiosis one,
metaphase one,

181
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
the homologs line up on the
metaphase plate with one homolog to

182
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
the left, the other homolog to the
right, one homolog to the left,

183
00:14:44 --> 00:14:48
the other homolog to the right.
This is one of two possible

184
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
configurations that could take place
here.  In fact,

185
00:14:51 --> 00:14:55
in another cell undergoing metaphase
one, the red one might be on the

186
00:14:55 --> 00:14:59
left, the blue one on the right,
but here the blue one might be one

187
00:14:59 --> 00:15:03
the left, the red one might
be on the right.

188
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
And that's important.
You'll see why later.

189
00:15:07 --> 00:15:12
So the homologs line up along the
metaphase plate.

190
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
And now during anaphase one the
homologs separate from one another.

191
00:15:16 --> 00:15:21
The two chromatids of each homolog
separate from one another,

192
00:15:21 --> 00:15:26
and that's completed in telophase.
Now, without an intervening round

193
00:15:26 --> 00:15:30
of DNA duplication,
this does not involve another round

194
00:15:30 --> 00:15:35
of S phase, we go straight into
meiosis two where again the DNA

195
00:15:35 --> 00:15:40
condenses, a mitotic
spindle is built.

196
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
And now, just like in mitosis,
the two chromatids line up along the

197
00:15:44 --> 00:15:48
metaphase plate with one chromatid
to the top, the other chromatid to

198
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
the bottom, one chromatid to the top,
the other to the bottom.

199
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
And then they get separated during
anaphase and telophase

200
00:15:56 --> 00:16:02
of meiosis two.
The end product of that are germ

201
00:16:02 --> 00:16:09
cells which are now haploid.
They have only one copy of each of

202
00:16:09 --> 00:16:15
the chromosomes,
one of the big ones and one of the

203
00:16:15 --> 00:16:22
small ones.  So that's how you go
from a cell that has two copies of

204
00:16:22 --> 00:16:29
each to a cell that has one copy of
each.  One round of DNA duplication,

205
00:16:29 --> 00:16:36
two rounds of chromosome or
chromatid separation.

206
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
Now, importantly you'll see if you
can squint a little bit,

207
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
that the chromosomes that come out
of this process of meiosis don't

208
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
always look, in fact,
never look like the chromosomes that

209
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
come in.  They undergo this process
of exchange of genetic information.

210
00:16:44 --> 00:16:54
This process of exchange of genetic

211
00:16:54 --> 00:16:58
information is called meiotic
recombination.

212
00:16:58 --> 00:17:08
And I'll show it to you in a figure

213
00:17:08 --> 00:17:14
in a second.  But it generates first
recombinant chromatids,

214
00:17:14 --> 00:17:20
chromatids that look different from
the chromatids that were generated

215
00:17:20 --> 00:17:26
initially.  That's why they're
called recombinant.

216
00:17:26 --> 00:17:32
And these, when resolved during
meiosis two, generate recombinant

217
00:17:32 --> 00:17:40
chromosomes.

218
00:17:40 --> 00:17:48
So, again, if we imagine our two
homologs of a given chromosome with

219
00:17:48 --> 00:17:56
the four genes that we talked about
previously lined up along the length

220
00:17:56 --> 00:18:04
of those chromosomes,
during this process of meiotic

221
00:18:04 --> 00:18:20
recombination --

222
00:18:20 --> 00:18:29
-- new versions of the chromosomes
are produced.  We can generate a

223
00:18:29 --> 00:18:39
chromosome which has a little bit of
Dad's DNA and a little

224
00:18:39 --> 00:18:46
bit of Mom's DNA.
A chromosome that was generated

225
00:18:46 --> 00:18:51
specifically in you.
It's your unique contribution to

226
00:18:51 --> 00:18:56
the offspring.
It's not solely what you got from

227
00:18:56 --> 00:19:01
Mom or Dad.  It's your unique
version of that chromosome that's a

228
00:19:01 --> 00:19:07
hybrid between what you got from Mom
and what you go from Dad.

229
00:19:07 --> 00:19:11
And this process of meiotic
recombination allows for the

230
00:19:11 --> 00:19:15
increased diversity in the
population.  You don't just pass on

231
00:19:15 --> 00:19:19
what you inherited.
You actually mix it up a little bit

232
00:19:19 --> 00:19:23
and pass on new combinations of the
alleles that you got from your

233
00:19:23 --> 00:19:27
parents.  So this is shown in
greater detail here.

234
00:19:27 --> 00:19:32
And, again, gone through in much
detail in your book.

235
00:19:32 --> 00:19:36
This is figure 9.
6.  Here we are in prophase of

236
00:19:36 --> 00:19:41
meiosis one.  The homologs have
paired and they've undergone a

237
00:19:41 --> 00:19:45
genetic interaction.
The DNA of the paternal and the

238
00:19:45 --> 00:19:50
maternal chromatids have literally
exchanged information.

239
00:19:50 --> 00:19:55
That's what this crossover is
called.  It's referred to as a

240
00:19:55 --> 00:20:00
chiasma.  And you can literally see
it in the electron microscope.

241
00:20:00 --> 00:20:04
When this gets resolved,
like a cut and paste reaction.

242
00:20:04 --> 00:20:08
When this gets resolved, you
generate new chromatids.

243
00:20:08 --> 00:20:12
This chromatid has mostly red
sequence but a little bit of blue

244
00:20:12 --> 00:20:16
sequence.  And this chromatid has
mostly blue sequence and a little

245
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20
bit of red sequence.
If you think about that with

246
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
respect to genes in our analogy over
here, the red chromosome had alleles

247
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
that we'll refer to as the white
versions of gene one,

248
00:20:28 --> 00:20:32
two, three and four.
The blue homolog had the black

249
00:20:32 --> 00:20:36
versions of genes one,
two, three and four.  The products

250
00:20:36 --> 00:20:41
of this reaction include chromatids
that look just like the parental

251
00:20:41 --> 00:20:45
ones, a red chromosome with white
one, two, three and four,

252
00:20:45 --> 00:20:49
a black chromosome with, a blue
chromosome with black one,

253
00:20:49 --> 00:20:54
two, three and four, but also new
chromatids that didn't exist

254
00:20:54 --> 00:20:58
previously, a red one with white one,
two, three but a black four,

255
00:20:58 --> 00:21:03
and a blue one with black one two
and three and a white four.

256
00:21:03 --> 00:21:13
New versions of the chromosomes.
And this is important.  It's

257
00:21:13 --> 00:21:23
important for you to understand how
genetics works,

258
00:21:23 --> 00:21:34
but it's also important for the
species to generate increased

259
00:21:34 --> 00:21:44
diversity which when acted upon by
natural selection forces might

260
00:21:44 --> 00:21:54
select out more fit organisms.
So that is mitosis, meiosis and

261
00:21:54 --> 00:22:02
meiotic recombination.
And we'll be drawing on your

262
00:22:02 --> 00:22:06
knowledge of meiosis and mitotic
recombination to understand the

263
00:22:06 --> 00:22:11
principles of genetics.
And that will be the next topic

264
00:22:11 --> 00:22:16
that we turn to.
Before I do so I want to just

265
00:22:16 --> 00:22:20
mention that this process of meiosis
doesn't always work perfectly.

266
00:22:20 --> 00:22:25
No biological system works
perfectly.  There's always some

267
00:22:25 --> 00:22:29
error rate.  And that's true in
meiosis in germ cell development,

268
00:22:29 --> 00:22:34
although it's supposed to be the
case that during metaphase one the

269
00:22:34 --> 00:22:39
homologs, which are paired together,
separate to the two daughters.

270
00:22:39 --> 00:22:44
That doesn't always happen.
Occasionally errors take place such

271
00:22:44 --> 00:22:50
that one daughter gets nothing and
the other daughter gets both copies.

272
00:22:50 --> 00:22:55
This is a problem because now when
these guys go through meiosis two

273
00:22:55 --> 00:23:01
they have two copies of a given
chromosome instead of just one.

274
00:23:01 --> 00:23:05
And if those germ cells,
in this case they're eggs,

275
00:23:05 --> 00:23:10
and that's usually the problem in
humans where it occurs,

276
00:23:10 --> 00:23:14
if those eggs get fused by a sperm
that carries its own copy of that

277
00:23:14 --> 00:23:19
chromosome the zygote,
instead of having just two copies,

278
00:23:19 --> 00:23:24
has three.  And this is a situation
called trisomy,

279
00:23:24 --> 00:23:29
an extra copy of a given chromosome.
The opposite can happen as well.

280
00:23:29 --> 00:23:32
This guy, this egg,
if it were to be fertilized would

281
00:23:32 --> 00:23:36
have only a single copy of that
given chromosome.

282
00:23:36 --> 00:23:40
That would be monosomy,
single instead of two.  This does

283
00:23:40 --> 00:23:44
happen during human development.
In the vast majority of cases when

284
00:23:44 --> 00:23:48
it happens it's incompatible with
early development and the fetus

285
00:23:48 --> 00:23:52
aborts.  There are a few examples
where the fetus can actually make it

286
00:23:52 --> 00:23:56
quite late in gestation and even be
born but then doesn't

287
00:23:56 --> 00:24:00
thrive thereafter.
But there's one example where the

288
00:24:00 --> 00:24:04
fetus comes to term,
is born and the individual can

289
00:24:04 --> 00:24:08
survive, and that's chromosome 21
trisomy or Down syndrome.

290
00:24:08 --> 00:24:12
This happens when during meiosis
one nondisjunction takes place such

291
00:24:12 --> 00:24:17
that two copies of chromosome 21
wind up in an egg.

292
00:24:17 --> 00:24:21
Sperm comes along and delivers
another copy of chromosome 21.

293
00:24:21 --> 00:24:25
Now that zygote is trisomic for
chromosome 21.

294
00:24:25 --> 00:24:30
And you can see the karyotype here.

295
00:24:30 --> 00:24:34
Everything else is diploid but this
has three copies of chromosome 21.

296
00:24:34 --> 00:24:38
And this leads to a characteristic
defect in development which results

297
00:24:38 --> 00:24:42
in an individual with very
characteristic features.

298
00:24:42 --> 00:24:46
And this extra copy of 21 is
responsible for this too much gene

299
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
product from the genes on chromosome
21.  And I don't remember how many

300
00:24:50 --> 00:24:54
there are.  There are 600 or so
genes on chromosome 21.

301
00:24:54 --> 00:24:58
Having too much of some or some of
them, some combination of them,

302
00:24:58 --> 00:25:02
too much product from those leads to
defects in development,

303
00:25:02 --> 00:25:06
which results in this very clear
phenotype.

304
00:25:06 --> 00:25:10
So meiosis usually insures that you
get just one copy of each

305
00:25:10 --> 00:25:15
chromosomes, but it doesn't always
work.  And this can be one

306
00:25:15 --> 00:25:19
consequence.  OK.
Let's take a breath and change

307
00:25:19 --> 00:25:24
gears.  So we're going to move now
from mitosis and meiosis to genetics

308
00:25:24 --> 00:25:29
and genetic principles,
and specifically Mendelian genetics.

309
00:25:29 --> 00:25:32
So what we want to now begin to
understand is besides the mechanics,

310
00:25:32 --> 00:25:36
what are the consequences?  What
happens when you inherit alleles of

311
00:25:36 --> 00:25:40
given genes?  What is the effect of
the inheritance of those alleles and

312
00:25:40 --> 00:25:44
what are the principles that guide
that?  Why is it that when a child

313
00:25:44 --> 00:25:47
is born of two blue-eyed people that
child has blue eyes?

314
00:25:47 --> 00:25:51
When a child is born of a
brown-eyed person and blue-eyes

315
00:25:51 --> 00:25:55
person that child is likely to have
brown eyes, but not always.

316
00:25:55 --> 00:25:59
Maybe they'd have blue eyes.
What governs the presentation of a

317
00:25:59 --> 00:26:03
given trait based on the genes that
that individual inherits?

318
00:26:03 --> 00:26:06
Or more precisely the alleles of the
genes that individual inherits.

319
00:26:06 --> 00:26:10
You might actually be able to see
that the murderer can be seen in the

320
00:26:10 --> 00:26:13
reflection of this person's eye
right here.  You've got to look

321
00:26:13 --> 00:26:17
carefully.  We can learn a lot about
this by looking at inheritance

322
00:26:17 --> 00:26:20
patterns in humans.
And that's increasingly powerful

323
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
given our knowledge of the human
genome today.  There's a lot more we

324
00:26:24 --> 00:26:28
can do in human genetics today than
we could have done ten years ago.

325
00:26:28 --> 00:26:32
But the field has actually been
brought along to this point using

326
00:26:32 --> 00:26:36
genetics in model organisms.
And this is a fly, a fruit fly,

327
00:26:36 --> 00:26:40
drosophila melanogaster, a major
genetic organism in biology.

328
00:26:40 --> 00:26:44
And you can see again that you can
isolate flies with different colored

329
00:26:44 --> 00:26:48
eyes, red eyes,
white eyes, dark eyes.

330
00:26:48 --> 00:26:52
And you can understand the
principles of genetics by crossing,

331
00:26:52 --> 00:26:56
mating flies together and looking at
what happens in the eye color of the

332
00:26:56 --> 00:27:00
offspring of flies that start off
with a given eye color.

333
00:27:00 --> 00:27:05
Now, the principles that guide us in
our thinking about genetics derive

334
00:27:05 --> 00:27:10
from this individual here whose name
is Gregor Mendel.

335
00:27:10 --> 00:27:15
And the principles that he laid
down are referred to as Mendelian

336
00:27:15 --> 00:27:21
inheritance.  And he,
through work that I'll briefly

337
00:27:21 --> 00:27:26
summarize, developed certain laws of
inheritance which turned

338
00:27:26 --> 00:27:31
out to be true.
And we use them even now as we think

339
00:27:31 --> 00:27:35
about how genes and alleles get
passed on through the generations.

340
00:27:35 --> 00:27:40
Mendel lived in the 1800s.  He did
his work around 1850s,

341
00:27:40 --> 00:27:44
1860s.  His organism was the pea
plant and the peas that give rise to

342
00:27:44 --> 00:27:48
the pea plant.
And he spent a lot of time

343
00:27:48 --> 00:27:53
observing peas and pea plants,
breading or crossing pea plants

344
00:27:53 --> 00:27:57
together, looking at the products of
those crosses and coming

345
00:27:57 --> 00:28:01
up with these theories.
He published a paper on that work in,

346
00:28:01 --> 00:28:04
I think, 1865,
and it was roundly ignored.

347
00:28:04 --> 00:28:07
Nobody paid any attention.  I
should have mentioned that he was an

348
00:28:07 --> 00:28:10
Austrian monk.
He lived up in the hills in Austria

349
00:28:10 --> 00:28:13
and did his work largely in
seclusion.  But he did,

350
00:28:13 --> 00:28:16
in fact, publish a paper in 1865
reporting his principles of

351
00:28:16 --> 00:28:19
inheritance.  And he was largely
ignored until about 50 years later

352
00:28:19 --> 00:28:22
when other workers started to do
similar things and basically

353
00:28:22 --> 00:28:25
rediscovered these principles that
he had laid down so many years

354
00:28:25 --> 00:28:28
before.  And we now give him credit
for coming up with these principles

355
00:28:28 --> 00:28:32
in the first place.
So Mendel focused on traits,

356
00:28:32 --> 00:28:37
traits that he could observe in the
pea plant or in the peas themselves.

357
00:28:37 --> 00:28:42
And this is an example of the
traits that he might look at.

358
00:28:42 --> 00:28:47
You may know that peas can come in
different shapes and textures.

359
00:28:47 --> 00:28:52
There are peas that are smooth.
There are peas that are wrinkled.

360
00:28:52 --> 00:28:57
And Mendel wondered what controlled
whether a pea was smooth

361
00:28:57 --> 00:29:01
or wrinkled.
If you crossed a pea plant that

362
00:29:01 --> 00:29:04
would have produced smooth peas with
a pea plant that would have produced

363
00:29:04 --> 00:29:08
wrinkled peas,
do you get smooth or wrinkled peas?

364
00:29:08 --> 00:29:11
The principles that guided the
thinking previously were that this

365
00:29:11 --> 00:29:14
was some sort of a mixture.
If you had one type and another

366
00:29:14 --> 00:29:18
type, the offspring would have some
intermediate type.

367
00:29:18 --> 00:29:21
There was sort of a mixing of
genetic information,

368
00:29:21 --> 00:29:24
not really referred to as genetic
information at the time,

369
00:29:24 --> 00:29:28
but heritable information.
And Mendel wondered whether that

370
00:29:28 --> 00:29:32
was true.
And then he actually determined that

371
00:29:32 --> 00:29:36
for most things that was not true.
One type determined the appearance

372
00:29:36 --> 00:29:41
of the trait in the offspring.
In order for you to understand what

373
00:29:41 --> 00:29:46
Mendel did, you have to understand a
little bit about pea plants and peas.

374
00:29:46 --> 00:29:50
One thing you need to know is that
peas are the embryo.

375
00:29:50 --> 00:29:55
They are the product of
fertilization.

376
00:29:55 --> 00:30:00
And when you plant a pea it will
develop into a pea plant.

377
00:30:00 --> 00:30:04
And you can score traits either in
the pea itself,

378
00:30:04 --> 00:30:09
in the embryo, smooth,
wrinkled, dark green, light green,

379
00:30:09 --> 00:30:13
or in the pea plant that results
from that pea.

380
00:30:13 --> 00:30:18
Does it have red flowers or white
flowers or pink flowers?

381
00:30:18 --> 00:30:23
And importantly you also can
fertilize one pea plant from another.

382
00:30:23 --> 00:30:27
You can take the germ cells,
the male germ cells or male gametes

383
00:30:27 --> 00:30:32
from one pea plant,
and purposely fertilize a female

384
00:30:32 --> 00:30:37
gamete of another pea plant.
You can carry out these very precise

385
00:30:37 --> 00:30:41
crosses.  Or you can do it within
the same pea plant.

386
00:30:41 --> 00:30:45
You can take the male germ cells or
gametes and fertilize the female

387
00:30:45 --> 00:30:49
gametes from that same plant,
so-called self-pollination.  OK?

388
00:30:49 --> 00:30:53
And through this methodology,
Mendel was able to very precisely

389
00:30:53 --> 00:30:57
control what the pea plants looked
like and how he could

390
00:30:57 --> 00:31:07
manipulate them.

391
00:31:07 --> 00:31:12
Through this process of
self-pollination,

392
00:31:12 --> 00:31:18
Mendel was able to generate what he
called “pure breading strains”.

393
00:31:18 --> 00:31:23
That is they always produced the
same trait.  If you cross them

394
00:31:23 --> 00:31:29
together, if you fertilize,
self-fertilize them, you always got

395
00:31:29 --> 00:31:34
the same result,
always smooth peas or always

396
00:31:34 --> 00:31:40
wrinkled peas or always red flowers
or always white flowers.

397
00:31:40 --> 00:31:43
They were pure.
There wasn't any heterogeneity.

398
00:31:43 --> 00:31:46
And we're going to refer to these
in our discussion as

399
00:31:46 --> 00:31:55
parental strains.

400
00:31:55 --> 00:32:02
And kind of an example of a question
that Mendel would want to know is if

401
00:32:02 --> 00:32:09
you took two parental strains and he
crossed pollinated from one that

402
00:32:09 --> 00:32:16
always produced smooth peas,
and here we're talking about this X

403
00:32:16 --> 00:32:23
represents crossing fertilization,
with a plant that always produced

404
00:32:23 --> 00:32:30
wrinkled peas, what did the
offspring look like?

405
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
What did the pea look like in the
product of that cross?

406
00:32:36 --> 00:32:43
These parental strains are referred
to as P.  The product of a cross

407
00:32:43 --> 00:32:49
between two parental strains is
called the F1 or first

408
00:32:49 --> 00:33:02
filial generation.

409
00:33:02 --> 00:33:08
And the question Mendel wanted to
know was what is the P type in the

410
00:33:08 --> 00:33:14
F1?  The answer turns out,
for this particular example,

411
00:33:14 --> 00:33:20
to be smooth peas.  And the question
is why?  Based on this kind of

412
00:33:20 --> 00:33:27
observation, Mendel generated
a hypothesis.

413
00:33:27 --> 00:33:47
He suggested that traits in the peas,

414
00:33:47 --> 00:34:02
as well as in the subsequent plants,
arise from the inheritance of two

415
00:34:02 --> 00:34:12
units.
These units we would think of now as

416
00:34:12 --> 00:34:18
two alleles of a given gene.
He wasn't thinking of genes or

417
00:34:18 --> 00:34:23
alleles.  He was just thinking of
what number of things was

418
00:34:23 --> 00:34:29
contributing to this particular
trait.  And that these two units

419
00:34:29 --> 00:34:35
were delivered to the embryo
from each parent.

420
00:34:35 --> 00:34:49
And importantly the parent then has

421
00:34:49 --> 00:35:03
two units so that each parent
delivers one of its two alleles to

422
00:35:03 --> 00:35:17
the offspring via the production
of germ cells.

423
00:35:17 --> 00:35:20
So everybody has two.
They pass on one of those two to

424
00:35:20 --> 00:35:24
their germ cells.
And then the embryo is the product

425
00:35:24 --> 00:35:28
of two germ cells coming together
generating, once again,

426
00:35:28 --> 00:35:36
something with two units.  OK?

427
00:35:36 --> 00:35:41
So let's think about this with
respect to pea plants,

428
00:35:41 --> 00:35:46
and specifically the shape of the
peas.  So the trait that we're

429
00:35:46 --> 00:35:52
interested in is smooth
or wrinkled peas.

430
00:35:52 --> 00:36:03
The gene, in our language,

431
00:36:03 --> 00:36:10
is the S gene.  It is going to
determine whether or not the pea is

432
00:36:10 --> 00:36:18
smooth or wrinkled.
And this gene comes in two

433
00:36:18 --> 00:36:25
varieties, two alleles.
One is called big S and the other

434
00:36:25 --> 00:36:32
is called little S.
In the cross that was done,

435
00:36:32 --> 00:36:39
the plant that always generated
smooth peas, which was a pure

436
00:36:39 --> 00:36:46
breeding strain,
had the same allele in both copies.

437
00:36:46 --> 00:36:53
It was diploid for the big S allele.
Both of its chromosomes that carry

438
00:36:53 --> 00:37:00
the S gene had the big S
version of that gene.

439
00:37:00 --> 00:37:07
And the wrinkled plant,
the plant that produced wrinkled

440
00:37:07 --> 00:37:15
peas carried two copies of the other
allele, little S.

441
00:37:15 --> 00:37:23
These plants produced smooth peas.
These plants produced wrinkled peas.

442
00:37:23 --> 00:37:31
When these plants produced germ
cells, what allele of this gene gets

443
00:37:31 --> 00:37:38
put into those germ cells?
Big S.  It's the only one there.

444
00:37:38 --> 00:37:45
So when these plants undergo
meiosis they're going to produce

445
00:37:45 --> 00:37:53
germ cells that carry in them the
big S gene.  When these plants

446
00:37:53 --> 00:38:00
undergo meiosis what allele of the S
gene did they put in their

447
00:38:00 --> 00:38:07
germ cells?  Little S.
These haploid germ cells have the

448
00:38:07 --> 00:38:13
little S gene.
Now, when I cross,

449
00:38:13 --> 00:38:19
I take one of these germ cells,
mix it with one of those germ cells

450
00:38:19 --> 00:38:25
in the cross, what gene,
what genes, what alleles does that

451
00:38:25 --> 00:38:33
offspring inherit?
It gets a big S from here and it

452
00:38:33 --> 00:38:41
gets a little S from here.
OK?  And what do I observe when I

453
00:38:41 --> 00:38:49
make an organism,
a pea, that looks like that?

454
00:38:49 --> 00:38:58
What does the trait look like?
It's smooth.  OK.

455
00:38:58 --> 00:39:04
Now, I've drawn details without
given you some of the relevant

456
00:39:04 --> 00:39:11
nomenclature.  The parental strain
over here had big S,

457
00:39:11 --> 00:39:18
big S.  We call that the genotype.
A genotype refers to which alleles

458
00:39:18 --> 00:39:25
you have; your genotype.
The genotype of the other parental

459
00:39:25 --> 00:39:32
strain is S, S.
And the genotype of the offspring is

460
00:39:32 --> 00:39:39
big S, little S.
That's the genotype.

461
00:39:39 --> 00:39:46
If you have two of the same alleles
it is called being homozygous.

462
00:39:46 --> 00:39:53
This also has two of the same
alleles so it is also homozygous for

463
00:39:53 --> 00:40:00
the other allele but
still homozygous.

464
00:40:00 --> 00:40:08
If you have one allele of one type
and the other allele you are called

465
00:40:08 --> 00:40:16
heterozygous.  OK.
So that's some relevant terminology.

466
00:40:16 --> 00:40:24
Now, in contrast to the genotype,
we also refer to the phenotype.  And

467
00:40:24 --> 00:40:33
the phenotype refers to the
manifestation of the trait.

468
00:40:33 --> 00:40:40
What you look like.
Regardless of what the gene

469
00:40:40 --> 00:40:47
combination or allele combination
you have, what do you actually look

470
00:40:47 --> 00:40:54
like?  So what is the phenotype of
these peas?  Smooth.

471
00:40:54 --> 00:41:02
And what is the phenotype of these
peas?  They're wrinkled.

472
00:41:02 --> 00:41:09
And what is the phenotype of these
peas?  They're smooth.

473
00:41:09 --> 00:41:17
Based on the patterns that he
observed when he crossed two pure

474
00:41:17 --> 00:41:25
breading strains and generated
offspring that resembled one of the

475
00:41:25 --> 00:41:33
two pure breading strains,
Mendel suggested that in this

476
00:41:33 --> 00:41:41
particular cross the big S unit,
we would call it allele, is dominant

477
00:41:41 --> 00:41:48
over little S.
If you have a big S allele,

478
00:41:48 --> 00:41:54
regardless of what you have as the
other allele, you're going to have

479
00:41:54 --> 00:42:00
the big S trait which is smooth.
Big S is dominant over little S.

480
00:42:00 --> 00:42:06
And a related term,
little S is recessive to big S.

481
00:42:06 --> 00:42:13
The only way you observe the
phenotype associated with the little

482
00:42:13 --> 00:42:20
S allele is if you're homozygous for
the little S.  If you're

483
00:42:20 --> 00:42:27
heterozygous, as in the case in the
middle, you manifest the phenotype

484
00:42:27 --> 00:42:34
associated with the other allele.
Dominance and recessive.

485
00:42:34 --> 00:42:41
OK.  Now, based on these ideas of
inheritance of a single unit or

486
00:42:41 --> 00:42:47
allele from the parents who carry
two and the concept of dominance and

487
00:42:47 --> 00:42:54
recessiveness,
you can come up with methods for

488
00:42:54 --> 00:43:01
determining the frequency of
observing genotypes and phenotypes

489
00:43:01 --> 00:43:08
in crosses such as this.
So I want to consider now not a

490
00:43:08 --> 00:43:16
parental cross giving rise to an F1,
but rather a cross between F1.  We

491
00:43:16 --> 00:43:24
call this a hybrid cross.
And because we're focusing on one

492
00:43:24 --> 00:43:32
gene we actually call it
a monohybrid cross.

493
00:43:32 --> 00:43:44
The genotypes of the plants that

494
00:43:44 --> 00:43:49
we're going to start with in the F1
generation are as we described

495
00:43:49 --> 00:43:54
previously.  They're heterozygous
big S, little S.

496
00:43:54 --> 00:44:00
And that's true for one plant and
the other.

497
00:44:00 --> 00:44:07
They're both F1s.
They're both heterozygous for big S,

498
00:44:07 --> 00:44:14
little S.  If we now cross these
together, we can think about what

499
00:44:14 --> 00:44:22
germ cells these plants produce.
So what are the four products of

500
00:44:22 --> 00:44:29
meiosis look like from this?
What do you get in the meiotic

501
00:44:29 --> 00:44:37
products starting with
these genotypes?

502
00:44:37 --> 00:44:43
Two of them get big S,
two of them get little S.

503
00:44:43 --> 00:44:49
And likewise over here.  Two of the
germ cells get big S,

504
00:44:49 --> 00:44:55
two of the germ cells get little S.
Therefore, half of the germ cells

505
00:44:55 --> 00:45:01
are big S, half are little S.
If I think about the frequency of

506
00:45:01 --> 00:45:06
big S germ cells it's one-half.
If I think of the frequency of

507
00:45:06 --> 00:45:12
little S germ cells it's one-half.
And likewise over here, half of the

508
00:45:12 --> 00:45:17
germ cells are big S,
half of the germ cells are little S.

509
00:45:17 --> 00:45:23
Based on this idea I can generate a
grid --

510
00:45:23 --> 00:45:32
-- which will allow me to calculate

511
00:45:32 --> 00:45:37
the frequency of offspring that have
four different combinations.

512
00:45:37 --> 00:45:43
If this germ cell combines with
this germ cell I'll be big S,

513
00:45:43 --> 00:45:48
big S.  If this germ cell combines
with this germ cell the genotype

514
00:45:48 --> 00:45:53
will be big S,
little S.  If this germ cell

515
00:45:53 --> 00:45:59
combines with this germ cell the
genotype will be little

516
00:45:59 --> 00:46:04
S, little S.
And if this germ cell combines with

517
00:46:04 --> 00:46:08
this germ cell the genotype will be
big S, little S.

518
00:46:08 --> 00:46:13
This box, which is a useful device
for calculating the frequency of the

519
00:46:13 --> 00:46:17
genotypes that you observe in
different crosses,

520
00:46:17 --> 00:46:31
is referred to as a Punnett Square.

521
00:46:31 --> 00:46:36
So let's think about what the
numbers would be in such a

522
00:46:36 --> 00:46:42
monohybrid cross.
There are three possible genotypes.

523
00:46:42 --> 00:46:48
If you look at the Punnett Square
there are three possible genotypes.

524
00:46:48 --> 00:46:54
You can be homozygous big S, big S.
You can be homozygous little S,

525
00:46:54 --> 00:47:00
little S.  Or you can be
heterozygous big S, little S.

526
00:47:00 --> 00:47:07
Those are the three possible
genotypes from a cross such as this.

527
00:47:07 --> 00:47:15
The ratio of those genotypes, if
you look in the Punnett Square is

528
00:47:15 --> 00:47:23
there is one of these for every one
of these and two of these.

529
00:47:23 --> 00:47:31
The ratio of the three genotypes is
1:2:1 as determined by this

530
00:47:31 --> 00:47:37
kind of calculation.
The reason that you get that ratio

531
00:47:37 --> 00:47:43
is that a quarter of these,
sorry.  Half of these germ cells are

532
00:47:43 --> 00:47:48
big S, half of these germ cells are
big S, so a quarter plus,

533
00:47:48 --> 00:47:54
times a quarter, sorry, sorry,
sorry, I said that wrong.  Half of

534
00:47:54 --> 00:48:00
these germ cells are big S.
Half of those germ cells are big S.

535
00:48:00 --> 00:48:05
So a half times a half is a quarter.
Half of these germ cells are little

536
00:48:05 --> 00:48:10
S.  Half of these germ cells are
little S.  The probability of

537
00:48:10 --> 00:48:15
getting one of each is a half times
a half or a quarter.

538
00:48:15 --> 00:48:20
For big S, little S you can do it
two different ways,

539
00:48:20 --> 00:48:26
so it's a quarter plus a quarter or
a half.

540
00:48:26 --> 00:48:35
The ratio of these fractions is

541
00:48:35 --> 00:48:42
1:2:1 which determines the products
that you see.  Now,

542
00:48:42 --> 00:48:49
before I let you go,
I want you think about the

543
00:48:49 --> 00:48:56
phenotypes.  The phenotypes that you
observe in these peas is smooth,

544
00:48:56 --> 00:49:03
in these peas is smooth and in these
peas wrinkled.

545
00:49:03 --> 00:49:07
So the ratio of phenotypes is 2:1.
You'll need to think about why

546
00:49:07 --> 00:49:12
those, sorry, sorry,
two plus one is three,

547
00:49:12 --> 00:49:16
3:1.  You'll need to think about why
those principles give rise to these

548
00:49:16 --> 00:49:19
calculations and these frequencies.
