1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
So we're going to talk about prions
today and prion diseases which is a

2
00:00:19 --> 00:00:23
fascinating subject and one,
again, of potential medical

3
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
significance.  We'll see how it
plays out in time,

4
00:00:27 --> 00:00:31
but there's a great deal of concern
out there about prions and the

5
00:00:31 --> 00:00:36
diseases that they cause.
Before we do, I mentioned last time

6
00:00:36 --> 00:00:40
at the end of the lecture about the
hope that we can develop vaccines

7
00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
for HIV.  And there's a great deal
of effort going on in this country

8
00:00:44 --> 00:00:48
and around the world to do that.
That would clearly be the best

9
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
thing to do, to prevent HIV rather
than trying to treat it.

10
00:00:52 --> 00:00:56
And there are a number of
strategies that are underway.

11
00:00:56 --> 00:01:00
Some have been tested in animal
models of the disease.

12
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
So far nothing has worked.
So there are no vaccines or

13
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
effective vaccines for HIV.
And this just gives you a list of

14
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
what's being tried.
And I put this up in part to remind

15
00:01:10 --> 00:01:14
you of the traditional vaccine
strategies.  More or less everything

16
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
that can be tried is being tried for
HIV, including the development of

17
00:01:17 --> 00:01:21
what we call attenuated strains.
Strains of the virus which, in

18
00:01:21 --> 00:01:25
theory at least,
should be able to replicate but

19
00:01:25 --> 00:01:29
might not be pathogenic.
We can take the virus,

20
00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
cut out some essential genes.
It will still replicate but it

21
00:01:33 --> 00:01:37
won't cause disease.
In theory that would be helpful.

22
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
One could also take the inactivated
HIV approach.  Take some live virus,

23
00:01:41 --> 00:01:45
kill it either with heat or with,
say, formaldehyde,

24
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
and use that as the immunogen.
Once could take the component

25
00:01:49 --> 00:01:53
vaccine strategy,
that is using recombinant DNA

26
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
technology, purify particular bits
of HIV like the envelope

27
00:01:57 --> 00:02:01
glycoproteins,
GP120 or GP41, and inject those in

28
00:02:01 --> 00:02:06
the hopes that somebody makes an
antibody response against those.

29
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
One could use heterologous vaccines
like the old vaccinia smallpox

30
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
example.  Because,
in fact, there is a related virus to

31
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
HIV called SIV.
It infects monkeys so it's called

32
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
simian immunodeficiency virus.
It's quite similar.  And it's been

33
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
tried.  Again,
not so far successfully,

34
00:02:24 --> 00:02:28
but it's been tried as a potential
immunogen for HIV.

35
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
And finally recombinant vaccines.
To put HIV genes into some other

36
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
virus like vaccinia in the hopes
that, again, the virus will

37
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
replicate and make some HIV proteins
to which the body makes an immune

38
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
response which might be protective.
These have not worked.  And there

39
00:02:43 --> 00:02:47
are certain problems that have held
things up.  Firstly is safety.

40
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
There's a lot of worry out there
that if any of these strategies

41
00:02:51 --> 00:02:55
aren't fool-proof,
you might actually expose somebody

42
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
to a dangerous virus.
Let's say you think you're

43
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
attenuating HIV but you're really
not or you think you're killing HIV

44
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
but you're really not.
That might be very, very dangerous.

45
00:03:06 --> 00:03:10
So there is a lot of worry that
goes into these strategies.

46
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14
But more importantly is efficacy.
So far nothing has worked.  And the

47
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
reason we think it doesn't work is
the same reason that we've become

48
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
resistant to, rather become
sensitive to flu virus that we

49
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
reviewed last time.
HIV, like flu, changes very rapidly.

50
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
And there are a lot of HIV strains
out in the world.

51
00:03:30 --> 00:03:35
And so if you get vaccinated against
one, it might be protective against

52
00:03:35 --> 00:03:40
that one, but it's not going to be
protective against all the other

53
00:03:40 --> 00:03:45
ones.  So, so far nobody has come up
with something that will lead to

54
00:03:45 --> 00:03:50
resistance sort of across the board,
across many, many strains.  OK.  So

55
00:03:50 --> 00:03:55
the subject for today is prion
diseases.  This is a photograph of a

56
00:03:55 --> 00:04:00
cow being slaughtered because it
carries a disease called bovine

57
00:04:00 --> 00:04:05
spongiform encephalopathy
or Mad Cow Disease.

58
00:04:05 --> 00:04:09
And it's an example of a class of
diseases which are called Prion

59
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
Disease or transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies,

60
00:04:13 --> 00:04:17
clearly the longest and most
difficult to pronounce word we have

61
00:04:17 --> 00:04:42
used in this class.

62
00:04:42 --> 00:04:48
Transmissible,
it can be infectious,

63
00:04:48 --> 00:04:55
or they can be infectious.
Although, as you'll see, not all of

64
00:04:55 --> 00:05:01
this class of diseases is infectious.
Spongiform, because it causes

65
00:05:01 --> 00:05:07
sponge-like pathology.
And where does it cause the

66
00:05:07 --> 00:05:13
sponge-like pathology?
In the brain.  OK?  The amazing

67
00:05:13 --> 00:05:19
part of this story is the agent
which causes this disease.

68
00:05:19 --> 00:05:25
Everything else we've taught you
about in this course follows the

69
00:05:25 --> 00:05:31
standard central dogma
of molecule biology.

70
00:05:31 --> 00:05:37
The organisms has a genome which can
be made out of DNA or,

71
00:05:37 --> 00:05:44
as you saw in the context of some
viruses, RNA.  The genome then gives

72
00:05:44 --> 00:05:51
rise to RNA in the context of
transcription and protein.

73
00:05:51 --> 00:05:58
And the protein then assists in the
replication of the genome.  OK?

74
00:05:58 --> 00:06:10
Prions, which cause these diseases,
have no genome.  They have no genome.

75
00:06:10 --> 00:06:23
No RNA.  No DNA.  No nothing.

76
00:06:23 --> 00:06:30
They're protein only.  And
yet they replicate.

77
00:06:30 --> 00:06:36
This is an amazing story,
which is really rather new,

78
00:06:36 --> 00:06:42
largely ignored and treated with
some derision by the field,

79
00:06:42 --> 00:06:48
but now known to be true, at least
in many respects.

80
00:06:48 --> 00:06:54
And the diseases are not just of
cows.  The original disease or at

81
00:06:54 --> 00:07:00
least the first one that was studies
is a disease of sheep.

82
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
It's called Scrapie.
And I'll tell you a little bit more

83
00:07:04 --> 00:07:08
about it.  There's another disease
very similar of cows.

84
00:07:08 --> 00:07:12
Again, bovine spongiform
encephalopathy or BSE,

85
00:07:12 --> 00:07:17
commonly known as Mad Cow Disease.
The cows go a little crazy and die.

86
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
And then there's another disease,
actually a class of disease of

87
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
humans.  This one is called
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,

88
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
but it's not the only one.  And,
again, they have the same

89
00:07:29 --> 00:07:34
characteristics of sponge-like
morphology pathology in the brain.

90
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
So these are important diseases
agriculturally.

91
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
They're important diseases of
humans, although rather rare,

92
00:07:43 --> 00:07:48
but the biggest worry is it appears
that you can get Mad Cow Disease

93
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
from an infected sheep and you might
be able to get Creutzfeldt-Jakob

94
00:07:52 --> 00:07:57
Disease from an infected cow.
And you might remember a few years

95
00:07:57 --> 00:08:02
ago there was a slaughter.
And I just showed you one picture of

96
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
hundreds of thousands of cows in
Great Britain because there was an

97
00:08:06 --> 00:08:11
outbreak of Mad Cow Disease,
and there was an emergence of some

98
00:08:11 --> 00:08:16
patients who developed
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

99
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
The worry being that you could
transmit from the infected cow the

100
00:08:20 --> 00:08:25
development of this disease.
OK.  This just shows you some

101
00:08:25 --> 00:08:30
pathology.
Again, one similarity between the

102
00:08:30 --> 00:08:35
diseases of sheep,
cows, humans, and here's another

103
00:08:35 --> 00:08:39
human disease,
is this sort of sponge-like change

104
00:08:39 --> 00:08:44
in the context of the brain.
These vacuoles which are caused by

105
00:08:44 --> 00:08:49
the death of cells.
And, obviously, if you have dying

106
00:08:49 --> 00:08:54
cells in your brain that going to
lead to motor defects,

107
00:08:54 --> 00:08:59
as well as cognitive defects,
both of which occur in this disease.

108
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
You might also notice,
especially here and here,

109
00:09:03 --> 00:09:10
there are buildups of plaques.

110
00:09:10 --> 00:09:19
These are protein aggregates.

111
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
And we actually think it's the
buildup of those protein aggregates

112
00:09:22 --> 00:09:26
that kills the cells.
And they turn out to be important

113
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
in the story.  OK.
So let me tell you a little bit

114
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
about the history of this,
which is itself fascinating.

115
00:09:32 --> 00:09:48
So, as I said,

116
00:09:48 --> 00:09:53
the first disease that was studied
was Scrapie.  And it was observed in

117
00:09:53 --> 00:09:59
around 1900.  The animals had this
phenotype of scraping their skin and

118
00:09:59 --> 00:10:04
in scraping off their fur.
That's why it's called Scrapie.

119
00:10:04 --> 00:10:09
But in general they also had
reduced coordination.

120
00:10:09 --> 00:10:14
And it was eventually fatal.
And importantly it seemed to occur

121
00:10:14 --> 00:10:23
in herds.

122
00:10:23 --> 00:10:28
So something in the environment of
the herd, perhaps the agent that was

123
00:10:28 --> 00:10:33
responsible was transmitting the
disease from one effected

124
00:10:33 --> 00:10:37
sheep to another.
And it had, as I showed you up there,

125
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
characteristic morphology
in the brain.

126
00:10:41 --> 00:10:50
So this was studied.

127
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
And it was considered to be an
important disease in the farming

128
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
community, especially in Europe,
most particularly in the United

129
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
Kingdom.  But it wasn't
largely known.

130
00:11:00 --> 00:11:07
More or less confined to that
community.  Until some investigators

131
00:11:07 --> 00:11:14
began studying a disease of humans
called Kuru.  This was a disease of

132
00:11:14 --> 00:11:22
a particular tribe of peoples called
the Four Highlanders in

133
00:11:22 --> 00:11:38
Popua, New Guinea.

134
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
These individuals developed a
disease which was rather similar to

135
00:11:42 --> 00:11:51
Scrapie.  Reduced coordination.

136
00:11:51 --> 00:11:55
They also developed dementia,
which may well have happened in the

137
00:11:55 --> 00:12:00
sheep but you wouldn't have known it.
It was also fatal.

138
00:12:00 --> 00:12:05
And it had the very same brain
pathology.  And it also seemed to be

139
00:12:05 --> 00:12:11
transmissible because it occurred
within tribes.

140
00:12:11 --> 00:12:17
So investigators now started to
study this disease.

141
00:12:17 --> 00:12:23
And they discovered,
in fact, that the individuals who

142
00:12:23 --> 00:12:29
developed this disease
had engaged in --

143
00:12:29 --> 00:12:39
-- ritualistic cannibalism.

144
00:12:39 --> 00:12:44
Individuals who died of this
disease were prepared for burial.

145
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48
And, in the process of preparing
the body for burial,

146
00:12:48 --> 00:12:53
parts of the body was eaten.
That was the way they celebrated

147
00:12:53 --> 00:12:58
the death of people in this tribe.
And they were able to link the

148
00:12:58 --> 00:13:02
ingestion, specifically of brains of
infected or affected individuals,

149
00:13:02 --> 00:13:06
with the subsequent development of
this disease.  And that suggested

150
00:13:06 --> 00:13:10
that there was an agent that was
being passed from the affected

151
00:13:10 --> 00:13:15
individual to the individual who
became affected,

152
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
suggesting again that there was some
sort of agent responsible.

153
00:13:19 --> 00:13:23
When the etiology of this disease
was figured out,

154
00:13:23 --> 00:13:28
the tribe was informed and the
process was stopped.

155
00:13:28 --> 00:13:33
So in the late 1950s there was no
more ritualistic cannibalism and

156
00:13:33 --> 00:13:38
indeed the disease went away,
but it continued to be studied by

157
00:13:38 --> 00:13:44
investigators.
And in 1966 they succeeded in

158
00:13:44 --> 00:13:49
transmitting it to an animal species,
to monkeys.  It took a long time,

159
00:13:49 --> 00:13:55
several years for the monkeys to
exhibit the symptoms

160
00:13:55 --> 00:14:00
of the disease.
And it was then attributed to what

161
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
was called a slow virus.
It was known to be very small

162
00:14:04 --> 00:14:08
because you could filter the
material before injecting it into

163
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12
the animal.  So it was smaller than
a cell and it was assumed to be a

164
00:14:12 --> 00:14:16
virus.  And, actually,
the investigators who made that

165
00:14:16 --> 00:14:20
discovery went on to win the Nobel
Prize for their “discovery of the

166
00:14:20 --> 00:14:24
slow virus” responsible for this and
possibly related diseases.

167
00:14:24 --> 00:14:38
Well, that was all well and good,

168
00:14:38 --> 00:14:42
but it was very difficult to study
this disease using this experimental

169
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
system.  It took a long time.
It's not easy to do experiments in

170
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
monkeys and so on.
And so it was necessary to find new

171
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
experimental systems.
And this was pioneered by an

172
00:14:54 --> 00:14:58
investigator at the University of
California, San Francisco by the

173
00:14:58 --> 00:15:03
name of Stan Prusiner.
And his goal was to develop an assay

174
00:15:03 --> 00:15:10
for the agent that caused Scrapie.
He called it the Scrapie agent.

175
00:15:10 --> 00:15:16
And he probably started by assuming
that this was some sort of virus,

176
00:15:16 --> 00:15:23
one of these slow viruses, which has
not been seen by anybody before but

177
00:15:23 --> 00:15:30
just been inferred to exist.
And so what he did was to see

178
00:15:30 --> 00:15:36
whether he could transfer the agent
from a sheep by taking an extract of

179
00:15:36 --> 00:15:43
the brain of an infected sheep and
injecting it into the

180
00:15:43 --> 00:15:48
brain of a hamster.
And sure enough that led,

181
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
in time, to disease.  And the
disease manifestations looked very

182
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
much like Scrapie itself.
So now he had an experimental

183
00:15:56 --> 00:16:01
system.
And the time it took to get the

184
00:16:01 --> 00:16:07
disease in the hamsters was
relatively short,

185
00:16:07 --> 00:16:13
just a couple of years as opposed to
maybe ten years in the case of the

186
00:16:13 --> 00:16:19
monkeys.  He went further and he
took a brain extract from the

187
00:16:19 --> 00:16:25
infected hamsters and he injected it
into mice.  And they,

188
00:16:25 --> 00:16:31
too, eventually developed disease.
And importantly,

189
00:16:31 --> 00:16:37
over the course of this protocol,
the time to disease development --

190
00:16:37 --> 00:16:46
-- reduced each time.

191
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
It took less and less time for the
disease to be seen.

192
00:16:49 --> 00:16:53
And so by this point you could do
assays in a couple of months.

193
00:16:53 --> 00:17:03
And that's illustrated here.

194
00:17:03 --> 00:17:07
So, again, Prusiner took the brains
of infected sheep,

195
00:17:07 --> 00:17:12
transferred them to the hamsters
initially.  It took him one to two

196
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
years to develop the brain pathology.
And then he took extracts from them,

197
00:17:16 --> 00:17:21
transferred them to mice,
and now it was only six months to

198
00:17:21 --> 00:17:25
develop the same sort of lesions.
In doing this he was also able to

199
00:17:25 --> 00:17:30
demonstrate that whatever the agent
was, whatever it was,

200
00:17:30 --> 00:17:35
in this assay system it could
replicate.

201
00:17:35 --> 00:17:39
So how did he know that?
Well, he took --

202
00:17:39 --> 00:17:49
-- a certain amount of diseased

203
00:17:49 --> 00:17:54
brain extract,
certain number of milligrams of

204
00:17:54 --> 00:18:00
diseased brain extract,
and he extracted from it a certain

205
00:18:00 --> 00:18:05
infectious dose.
And that amount was enough to cause

206
00:18:05 --> 00:18:10
disease in the injected animal.
If you used less than that it

207
00:18:10 --> 00:18:15
wouldn't cause disease.
If he used more than that,

208
00:18:15 --> 00:18:20
that was more than enough.  So he
injected it into the brain of a

209
00:18:20 --> 00:18:25
mouse, he waited six months.
He then extracted the diseased

210
00:18:25 --> 00:18:30
brain, and asked how much
material was there?

211
00:18:30 --> 00:18:35
And the answer was at least a
thousand-fold the initial infectious

212
00:18:35 --> 00:18:41
dose.  So the only way that could
happen is if “the stuff' that was

213
00:18:41 --> 00:18:47
responsible for this,
in this time period, was able to

214
00:18:47 --> 00:18:53
replicate.  You had more at the end
than you had at the beginning,

215
00:18:53 --> 00:18:59
so it was able to produce more of
itself.

216
00:18:59 --> 00:19:03
Again, this thinking was that it was
probably some sort of virus,

217
00:19:03 --> 00:19:07
the virus was replicating inside the
brains of these animals,

218
00:19:07 --> 00:19:11
and at the end of the disease
process there was a heck of a lot

219
00:19:11 --> 00:19:15
more virus than when you started.
Not a big surprise in that respect.

220
00:19:15 --> 00:19:19
Well, he then used this to try to
purify further the agent that was

221
00:19:19 --> 00:19:23
responsible to get at this virus,
if that's what it was.  So he used

222
00:19:23 --> 00:19:27
this assay.  He took fractions of
diseased brain and split them up in

223
00:19:27 --> 00:19:31
different ways using different
protocols for purification in order

224
00:19:31 --> 00:19:35
to find the thing that
was responsible.

225
00:19:35 --> 00:19:41
So he took, for example,
an un-pure diseased brain.

226
00:19:41 --> 00:19:47
And he ran that out on a protein
gel.  Now, of course,

227
00:19:47 --> 00:19:53
in a brain you're going to have lots
and lots of proteins.

228
00:19:53 --> 00:20:00
Some will be more abundant than
others, but there will be lots.

229
00:20:00 --> 00:20:04
In fact, there will be a big smear
of proteins here.

230
00:20:04 --> 00:20:09
You really won't be able to see a
pattern.  If you took that stuff and

231
00:20:09 --> 00:20:13
purified it somewhat,
and he knew that this fraction,

232
00:20:13 --> 00:20:18
this partially purified fraction
carried this Scrapie agent because

233
00:20:18 --> 00:20:22
if he transferred into a mouse,
that mouse developed disease.  And

234
00:20:22 --> 00:20:27
then he looked at the protein
composition of that.

235
00:20:27 --> 00:20:32
Now some of the bands went away and
some of them stayed.

236
00:20:32 --> 00:20:40
And then he took that stuff and he
purified it still further.

237
00:20:40 --> 00:20:48
And now he could see only one band,
one protein band.  He took that out

238
00:20:48 --> 00:20:56
and it was found to be infectious.
It would appear that the protein

239
00:20:56 --> 00:21:02
was enough to cause infection.
Now, the skeptics said that's

240
00:21:02 --> 00:21:06
ridiculous.  Maybe the protein
co-purifies with the thing that

241
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10
causes infection,
but there has got to be a virus in

242
00:21:10 --> 00:21:14
there or a bacterium.
There has got to be something in

243
00:21:14 --> 00:21:18
there, not just a protein.
Proteins cannot replicate

244
00:21:18 --> 00:21:22
themselves.  But Prusiner persevered.
He purified this to the point where

245
00:21:22 --> 00:21:32
he could sequence it.

246
00:21:32 --> 00:21:36
And, much to his surprise,
when he purified that protein --

247
00:21:36 --> 00:21:48
-- he found that it was derived from

248
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
the mouse genome.
The protein, which he now believed

249
00:21:52 --> 00:21:57
was responsible for the development
of the disease,

250
00:21:57 --> 00:22:01
was encoded by the host organism,
not by some as yet uncharacterized

251
00:22:01 --> 00:22:05
infectious agent.
So that was an important

252
00:22:05 --> 00:22:08
breakthrough.  There were still lots
of skeptics who said again maybe so,

253
00:22:08 --> 00:22:12
maybe it's there, maybe it's coming
from the mouse,

254
00:22:12 --> 00:22:15
but there is something else going on
here.  And I have to tell you that

255
00:22:15 --> 00:22:18
right around this time I took a
class from Stan Prusiner.

256
00:22:18 --> 00:22:22
He was at UCSF.  I was a graduate
student at UCSF.

257
00:22:22 --> 00:22:25
And he presented us with his
findings right around this same time.

258
00:22:25 --> 00:22:29
And we basically laughed at him.
We literally did.  We mocked him.

259
00:22:29 --> 00:22:34
We thought it was a joke that you
could suggest that some protein was

260
00:22:34 --> 00:22:40
causing the disease.
And moreover it was replicating.

261
00:22:40 --> 00:22:45
It seemed ridiculous to us.  Again,
he ignored us. A good idea.  And he

262
00:22:45 --> 00:22:51
asked all right,
is this agent which I can purify so

263
00:22:51 --> 00:22:57
well, does it carry a nucleic acid?
One way to do that is to expose the

264
00:22:57 --> 00:23:02
agent to radiation.
Radiation damages DNA and RNA.

265
00:23:02 --> 00:23:07
If this organisms, or whatever the
hell it is, has a DNA or RNA genome

266
00:23:07 --> 00:23:13
it should be affected.
Bacteria are affected when you

267
00:23:13 --> 00:23:18
expose them to UV.
Bacterial viruses are affected.

268
00:23:18 --> 00:23:23
Genes in your cells get mutated.
The Scrapie agents laughs, doesn't

269
00:23:23 --> 00:23:29
care.  You can radiate it till the
cows come home.  It doesn't matter.

270
00:23:29 --> 00:23:33
Again, suggestive that it
didn't have a genome.

271
00:23:33 --> 00:23:40
So he's got a protein that he thinks

272
00:23:40 --> 00:23:44
is causing disease but he has no
idea how.  He then did another

273
00:23:44 --> 00:23:49
important experiment.
He found that the

274
00:23:49 --> 00:23:53
Scrapie-associated form of this
protein was actually different

275
00:23:53 --> 00:23:57
somehow from the normal form of the
protein made in the cells

276
00:23:57 --> 00:24:02
of the organism.
And he found that by looking at the

277
00:24:02 --> 00:24:06
resistance of the protein to
protease.  So he purified the

278
00:24:06 --> 00:24:10
protein now not just from
Scrapie-infected brains but also

279
00:24:10 --> 00:24:15
from normal brains.
So we have the normal version of

280
00:24:15 --> 00:24:19
the protein and the Scrapie version
of the protein.

281
00:24:19 --> 00:24:24
He called these proteins PrP for
prion precursor.

282
00:24:24 --> 00:24:28
We'll come to the definition of
prion in a moment.

283
00:24:28 --> 00:24:33
And they could either be normal or
Scrapie associated.

284
00:24:33 --> 00:24:38
And the Scrapie associated he gave
the abbreviation PrPSc.

285
00:24:38 --> 00:24:43
And, as I said, he exposed these to
different conditions looking for a

286
00:24:43 --> 00:24:49
difference, and particularly
exposing to proteases.

287
00:24:49 --> 00:24:54
If he takes the purified protein
and runs it out on a protein gel,

288
00:24:54 --> 00:25:00
in the absence of protease he sees
the band.

289
00:25:00 --> 00:25:04
OK?  Like we saw over there or up
there.  In the presence of protease,

290
00:25:04 --> 00:25:09
the cellular version of the protein
is sensitive so there is no band.

291
00:25:09 --> 00:25:14
It gets digested by the protease.
The Scrapie associated version of

292
00:25:14 --> 00:25:19
the protein in the absence of
protease is there,

293
00:25:19 --> 00:25:24
but in the presence of the protease
is still there.

294
00:25:24 --> 00:25:29
So the Scrapie associated form is
protease resistant.

295
00:25:29 --> 00:25:33
It is somehow different from the
normal.  And maybe it was that

296
00:25:33 --> 00:25:38
difference, whatever it was,
that caused it to be disease-causing.

297
00:25:38 --> 00:25:43
So based on this collection of
evidence and a little bit more,

298
00:25:43 --> 00:25:48
Prusiner set out the Prion
Hypothesis that Scrapie,

299
00:25:48 --> 00:25:52
as well as other TSE, transmissible
spongiform encephalopathies,

300
00:25:52 --> 00:25:57
are caused by a protein-only
infectious agent, which

301
00:25:57 --> 00:26:02
he renamed prion.
The disease causing protein is an

302
00:26:02 --> 00:26:07
altered form a cellular protein
which can cause the cellular protein

303
00:26:07 --> 00:26:12
to adopt the altered conformation,
and in this way the prion can

304
00:26:12 --> 00:26:17
replicate.  He could explain the
production of more of this stuff by

305
00:26:17 --> 00:26:22
suggesting that the interaction of
the altered form with the normal

306
00:26:22 --> 00:26:27
form could turn the normal form in
the altered form.

307
00:26:27 --> 00:26:32
And, as I've told you,
he called the normal protein PrP and

308
00:26:32 --> 00:26:37
the Scrapie associated PrPSc.
So his hypothesis was that there is

309
00:26:37 --> 00:26:43
a normal cellular protein which has
a conformation.

310
00:26:43 --> 00:26:48
And this is PrP.
And there was some evidence,

311
00:26:48 --> 00:26:54
based on analysis of the structure,
although not 3-dimensional structure

312
00:26:54 --> 00:27:00
of this protein,
that it was largely alpha-helical.

313
00:27:00 --> 00:27:07
And it was protease sensitive,
as I said.  And if you ever need to

314
00:27:07 --> 00:27:15
remember which form is which,
another mnemonic, it's alpha-helical,

315
00:27:15 --> 00:27:22
remember helix=happy.
He suggested that this form could

316
00:27:22 --> 00:27:30
convert, it could change it
conformation to a form that was

317
00:27:30 --> 00:27:38
associated with Scrapie.
It had a different structure.

318
00:27:38 --> 00:27:46
It was more of a beta pleated sheet.
It was protease resistant.

319
00:27:46 --> 00:27:54
And, again, if you want to remember
the beta pleated sheet is bad.

320
00:27:54 --> 00:28:01
OK?  So there were two forms.
But more importantly than that he

321
00:28:01 --> 00:28:06
suggested that if you have this form
it can convert this form

322
00:28:06 --> 00:28:23
into this form.

323
00:28:23 --> 00:28:30
So the model was that if you have in
the same cell,

324
00:28:30 --> 00:28:37
PrP in the Scrapie form,
plus normal PrP, the normal gets

325
00:28:37 --> 00:28:44
converted to Scrapie.  And
diagrammatically --

326
00:28:44 --> 00:28:54
-- perhaps through some sort of

327
00:28:54 --> 00:29:00
intermediate in which the two
proteins interact,

328
00:29:00 --> 00:29:06
the abnormal form can change the
conformation of the normal form

329
00:29:06 --> 00:29:12
giving rise to two abnormal forms.
And if this continues and continues

330
00:29:12 --> 00:29:16
and continues in an infected brain,
you're going to have a buildup of

331
00:29:16 --> 00:29:20
this abnormal form which maybe
aggregates and maybe causes the

332
00:29:20 --> 00:29:25
brain's cells to die.
This is a little more detail.

333
00:29:25 --> 00:29:29
Again, this is a theoretical
3-dimensional structure of the

334
00:29:29 --> 00:29:34
cellular form, the normal
form of PrP.

335
00:29:34 --> 00:29:38
See the alpha-helical structure?
And this is the proposed beta

336
00:29:38 --> 00:29:43
pleated sheet structure of the PrP
Scrapie form.  Note,

337
00:29:43 --> 00:29:48
the beta pleated sheets.
And the idea was that the abnormal

338
00:29:48 --> 00:29:52
form, shown in blue,
could interact with the normal form,

339
00:29:52 --> 00:29:57
shown in red, and convert the normal
to the abnormal.

340
00:29:57 --> 00:30:02
And in so doing perhaps created
these aggregates which built up in

341
00:30:02 --> 00:30:07
the brain's brain cells and
caused them to die.

342
00:30:07 --> 00:30:11
So that seems reasonable.
And, as I said, a great deal of

343
00:30:11 --> 00:30:16
evidence went on to support it.
There was one additional definitive

344
00:30:16 --> 00:30:21
experiment about the nature of the
agent which comes a little bit later

345
00:30:21 --> 00:30:26
in the story.  And it was really
after that, that Prusiner went on to

346
00:30:26 --> 00:30:37
win the Nobel Prize.

347
00:30:37 --> 00:30:42
So, as I said,
there are several human diseases.

348
00:30:42 --> 00:30:47
This is not just a disease of sheep.
There are several human diseases

349
00:30:47 --> 00:30:52
that look similar,
and we now believe are all caused by

350
00:30:52 --> 00:30:58
this exact same mechanism.
There's Kuru which is infectious.

351
00:30:58 --> 00:31:02
If you eat the brain of somebody
with Kuru you will get Kuru,

352
00:31:02 --> 00:31:07
which is not a good thing to get.
It actually stands for, I believe,

353
00:31:07 --> 00:31:11
this name means “laughing death”.
These individuals become demented

354
00:31:11 --> 00:31:16
and then die.  So Kuru
is infectious.

355
00:31:16 --> 00:31:33
The one that's been in the news more

356
00:31:33 --> 00:31:37
recently is Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease.  And this can be caused by

357
00:31:37 --> 00:31:42
different mechanisms.
You can get it through iatrogenic

358
00:31:42 --> 00:31:46
exposure.  Does anybody have any
idea what iatrogenic means?

359
00:31:46 --> 00:31:51
This is one of my favorite words in
medical terminology.

360
00:31:51 --> 00:31:55
It means a disease you get in the
hospital.  OK?

361
00:31:55 --> 00:32:00
You go in with one problem,
you come out with a worse problem.

362
00:32:00 --> 00:32:04
OK?  Iatrogenic.
And specifically the way that some

363
00:32:04 --> 00:32:09
of these patients,
and it's a very, very small number,

364
00:32:09 --> 00:32:14
I assure you, developed
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease is they

365
00:32:14 --> 00:32:19
went in for an electroencephalogram
where they put a brain probe into

366
00:32:19 --> 00:32:24
your head.  Unfortunately,
take, can I help you?  Hello?

367
00:32:24 --> 00:32:29
Someone's watching me.  [LAUGHTER]
Not a good topic to have someone

368
00:32:29 --> 00:32:34
watching you teach.
Brain probe in the head.

369
00:32:34 --> 00:32:38
OK?  Several years later the person
develops Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

370
00:32:38 --> 00:32:42
Go back, as who used that brain
probe last?  Turns out it was

371
00:32:42 --> 00:32:47
somebody with Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease.  The brain probes are

372
00:32:47 --> 00:32:51
stored in formalin,
a fixative, it doesn't kill the

373
00:32:51 --> 00:32:55
agent.  It's remarkably resistant to
almost anything you could do to it.

374
00:32:55 --> 00:33:00
And so these patients, regrettably,
got exposed to that thing.

375
00:33:00 --> 00:33:04
Another way is through corneal
transplants.  Every once in a while

376
00:33:04 --> 00:33:08
somebody with a corneal transplant
develops Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease

377
00:33:08 --> 00:33:12
because the cornea came from
somebody who had or went on to

378
00:33:12 --> 00:33:17
develop Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
There are also sporadic forms.  So

379
00:33:17 --> 00:33:21
sometimes people just get
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease as though

380
00:33:21 --> 00:33:25
spontaneously.
Their normal PrP protein flips to

381
00:33:25 --> 00:33:30
the Scrapie form.
And once that happens it's catalytic,

382
00:33:30 --> 00:33:35
it keeps happening.
And then, interestingly enough,

383
00:33:35 --> 00:33:40
there are familial forms, familial
forms of CJD.  It runs in some

384
00:33:40 --> 00:33:45
families.  They're not very common
but there are some.

385
00:33:45 --> 00:33:50
And there are two other diseases,
which I'm not going to write out

386
00:33:50 --> 00:33:55
because you don't need to know their
names, but one of them is called GSS

387
00:33:55 --> 00:34:00
and it's also familial.
And another is called FFH.

388
00:34:00 --> 00:34:05
FF, sorry, FFI.
And it's also familial.

389
00:34:05 --> 00:34:10
This is a funny one. Not funny if
you have it, but the FFH stands for

390
00:34:10 --> 00:34:15
fatal familial insomnia.
Now, I've had insomnia sometimes I

391
00:34:15 --> 00:34:21
feel like dying at the end of it,
but these patients actually do.

392
00:34:21 --> 00:34:26
This is a degenerative disease
associated somehow with insomnia,

393
00:34:26 --> 00:34:31
and it's ultimately fatal.
GSS has some similarities with

394
00:34:31 --> 00:34:35
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease but it's a
little bit different.

395
00:34:35 --> 00:34:40
And so all three of these diseases
have similarities,

396
00:34:40 --> 00:34:44
but they also have their own unique
features.  And interestingly they

397
00:34:44 --> 00:34:48
all have a common cause.
All of the familial forms of these

398
00:34:48 --> 00:34:53
diseases have a common cause.
Can anybody tell me what it is?

399
00:34:53 --> 00:34:57
Why might you get this disease?
Something in your genome,

400
00:34:57 --> 00:35:14
why might you get it?

401
00:35:14 --> 00:35:18
They carry mutations in the PrP gene.
So if you sequence the genome of

402
00:35:18 --> 00:35:22
these patients,
you find that they carry a PrP gene

403
00:35:22 --> 00:35:26
which is different from the normal
one.  And the different diseases

404
00:35:26 --> 00:35:30
carry different mutations
in the PrP gene.

405
00:35:30 --> 00:35:33
Some of them cause this
manifestation.

406
00:35:33 --> 00:35:37
Other mutations cause this
manifestation.

407
00:35:37 --> 00:35:41
And still other mutations cause
this manifestation.

408
00:35:41 --> 00:35:45
But it's all more or less the same.
PrP protein is flipping and causing

409
00:35:45 --> 00:35:49
other like proteins around it,
other versions, normal versions to

410
00:35:49 --> 00:35:53
flip, too.  The fact that there are
differences is intriguing and a

411
00:35:53 --> 00:35:57
little bit hard to explain.
I don't think there is a

412
00:35:57 --> 00:36:01
satisfactory explanation for how
different mutations in the same gene

413
00:36:01 --> 00:36:05
cause apparently different
conformations.

414
00:36:05 --> 00:36:10
And those different conformations
can be propagated faithfully upon

415
00:36:10 --> 00:36:15
interaction with the normal protein.
So here's a diagram of that.

416
00:36:15 --> 00:36:21
Here's the point mutant,
let's say it's CJD.  And here's a

417
00:36:21 --> 00:36:26
point mutant FFI.
It's not the same point mutation.

418
00:36:26 --> 00:36:32
This one folds in its abnormal
conformation into this structure.

419
00:36:32 --> 00:36:36
This one folds in a slightly
different structure.

420
00:36:36 --> 00:36:40
And maybe this can propagate its
structure, and it can propagate its

421
00:36:40 --> 00:36:44
own structure on interaction with
the normal protein.

422
00:36:44 --> 00:36:48
And those different structures may
be aggregated different subsets of

423
00:36:48 --> 00:36:52
cells or the different cells are
sensitive in some ways to these

424
00:36:52 --> 00:36:56
different structures.
So some die in one disease,

425
00:36:56 --> 00:37:00
others die in a different disease,
and that's what causes the different

426
00:37:00 --> 00:37:04
manifestations.
And so I've given you examples now

427
00:37:04 --> 00:37:09
of these diseases which are caused
by the same general mechanism,

428
00:37:09 --> 00:37:14
although with slightly different
etiologies.  In the case of Kuru,

429
00:37:14 --> 00:37:20
you can ingest an abnormal copy of
the protein.  It makes its way to

430
00:37:20 --> 00:37:25
the brain, interacts with normal
protein and converts

431
00:37:25 --> 00:37:30
it to abnormal.
There are probably examples of

432
00:37:30 --> 00:37:34
spontaneous or sporadic conversion
of normal protein to abnormal

433
00:37:34 --> 00:37:38
protein.  Again,
a process that gets propagated.

434
00:37:38 --> 00:37:42
Or you can carry a mutation which
will increase the likelihood that

435
00:37:42 --> 00:37:46
this conversion takes place.
And when it does it gets propagated

436
00:37:46 --> 00:37:50
inside of you.
And maybe sometimes people pick up

437
00:37:50 --> 00:37:54
sporadically a mutation in their PrP
gene which causes those cells again

438
00:37:54 --> 00:37:59
to flip this conformation
more rapidly.

439
00:37:59 --> 00:38:03
So lots of different mechanisms but
the same basic idea,

440
00:38:03 --> 00:38:07
PrP becoming abnormal and causing
cells around it,

441
00:38:07 --> 00:38:12
or rather proteins around it to
become abnormal,

442
00:38:12 --> 00:38:16
too.  Why has this caused increased
attention recently?

443
00:38:16 --> 00:38:20
Because of the outbreak of this
related disease bovine spongiform

444
00:38:20 --> 00:38:25
encephalopathy or BSE.
This is a story from about five

445
00:38:25 --> 00:38:29
years ago.  It was just after the
height of the fear of the increase

446
00:38:29 --> 00:38:34
in the incidence of this disease in
Great Britain.

447
00:38:34 --> 00:38:37
Some of the cows in Great Britain
had made their way to other

448
00:38:37 --> 00:38:41
countries and,
therefore, were slaughtered.

449
00:38:41 --> 00:38:44
And throughout Great Britain cows
were slaughtered in remarkable

450
00:38:44 --> 00:38:48
numbers to try to limit the scope of
this disease.  Why were people so

451
00:38:48 --> 00:38:51
worried about the outbreak of a
disease in cows?

452
00:38:51 --> 00:38:55
Because it turned out,
and this just shows you the outbreak.

453
00:38:55 --> 00:38:59
This is the number of BSE cases in
this timeframe.

454
00:38:59 --> 00:39:04
And you can see the number of
affected cows dramatically increased.

455
00:39:04 --> 00:39:09
The reason that they dramatically
increased is that the cows were

456
00:39:09 --> 00:39:14
being fed parts of infected sheep.
The sheep had the disease, or some

457
00:39:14 --> 00:39:19
of them, and they passed it onto the
cows.  And then the cows developed

458
00:39:19 --> 00:39:24
the disease.  When they noticed this
practice, they started prohibiting

459
00:39:24 --> 00:39:29
the use of other animal products in
the feeding of these cows.

460
00:39:29 --> 00:39:33
And so eventually the incidence
dropped.  And these are various

461
00:39:33 --> 00:39:37
safeguards that were put into place
at different times to limit what the

462
00:39:37 --> 00:39:41
cows actually got exposed to.
And nowadays there are very strict

463
00:39:41 --> 00:39:46
practices about what you can feed
your cows and your sheep to try

464
00:39:46 --> 00:39:50
prevent the spread of this disease.
And it's not just a spread of the

465
00:39:50 --> 00:39:54
disease in cows,
but here in this pink line tracking

466
00:39:54 --> 00:39:58
with the incidence of BSE that was
going up around this same time

467
00:39:58 --> 00:40:03
period was the incidence
of CJD in the pink.

468
00:40:03 --> 00:40:07
And indeed it was documented that
these individuals developed this

469
00:40:07 --> 00:40:11
disease because of prior exposure to
infected meat.

470
00:40:11 --> 00:40:15
So you can get this disease through
exposure to an animal that carries

471
00:40:15 --> 00:40:20
this disease.  However,
I need to tell you it's still rather

472
00:40:20 --> 00:40:24
rare.  It doesn't happen very often
so you don't need to panic.

473
00:40:24 --> 00:40:28
In fact, there was great fear that
this would skyrocket after 2000

474
00:40:28 --> 00:40:32
because it was feared that there was
some incubation period taking place

475
00:40:32 --> 00:40:37
and maybe lots more people would
develop the disease.

476
00:40:37 --> 00:40:42
That turned out not to be true.
If you look at the peak in 2000,

477
00:40:42 --> 00:40:47
it actually drops back down again.
So the epidemic of CJD that was

478
00:40:47 --> 00:40:52
feared actually didn't materialize.
Still, there are great fears that

479
00:40:52 --> 00:40:58
any exposure could give you some
risk of developing this disease.

480
00:40:58 --> 00:41:02
And you may remember just earlier
this year, a big scar in this

481
00:41:02 --> 00:41:07
country because two cows in Canada
were found to have BSE,

482
00:41:07 --> 00:41:11
and maybe that cow meat had made its
way into our food supply.

483
00:41:11 --> 00:41:16
So, again, there's tremendous worry
out there.  But it's important for

484
00:41:16 --> 00:41:20
you to know that the incidence,
even for people known to be infected,

485
00:41:20 --> 00:41:25
is very, very small.
And because it often comes up,

486
00:41:25 --> 00:41:29
how do you go from ingesting
something to get a disease

487
00:41:29 --> 00:41:34
in the brain?
We now think that the cells in the

488
00:41:34 --> 00:41:38
gut, and probably dendritic cells,
cells of the immune system pick up

489
00:41:38 --> 00:41:43
the Scrapie protein and transfer it
up to the brain.

490
00:41:43 --> 00:41:48
And once there somehow it gets into
the neurons and then spreads from

491
00:41:48 --> 00:41:52
neuron to neuron,
thereby causing the disease in the

492
00:41:52 --> 00:41:57
brain.  OK.
The last thing I want to tell you in

493
00:41:57 --> 00:42:02
the last five minutes is that there
seems to be some form of species

494
00:42:02 --> 00:42:07
barrier.  So if you get some human
Scrapie protein,

495
00:42:07 --> 00:42:12
PrP Scrapie, the likelihood that
you're going to get disease is

496
00:42:12 --> 00:42:17
pretty high because that protein
interacts well with your PrP protein.

497
00:42:17 --> 00:42:22
But if you get a PrP Scrapie
protein from a different species,

498
00:42:22 --> 00:42:27
it doesn't interact so well with
yours.  And this is called

499
00:42:27 --> 00:42:32
a species barrier.
And you can see it's shown here.

500
00:42:32 --> 00:42:36
If you take a hamster with an
infected brain and give it to a

501
00:42:36 --> 00:42:40
mouse, it takes six months for that
mouse to develop the disease.

502
00:42:40 --> 00:42:44
OK?  It takes a while for the
hamster PrP Scrapie to interact

503
00:42:44 --> 00:42:49
sufficiently with the mouse protein,
which is present in the mouse's

504
00:42:49 --> 00:42:53
cells, to give you disease.
But if you now take this

505
00:42:53 --> 00:42:57
preparation which is PrP Scrapie
from mouse, because it's the mouse

506
00:42:57 --> 00:43:01
protein that's been converted here,
and inject it into mouse, now it

507
00:43:01 --> 00:43:06
happens much, much faster.
So there's a species barrier.

508
00:43:06 --> 00:43:10
And once it's been passed through
one species, you overcome that

509
00:43:10 --> 00:43:14
barrier.  Now,
how could you test this notion that

510
00:43:14 --> 00:43:19
there's a species-specific
difference.  Well,

511
00:43:19 --> 00:43:23
the way it was done by Prusiner and
others is to introduce a hamster

512
00:43:23 --> 00:43:27
gene into this mouse here.
So this mouse now makes not just

513
00:43:27 --> 00:43:32
mouse PrP but also hamster PrP.
And what would be the expectation

514
00:43:32 --> 00:43:36
for that experiment?
If you now take this transgenic

515
00:43:36 --> 00:43:40
mouse that carries a hamster PrP
gene and introduce the Scrapie agent

516
00:43:40 --> 00:43:44
from hamster, what would happen?
It would happen faster because now

517
00:43:44 --> 00:43:48
you could template off of the
hamster protein,

518
00:43:48 --> 00:43:52
and sure enough this animal develops
disease faster.

519
00:43:52 --> 00:43:56
And when you purify the PrP Scrapie
from that infected brain,

520
00:43:56 --> 00:44:00
it's composed of both mouse and
hamster.

521
00:44:00 --> 00:44:05
OK?  Now, what would happen if you
made a mouse that didn't have a PrP

522
00:44:05 --> 00:44:10
gene?  You knocked it out.
A, you might be surprised if that

523
00:44:10 --> 00:44:15
mouse lived because you might think
that the PrP gene is important for

524
00:44:15 --> 00:44:20
something.  Well,
it turns out you can make a mouse

525
00:44:20 --> 00:44:25
that lacks PrP all together.
You can delete the PrP gene.

526
00:44:25 --> 00:44:30
So let's say you had a PrP
deficient mouse and you introduced

527
00:44:30 --> 00:44:36
the Scrapie agent into it,
what would happen?

528
00:44:36 --> 00:44:40
Well, you need a PrP protein to be
converted in order to develop the

529
00:44:40 --> 00:44:44
disease.  If you don't have the gene,
you don't have the protein,

530
00:44:44 --> 00:44:49
so it cannot be converted.  And sure
enough that's the case.

531
00:44:49 --> 00:44:53
If you do this experiment,
you propagate some PrP in a mouse

532
00:44:53 --> 00:44:57
and then transfer it into a mouse
that's lacking PrP altogether,

533
00:44:57 --> 00:45:02
the animal is disease-free.
And this was the experiment that

534
00:45:02 --> 00:45:06
really sealed the deal and led to
the Nobel Prize for Prusiner.

535
00:45:06 --> 00:45:11
At this point nobody could really
argue that it was the cellular

536
00:45:11 --> 00:45:15
protein being converted in the
absence of any genome that was

537
00:45:15 --> 00:45:20
responsible.  So the problem doesn't
go away.  Here's another species

538
00:45:20 --> 00:45:25
which has been observed to have
another one of these diseases.

539
00:45:25 --> 00:45:29
It's clearly a Scrapie Disease.
It's called Chronic Wasting Disease

540
00:45:29 --> 00:45:33
or CWD.
It occurs in herds of deer,

541
00:45:33 --> 00:45:37
as well as in elk.  And if you look
at the incidence of animals that are

542
00:45:37 --> 00:45:41
affected, there are several herds in
our country that are affected.

543
00:45:41 --> 00:45:44
And, again, there's a lot of worry
out there, it's a little below the

544
00:45:44 --> 00:45:48
surface now, but there's a lot of
worry out there that if you eat that

545
00:45:48 --> 00:45:52
stuff you might develop CJD.
Importantly, there are no

546
00:45:52 --> 00:45:55
documented cases,
no documented cases so far.

547
00:45:55 --> 00:45:59
There are some reported cases but
they've been investigated and found

548
00:45:59 --> 00:46:03
probably not to be associated with
exposure to this meet.

549
00:46:03 --> 00:46:07
Nevertheless, there's a fear that
the species barrier might be

550
00:46:07 --> 00:46:12
breached in some individuals,
and those individuals would develop

551
00:46:12 --> 00:46:16
this disease.  So with that I will
stop.  Thank you for you attention.

552
00:46:16 --> 00:46:19
Good luck on the final.  And don't
forget office hours.  [APPLAUSE]
