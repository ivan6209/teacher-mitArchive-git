1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
OK.  So I'm Claudette Gardel.
And I am in the instructor of this

2
00:00:19 --> 00:00:23
course.  And I've been asked to do
the second immunology lecture

3
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
because Professor Jacks
is out of town.

4
00:00:27 --> 00:00:31
So he talked to you on Friday.
And he introduced the topic of

5
00:00:31 --> 00:00:36
immunology.  And he talked about the
cells that one finds in the blood.

6
00:00:36 --> 00:00:41
And these are the cells that are
important for immunology.

7
00:00:41 --> 00:00:46
They're responsible for the immune
response.  And he mentioned,

8
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
I believe he mentioned mast cells
and macrophages and neutrophils and

9
00:00:50 --> 00:00:55
plasma cells and B cells and T cells.
And those are really the main

10
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00
players of immunology.
He also, no, no,

11
00:01:00 --> 00:01:06
no.  He also talked to you about the
incredible diversity,

12
00:01:06 --> 00:01:12
incredible, tremendous repertoire of
antibodies that we have that

13
00:01:12 --> 00:01:17
recognize variable,
based on their variable regions they

14
00:01:17 --> 00:01:23
can recognize a whole slew of
antigens.  OK?

15
00:01:23 --> 00:01:29
And this is like a graphic
depiction of an antibody.

16
00:01:29 --> 00:01:34
This is a hetero-dimer,
excuse me, tetramer.  And this

17
00:01:34 --> 00:01:40
diversity is a result of gene
rearrangement in the variable region

18
00:01:40 --> 00:01:46
of the antibody chains.
And so you heard VDJ recombination.

19
00:01:46 --> 00:01:51
So this is at the level of DNA
recombination.

20
00:01:51 --> 00:01:57
Similar to the gene rearrangement
that occurs in B cells that results

21
00:01:57 --> 00:02:03
in the diversity of antibodies,
T cells also have rearrangement for

22
00:02:03 --> 00:02:09
their variable region of
their T cell receptors.

23
00:02:09 --> 00:02:16
So we have a population of B cells
and T cells that can recognize a

24
00:02:16 --> 00:02:23
wide array of foreign antigens.
OK.  So this is immunology.  This

25
00:02:23 --> 00:02:30
is a topic that makes grown
scientists run away.

26
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
And partly it is because there are
so many terms and so much jargon and

27
00:02:34 --> 00:02:39
it just seems so confusing to get it
all straight.  And it is.

28
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
There is a lot of jargon.
So my goal in this lecture is to

29
00:02:43 --> 00:02:48
try and make you understand
conceptually what's going on.

30
00:02:48 --> 00:02:53
OK?  And I don't have handouts,
but I promise I will put this on,

31
00:02:53 --> 00:02:57
now, this isn't very helpful.  But I
will put this PowerPoint presentation

32
00:02:57 --> 00:03:02
on the Web.
And I have like tried to elucidate

33
00:03:02 --> 00:03:07
the main concepts of immunology,
which is so cool.  It is like such a

34
00:03:07 --> 00:03:12
cool topic.  OK?
So we're going to get through this.

35
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
OK.  So what is immunology?  It's
how we fight infections.

36
00:03:16 --> 00:03:21
And what causes infections?
Pathogens.  So let's have a look

37
00:03:21 --> 00:03:26
and see what we're up against.
This is what we're fighting.  OK?

38
00:03:26 --> 00:03:31
There are parasites and funguses,

39
00:03:31 --> 00:03:36
fungi and bacteria and viruses.  And
they cause a whole slew of diseases.

40
00:03:36 --> 00:03:41
You've heard of some of them, right?
Smallpox we've heard of.

41
00:03:41 --> 00:03:46
Influenza.  We're going to study
AIDS.  We talked about polio a

42
00:03:46 --> 00:03:51
little bit.  We had cholera perhaps.
And tetanus we talked about.  And

43
00:03:51 --> 00:03:56
what must every pathogen do to cause
disease?  They must enter you.

44
00:03:56 --> 00:04:01
They want to live on you.
They want to grow on you.

45
00:04:01 --> 00:04:05
You are their food source.
So they want to enter you.  They

46
00:04:05 --> 00:04:09
want to evade the immune system,
which we're about to learn about.

47
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
They want to colonize and multiply
and grow.  And then they want to

48
00:04:13 --> 00:04:17
spread to other hosts.
That's all they want.  Whether you

49
00:04:17 --> 00:04:21
get hurt in the process they don't
care.  They can cause disease three

50
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
different ways.
Pathogens have basically three main

51
00:04:25 --> 00:04:30
strategies to cause disease.
They can cause disease from an

52
00:04:30 --> 00:04:36
extracellular point of view.
And so here I've drawn some,

53
00:04:36 --> 00:04:42
could you keep it down?  Some
epithelial cells.

54
00:04:42 --> 00:04:48
These little spots here are nuclei.
The pink represents damage.  So

55
00:04:48 --> 00:04:54
these pathogens can cause damage
without being in close proximity to

56
00:04:54 --> 00:05:00
the cell.  This is usually the
result of secreting a toxin.

57
00:05:00 --> 00:05:04
And this occurs with tetanus,
anthrax, gangrene.  Other pathogens

58
00:05:04 --> 00:05:09
have to be right up close to the
cell surface to cause disease.

59
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
And this is true of the positive
agent of cholera.

60
00:05:13 --> 00:05:18
So they get up close and then they
can cause damage.

61
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
And then there are others that are
intracellular.

62
00:05:22 --> 00:05:27
They actually get within the cell.
And this is true of many bacterial

63
00:05:27 --> 00:05:32
pathogens like chlamydia and the
causative agents of tuberculosis.

64
00:05:32 --> 00:05:38
And it's true of every single virus.
OK.  So we have developed

65
00:05:38 --> 00:05:44
strategies to deal with this.
And this strategy goes under the

66
00:05:44 --> 00:05:50
main umbrella called the immune
response.  And the immune response

67
00:05:50 --> 00:05:56
can be divided into two main parts,
innate or nonspecific and/or acquire

68
00:05:56 --> 00:06:02
adaptive and specific.
OK.  So this slide is actually my

69
00:06:02 --> 00:06:07
summary slide.
And it's going to blow you away a

70
00:06:07 --> 00:06:12
little bit, but by the end of the
talk you're going to understand it.

71
00:06:12 --> 00:06:17
OK?  So we're going to go through
it really quickly,

72
00:06:17 --> 00:06:22
you're going to like glaze over,
and then we're going to go through

73
00:06:22 --> 00:06:27
it.  Oops.  What happened?
Tom?  OK.  Oh, that was good.

74
00:06:27 --> 00:06:32
OK.  So the innate.
The innate response is composed of

75
00:06:32 --> 00:06:37
things that we have all the time,
natural barriers to the disease.

76
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41
They're always present,
it's a quick response, and it

77
00:06:41 --> 00:06:46
doesn't result in anything
long-lived.  The acquired or

78
00:06:46 --> 00:06:51
adaptive response takes longer.
And it's divided into two kinds,

79
00:06:51 --> 00:06:56
humoral and/or the other kind is
cell-mediated or sometimes it's

80
00:06:56 --> 00:07:01
called cellular and sometimes it's
called cell-based.

81
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
This is why immunology is so
confusing.  Professor Jacks used the

82
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09
word cell-based.
And the main players of these,

83
00:07:09 --> 00:07:14
they're going to be shown here.  So
humoral has macrophages,

84
00:07:14 --> 00:07:18
helper T cells and B cells.
The main player of the cell-base is

85
00:07:18 --> 00:07:23
killer T cells.
This is the pathway that they work.

86
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
You're going to learn about this in
detail.  Lysosome breaks up the

87
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
antigen into epitopes.
It's presented on MHC-2 molecules.

88
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
In the case of cell-based it's a
proteasome that breaks it up into

89
00:07:36 --> 00:07:41
epitopes presented on MHC-1
molecules.  And it's presented to

90
00:07:41 --> 00:07:46
the helper T cell by way of its
receptor which is associated with

91
00:07:46 --> 00:07:50
CD4 or to the killer T cell which
has a T cell receptor with an

92
00:07:50 --> 00:07:55
accessory protein called CD8.
The end result of the humoral

93
00:07:55 --> 00:08:00
response, antibodies
and memory B cells.

94
00:08:00 --> 00:08:04
The end result of the cell-based
response, memory T cells.

95
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
That's it.  OK.  So that's what
you're going to know by the end of

96
00:08:08 --> 00:08:12
the lecture.  Here's the immune
response.  Excuse me.

97
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
Here's the innate.  We're going to
discuss the innate.

98
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
This is like an exploded diagram of
a human sort of.

99
00:08:20 --> 00:08:24
Now, I talked about pathogens and I
talked about bacteria being

100
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
pathogens, but not all bacteria are
pathogens.  In fact,

101
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
we are colonized by bacteria.
We are colonized by microbes.

102
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
In fact, they outnumber us.  There
are ten to the thirteen cells that

103
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
we have and there are ten to the
fourteen bacteria.

104
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
They live on your skin.
They live in our large intestine.

105
00:08:44 --> 00:08:48
And this is a good thing, OK,
because they're commensals and they

106
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
take up space to prevent real
professional pathogens from honing

107
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
in on that space.
So commensals are beneficial.

108
00:08:56 --> 00:09:00
Plus we have this thing called skin.

109
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
Skin is a good barrier.
It prevents us from looking like a

110
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
piece of meat.
You know, it's tough.

111
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
It's thick.  It's salty.
It has a low pH.  It's not exactly

112
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
37 degrees.  It's a little bit
cooler.  Pathogens like to be at 37

113
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
degrees.  It has fatty acids which
is sort of anti-microbial.

114
00:09:18 --> 00:09:22
Skin is good, yet some pathogens
have evolved systems to get through

115
00:09:22 --> 00:09:26
the skin.  For instance,
malaria gets in on a mosquito bite.

116
00:09:26 --> 00:09:30
Yersinia pestis, the causative
agent of bubonic plague which gets

117
00:09:30 --> 00:09:34
in on a flee bite.
OK.  So some can get through the

118
00:09:34 --> 00:09:40
skin.  And then,
of course, there are cuts.

119
00:09:40 --> 00:09:45
The eye is mostly sterile due to
lysozyme which is an enzyme that

120
00:09:45 --> 00:09:51
breaks down bacterial cell walls.
Your respiratory tract is

121
00:09:51 --> 00:09:57
surprisingly sterile considering
there are 500 to 1,

122
00:09:57 --> 00:10:02
00 microbes per cubic meter of air.
And as you're sitting here at rest

123
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
in 10-250 breathing in about six
liters a minute,

124
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
that translates to about 10,
00 microbes a day.  And why is this?

125
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
But I just told you that your
respiratory tract is relatively

126
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
sterile.  And that's because it's
lined with mucus which traps the

127
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
microbes.  And the cells along the
respiratory tract have these little

128
00:10:22 --> 00:10:26
cilia that look like little
hair-like projectiles.

129
00:10:26 --> 00:10:30
And they're beating up,
constantly beating up the microbes.

130
00:10:30 --> 00:10:34
And they get to the back of your
throat and you swallow them.

131
00:10:34 --> 00:10:38
OK?  So you swallow them.  And then
the stomach, a sterile environment

132
00:10:38 --> 00:10:42
because of the low pH.
There are some microbes that can

133
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
live in the stomach and they cause
ulcers.  Small intestine.

134
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
Is that sterile or not?  Nobody
knows.  It's very sterile.

135
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
It's a hostile environment.
It's full of bile.  If you can live

136
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
there, like vibrio cholerae,
you'll be causing disease.  The

137
00:10:58 --> 00:11:02
large intestine.
Is that sterile?

138
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
No.  No.  There are so many
bacteria in the large intestine that

139
00:11:06 --> 00:11:11
per gram of feces there's ten to the
eleventh bacteria.

140
00:11:11 --> 00:11:15
That's a one with 11 zeros after it.
So it's a lot of bacteria.

141
00:11:15 --> 00:11:19
And this is a good thing.  E.
coli secretes little vitamin K for

142
00:11:19 --> 00:11:24
us and there are commensals.
The bladder should be sterile.

143
00:11:24 --> 00:11:28
The kidneys should be sterile.  And
the flushing action of urine is

144
00:11:28 --> 00:11:33
constantly pushing down microbes
that might be wanting to infect us.

145
00:11:33 --> 00:11:37
OK.  Within the blood there are also
some innate components.

146
00:11:37 --> 00:11:41
One of them is the complement
system.  The complement system is a

147
00:11:41 --> 00:11:45
series of serum proteins that can
recognize nonspecifically many

148
00:11:45 --> 00:11:50
different bacterial pathogens.
And they come, and it's an

149
00:11:50 --> 00:11:54
enzymatic cascade,
and they land on the surface of the

150
00:11:54 --> 00:11:58
bacteria.  And then they can either
recruit other members of the immune

151
00:11:58 --> 00:12:02
system or they can actually
physically drill a hole in the

152
00:12:02 --> 00:12:07
bacteria and then kill it like a
little oil rig.

153
00:12:07 --> 00:12:12
And then there are macrophages which
I like to abbreviate this way,

154
00:12:12 --> 00:12:17
macrophage.  Macrophages are white
blood cells that engulf,

155
00:12:17 --> 00:12:22
they swallow, they phagocitize.
Phago means to eat.  Macro means a

156
00:12:22 --> 00:12:27
lot.  They eat a lot,
and they eat nonspecifically.

157
00:12:27 --> 00:12:32
They just swallow and take things
away nonspecifically.

158
00:12:32 --> 00:12:37
There are also interferons,
a component of the innate response.

159
00:12:37 --> 00:12:42
And that's interesting in that when
a cell is infected with a virus

160
00:12:42 --> 00:12:47
sometimes it will secrete.
And it knows it's infected.

161
00:12:47 --> 00:12:52
Sometimes it knows it's infected,
and sometimes it has the ability to

162
00:12:52 --> 00:12:57
secrete interferon.
And there are other cells that have

163
00:12:57 --> 00:13:02
receptors for interferon.
And when it's through a signal

164
00:13:02 --> 00:13:07
transduction mediated pathway they
go into an anti-virus state and they

165
00:13:07 --> 00:13:12
stop making protein and they start
cutting away RNAs.

166
00:13:12 --> 00:13:17
And so, actually, some of the bad
feelings that we have when we have

167
00:13:17 --> 00:13:22
flu is not really the flu virus.
It's the result of interferons

168
00:13:22 --> 00:13:27
being globally secreted in our body
and our cells sort of

169
00:13:27 --> 00:13:32
shutting down.  OK.
So here's the inflammatory response.

170
00:13:32 --> 00:13:36
OK?  And here we have a splinter.
This is a piece of wood coming in

171
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
and look.  Oh,
look, it's coated with little

172
00:13:40 --> 00:13:44
bacteria.  OK?
And, actually,

173
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
this experiment was done by
Mesnekoff many,

174
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
many years ago where he took a
splinter and he put it in a starfish

175
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
leg.  Leg?  You know,
one of those little projectiles of

176
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
the starfish.  And he looked.
And he saw these cells trying to

177
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
engulf, actually trying to engulf
the wood.  And that turned out to be

178
00:14:04 --> 00:14:08
the macrophage.
OK?  So he was actually the first

179
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12
person who discovered the macrophage.
So here we see the splinter

180
00:14:12 --> 00:14:16
penetrating the dermis.
And these cells here are called

181
00:14:16 --> 00:14:20
mast cells.  And they're full of
vesicles that secrete histamines.

182
00:14:20 --> 00:14:24
And the histamines cause the blood
vessel that's underlying to become

183
00:14:24 --> 00:14:28
more permeable such that the
macrophages and neutrophils,

184
00:14:28 --> 00:14:32
phagocytes can come to the area and
swallow the bacteria.

185
00:14:32 --> 00:14:36
So this is histamine,
these are the macrophages that are

186
00:14:36 --> 00:14:41
coming and swallowing.
And also you can see these little

187
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
red dots are complement.
Those are the serum proteins that

188
00:14:45 --> 00:14:49
will come and land nonspecifically
on bacteria and lyse them.

189
00:14:49 --> 00:14:53
And the macrophage will also
secrete something we

190
00:14:53 --> 00:14:58
call cytokines.
Cytokines are signaling molecules

191
00:14:58 --> 00:15:02
that immune cells use.
And there is a whole array of

192
00:15:02 --> 00:15:07
cytokines and they have a whole
different variety of affects.

193
00:15:07 --> 00:15:11
Some cytokines have global affects
upon us.  They cause us to have

194
00:15:11 --> 00:15:16
fever and not feel too well.
OK.  So after the infection you'll

195
00:15:16 --> 00:15:21
notice the macrophage is swallowing
a dead, infected cell.

196
00:15:21 --> 00:15:25
They clean up.  And then these
cells with grow and

197
00:15:25 --> 00:15:31
will be repaired.
So this is the inflammatory response.

198
00:15:31 --> 00:15:37
The hallmark is redness and
swelling and heat.

199
00:15:37 --> 00:15:43
So now let's discuss the acquired
response.  The acquired takes longer.

200
00:15:43 --> 00:15:49
There was the humoral cell-mediated.
The end result of the humoral

201
00:15:49 --> 00:15:55
response are antibodies and memory B
cells.  The end response of

202
00:15:55 --> 00:16:00
cell-mediated are killer T cells.
We're going to talk about the

203
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04
humoral response right now.
And I'm going to give you an

204
00:16:04 --> 00:16:08
example of a disease.
This is vibrio cholerae.

205
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
It's a bacterium that causes
cholera.  There are some places in

206
00:16:11 --> 00:16:15
the world where some people get
cholera.  And this person is

207
00:16:15 --> 00:16:19
suffering.  And the doctor has
squeezed her skin,

208
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
and you can still see that the skin
is upright because she is severely

209
00:16:22 --> 00:16:26
dehydrated.  The disease is marked
by severe diarrhea that can lead to

210
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
death within hours.
And they measure --

211
00:16:30 --> 00:16:33
What they do to treat cholera is
they measure the amount of diarrhea

212
00:16:33 --> 00:16:37
that happens, and that is the exact
amount that they replace in fluids.

213
00:16:37 --> 00:16:41
The lifecycle of the bacterium is
shown here.  You ingest contaminated

214
00:16:41 --> 00:16:45
food or water.
The bacteria get through the low pH

215
00:16:45 --> 00:16:48
of the stomach.
They swim through the mucus gel

216
00:16:48 --> 00:16:52
overlying the small intestine
epithelial cells at which point they

217
00:16:52 --> 00:16:56
adhere.  And they start to elaborate
cholera toxin and other factors that

218
00:16:56 --> 00:17:00
allow them to colonize
and multiply.

219
00:17:00 --> 00:17:04
It's the action of cholera toxin
which causes the severe diarrhea,

220
00:17:04 --> 00:17:09
and it releases the vibrios into the
environment and the cycle continues.

221
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
And some of you had in your signal
transduction the action of cholera

222
00:17:13 --> 00:17:18
toxin where it like turns on the
alpha protein in the intestinal cell

223
00:17:18 --> 00:17:23
causing high levels of cyclic AMP
which results in chloride ions and

224
00:17:23 --> 00:17:28
salt followed by water going into
the lumen of the small intestine.

225
00:17:28 --> 00:17:32
A person can die in as little as
eight hours due to the action of the

226
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
toxin, and yet it's absolutely
treatable with oral hydration.

227
00:17:36 --> 00:17:41
And yet still 50,000 people die
each year because it can take up to

228
00:17:41 --> 00:17:45
40 liters of liquids to restore
hydration.  And sometimes it takes

229
00:17:45 --> 00:17:50
place in areas where there's not
water or for some reason small

230
00:17:50 --> 00:17:54
babies cannot take in the water.
Without treatment 70% will die.

231
00:17:54 --> 00:17:59
With treatment less
than 1% will die.

232
00:17:59 --> 00:18:03
Now, there are some places in the
world where cholera is endemic.

233
00:18:03 --> 00:18:07
People get it and they get treated
with oral rehydration.

234
00:18:07 --> 00:18:12
And once you get it you don't get
it again.  You will have developed

235
00:18:12 --> 00:18:16
long-lived immunity to cholera.
And this long-lived immunity is a

236
00:18:16 --> 00:18:21
result of the humoral response.
So the next slide will show you the

237
00:18:21 --> 00:18:25
two key members,
actually three key members of the

238
00:18:25 --> 00:18:30
humoral response dealing
with a pathogen.

239
00:18:30 --> 00:18:34
So here we have a macrophage,
here we have a B cell.  And look,

240
00:18:34 --> 00:18:39
this little red dot could be a
pathogen, it could be an antigen,

241
00:18:39 --> 00:18:43
and it's about to be engulfed by the
macrophage and it's about to be

242
00:18:43 --> 00:18:48
recognized on the surface,
it's about to be recognized by the

243
00:18:48 --> 00:18:53
variable region of the antibody
which is on the surface of this B

244
00:18:53 --> 00:18:58
cell.  This is the B cell.
This is macrophage.  OK.

245
00:18:58 --> 00:19:02
So the macrophage swallows it and it
goes into an endosome.

246
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
It endocytosis it or phagocytosis.
It could be a phagosome or an

247
00:19:06 --> 00:19:10
endosome it's called.
The B cell does exactly the same

248
00:19:10 --> 00:19:15
thing.  It brings it in on the
antibody.  And so it's also in an

249
00:19:15 --> 00:19:19
endosome or phagosome.
And see this little circle here?

250
00:19:19 --> 00:19:23
That's a lysosome.  Do you remember
lysosome?  We had them early.

251
00:19:23 --> 00:19:27
This is not lysozyme which is the
enzyme that's in the tears that

252
00:19:27 --> 00:19:32
break down cell walls.
No.  This is an organelle that is

253
00:19:32 --> 00:19:36
found in cells,
and it's full of degradative enzymes,

254
00:19:36 --> 00:19:41
proteases, nucleases,
lipases.  And it just fuses with the

255
00:19:41 --> 00:19:46
phagosome and chews it up into
little itty bitty pieces.

256
00:19:46 --> 00:19:50
And these little itty bitty pieces
are loaded onto these molecules

257
00:19:50 --> 00:19:55
called MHC class II molecules.
And they display little eight or

258
00:19:55 --> 00:20:00
nine amino acid snippets of what was
just chewed up.

259
00:20:00 --> 00:20:05
The only two cells in the body that
make MHC-2 molecules are the

260
00:20:05 --> 00:20:10
macrophages and the B cells.
And who are they displaying it to?

261
00:20:10 --> 00:20:15
Well, there's this third cell right
here.  It's the helper T cell.

262
00:20:15 --> 00:20:20
And the helper T cell recognizes
the MHC-2 class molecule in

263
00:20:20 --> 00:20:25
conjunction with the epitope by
virtue of its T cell receptor.

264
00:20:25 --> 00:20:30
OK.  And here are some helper T
cells.

265
00:20:30 --> 00:20:33
Here's either a macrophage or a B
cell.  This sort of looks like a B

266
00:20:33 --> 00:20:37
cell.  It's an antigen presenting
cell of which there are only two

267
00:20:37 --> 00:20:41
kinds, B cells and macrophages,
and they have MHC class II.  OK.

268
00:20:41 --> 00:20:45
Here's another way of looking at it,
pathogen engulf.

269
00:20:45 --> 00:20:48
There's the phagosome or endosome.
It looks like the lysosome is

270
00:20:48 --> 00:20:52
already fused.
It's broken up into little

271
00:20:52 --> 00:20:56
fragments.  Peptide fragments are
called epitopes.

272
00:20:56 --> 00:21:00
They're loaded onto MCH class II
molecules.

273
00:21:00 --> 00:21:04
Presented to the helper T cell.
And now, look, here's the T cell

274
00:21:04 --> 00:21:08
receptor.  It has an accessory
protein.  The helper T cell

275
00:21:08 --> 00:21:13
receptor's accessory protein
is called CD4.

276
00:21:13 --> 00:21:23
OK.  So, now, remember the helper T

277
00:21:23 --> 00:21:30
cell is going to bind to the
macrophage?  And it's going to --

278
00:21:30 --> 00:21:35
Only if it recognizes the epitope in
conjunction with MHC-2.

279
00:21:35 --> 00:21:40
And should that happen the
macrophage sends out some cytokines,

280
00:21:40 --> 00:21:45
special cytokines that causes the
helper T cell to also send out

281
00:21:45 --> 00:21:50
cytokines to itself and causes it to
clonally expand.

282
00:21:50 --> 00:21:55
OK?  So many more of these helper T
cells are around.

283
00:21:55 --> 00:22:00
So here we go.  It's found the
macrophage.

284
00:22:00 --> 00:22:04
It becomes activated.
It becomes in an activated state.

285
00:22:04 --> 00:22:09
It clonally expands but it still
remains in its sort of activated

286
00:22:09 --> 00:22:14
state.  And should it encounter a B
cell that has swallowed the exact

287
00:22:14 --> 00:22:19
same antigen or pathogen and is
displaying the exact same epitope

288
00:22:19 --> 00:22:24
then it causes the B cell to do
something through the action of

289
00:22:24 --> 00:22:29
cytokines.  So here it's finding the
B cell.  It has the exact

290
00:22:29 --> 00:22:34
same epitope.
And it sends these cytokines and it

291
00:22:34 --> 00:22:40
causes the B cell to clonally expand
into memory B cells and also to

292
00:22:40 --> 00:22:45
differentiate into plasma B cells
that are now secreting the antibody

293
00:22:45 --> 00:22:51
that originally recognized the
surface of the bacterium or the

294
00:22:51 --> 00:22:57
antigen.  And now these are now
being secreted into the blood or

295
00:22:57 --> 00:23:02
wherever they are.  OK.
Here it is again,

296
00:23:02 --> 00:23:06
helper T cell recognizes the B cell,
sends a signal, clonal expansion.

297
00:23:06 --> 00:23:10
The ones where the antibodies remain
on the surface are called memory

298
00:23:10 --> 00:23:14
cells.  Now they're in greater
abundance.  Some of them

299
00:23:14 --> 00:23:18
differentiate into these cells that
have lots of endoplasmic reticulum

300
00:23:18 --> 00:23:22
because they're synthesizing a
secreted protein.

301
00:23:22 --> 00:23:26
Now it's secreted and it's called
antibody.  So we've got all these

302
00:23:26 --> 00:23:30
secreted antibodies and all these
memory T cells, excuse me, B cells.

303
00:23:30 --> 00:23:35
And this is the reason why the
secondary response is greater.

304
00:23:35 --> 00:23:41
OK?  So the first time you
encounter a pathogen or an antigen

305
00:23:41 --> 00:23:46
it takes a while and it's not as
great the magnitude of antibodies.

306
00:23:46 --> 00:23:52
But the second time, because we
have all those extra memory cells

307
00:23:52 --> 00:23:58
around, it's much quicker and it's
also a greater magnitude.

308
00:23:58 --> 00:24:01
Now, if some of you were observing
that there are these things called

309
00:24:01 --> 00:24:05
IgM and IgG.  Well,
this refers to different classes of

310
00:24:05 --> 00:24:09
antibodies.  And there are different
classes.  IgM are the ones that are

311
00:24:09 --> 00:24:13
sort of on the surface of the B
cells.  They're sort of still

312
00:24:13 --> 00:24:16
tethered at some point.
And then as they become plasma

313
00:24:16 --> 00:24:20
cells they actually have secreted
antibodies.  And there are different

314
00:24:20 --> 00:24:24
classes depending upon what fluids
the antibodies will be found in.

315
00:24:24 --> 00:24:28
For instance, IgG is the
predominant antibody

316
00:24:28 --> 00:24:32
found in the blood.
IgA is found in some mucouses and

317
00:24:32 --> 00:24:37
tears and mother's milk.
So babies don't have any immune

318
00:24:37 --> 00:24:43
system, but if they're nursed they
get the IgA from their mother.

319
00:24:43 --> 00:24:48
And, actually, it goes into their
small intestine and just goes right

320
00:24:48 --> 00:24:53
across into their bloodstream.
So it actually helps them because

321
00:24:53 --> 00:24:59
it takes the babies a while to
develop antibody-making systems.

322
00:24:59 --> 00:25:04
IgE is an antibody that has been
implicated in allergic responses.

323
00:25:04 --> 00:25:09
Do you remember the mast cells that
have those ready pockets of

324
00:25:09 --> 00:25:14
histamine ready to like secrete out
and cause like a ray of affects?

325
00:25:14 --> 00:25:19
Well, they also have receptors for
IgE.  And so some of us have

326
00:25:19 --> 00:25:24
allergies, right?
And when we have allergies we

327
00:25:24 --> 00:25:30
develop IgE to ragweed
or cat dander.

328
00:25:30 --> 00:25:36
And as a result,
if we're exposed to this antigen we

329
00:25:36 --> 00:25:42
can have this reaction involving IgE
in mast cells resulting in histamine

330
00:25:42 --> 00:25:48
release.  And if it's very bad then
it can actually result in

331
00:25:48 --> 00:25:54
anaphylactic shock.
OK.  So antibodies,

332
00:25:54 --> 00:26:00
you know, we have a whole production
of antibodies made.

333
00:26:00 --> 00:26:04
But how do they actually fight
disease?  What do they do?

334
00:26:04 --> 00:26:09
So we've got them floating in our
blood?  How do they rid ourselves of

335
00:26:09 --> 00:26:13
the infection?
Well, they do it three ways.

336
00:26:13 --> 00:26:18
OK.  Remember vibrio cholerae?
It wants to get to the intestinal

337
00:26:18 --> 00:26:22
epithelium to cause disease.
Here's a bacterium here.  Here are

338
00:26:22 --> 00:26:27
antibodies that are specific to the
surface of vibrio cholerae,

339
00:26:27 --> 00:26:32
this bacterium here.  It is coated
with this furriness of antibodies.

340
00:26:32 --> 00:26:37
Can it touch the tissue?
No it cannot.  It is sterically

341
00:26:37 --> 00:26:42
hindered from getting to its surface.
And this would be true of a toxin,

342
00:26:42 --> 00:26:47
too, of a toxin, a protein toxin.  A
toxin is coated with antibodies.

343
00:26:47 --> 00:26:52
It cannot get to a receptor and
cause ill effects.

344
00:26:52 --> 00:26:57
OK.  So now we've got these
antigens and bacteria and they're

345
00:26:57 --> 00:27:02
coated with antibodies.
Opsonization.  This is derived from

346
00:27:02 --> 00:27:08
a Greek word which means seasoning
on food like salt and pepper.

347
00:27:08 --> 00:27:13
So here's a pathogen.  It's coated
with antibodies.

348
00:27:13 --> 00:27:19
In comes a macrophage and swallows
it up.  Now, the macrophage would

349
00:27:19 --> 00:27:24
devour this thing anyway without the
antibodies.  But it might be slower.

350
00:27:24 --> 00:27:30
It might be a little pokey.  When
you have --

351
00:27:30 --> 00:27:34
It's like seasoning on food.
When you have antibodies it's going

352
00:27:34 --> 00:27:39
to do it voraciously.
And why is that?  It's because the

353
00:27:39 --> 00:27:44
variable region binds to the
bacterium or the pathogen or the

354
00:27:44 --> 00:27:49
antigen.  What's sticking out is the
constant region of the antibody.

355
00:27:49 --> 00:27:54
No matter what's on the variable
region the constant region is the

356
00:27:54 --> 00:27:59
same.  So the macrophages have
receptors that recognize this

357
00:27:59 --> 00:28:04
constant region and they zip it up
and they swallow it.

358
00:28:04 --> 00:28:08
Likewise antibody triggers the
complement system,

359
00:28:08 --> 00:28:12
so although the complement system
might come in slowly,

360
00:28:12 --> 00:28:16
when it sees antibodies bound to a
bacterium it comes in and it does

361
00:28:16 --> 00:28:21
its little oil drill thing instantly.
OK.  So that's how antibodies

362
00:28:21 --> 00:28:25
prevent disease.
Here's a picture of the macrophage

363
00:28:25 --> 00:28:29
with its receptors.
This end of the molecule of the

364
00:28:29 --> 00:28:34
antibody is called FC.
So the receptor is called the FC

365
00:28:34 --> 00:28:40
receptor.  And it just coats it and
brings it in and ingests it.

366
00:28:40 --> 00:28:46
OK.  So we've got antibodies as a
result of the humoral response.

367
00:28:46 --> 00:28:51
Would they be affective in
preventing a toxin from binding to a

368
00:28:51 --> 00:28:57
surface if we had antibodies against
that toxin?  You bet.

369
00:28:57 --> 00:29:03
It's very good for pathogens that
cause extracellular disease

370
00:29:03 --> 00:29:08
away from the cell.
It's very good for toxins,

371
00:29:08 --> 00:29:12
extremely good.  What about
preventing cholera again?

372
00:29:12 --> 00:29:16
Can it prevent a pathogen from
binding to a surface,

373
00:29:16 --> 00:29:20
an adherent bacterium?
Yes.  We just showed you it did.

374
00:29:20 --> 00:29:24
Sterical hindrance.  But what about
the case of viruses or other things

375
00:29:24 --> 00:29:28
that are intracellular,
that cause disease from within,

376
00:29:28 --> 00:29:32
would antibodies be effective there?
Only if they were caught before they

377
00:29:32 --> 00:29:37
got in.  But once they're in they're
protected from macrophages.

378
00:29:37 --> 00:29:41
They're protected from antibodies.
They're in a nice, warm,

379
00:29:41 --> 00:29:46
nutrient-rich environment.
They're looking pretty good.

380
00:29:46 --> 00:29:51
And many professional pathogens
have opted for this tact.

381
00:29:51 --> 00:29:55
So what we've done is we've
developed the other wing of the

382
00:29:55 --> 00:30:00
immune system called cell-mediated
to deal with intracellular

383
00:30:00 --> 00:30:05
pathogens.
And these are the stars of the

384
00:30:05 --> 00:30:09
cell-mediated or cell-based or
cellular system.

385
00:30:09 --> 00:30:14
And they are called killer T cells.
And they are the coolest cell in

386
00:30:14 --> 00:30:18
your body.  They're like the
Terminator, you know,

387
00:30:18 --> 00:30:23
Arnold Schwarzenegger,
the Terminator.  And so they go

388
00:30:23 --> 00:30:28
around and they like will protect us.
So let's show you this.  OK.

389
00:30:28 --> 00:30:32
This thing that looks like a
suitcase is my drawing of let's say

390
00:30:32 --> 00:30:36
an epithelial cell that has been
like sandblasted away.

391
00:30:36 --> 00:30:41
OK?  One side of it is sandblasted
away so we can look in.

392
00:30:41 --> 00:30:45
Oh, look, there's its nucleus and
there's its endoplasmic reticulum.

393
00:30:45 --> 00:30:50
And what are these things on the
surface of the cell?

394
00:30:50 --> 00:30:54
Well, it's called MHC class I
molecule and it's presenting and

395
00:30:54 --> 00:30:59
epitope of eight to
nine amino acids.

396
00:30:59 --> 00:31:04
All nucleated cells in the body.
Every cell in your body that has a

397
00:31:04 --> 00:31:09
nucleus is presenting MHC class I
molecules on their surface,

398
00:31:09 --> 00:31:17
presenting epitopes on MHC class I.

399
00:31:17 --> 00:31:23
And where did these epitopes come
from?  They come from proteins that

400
00:31:23 --> 00:31:29
are found in the cytoplasm.
At some point routinely proteins

401
00:31:29 --> 00:31:35
are channeled through this organelle
called a proteasome.

402
00:31:35 --> 00:31:39
They get threaded through and they
get broken up into eight or nine

403
00:31:39 --> 00:31:44
amino acid snippets,
and they get loaded onto MHC class I

404
00:31:44 --> 00:31:48
molecules in their final stages of
being transported to the membrane.

405
00:31:48 --> 00:31:53
And who are they presenting, these
MHC class I molecules to?

406
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
They're presenting them to killer T
cells by way of the

407
00:31:57 --> 00:32:02
T cell receptor.
Now, although most of the epitopes

408
00:32:02 --> 00:32:08
that are presented on these MHC
class I molecules are derived from

409
00:32:08 --> 00:32:13
your own proteins,
host proteins.  Any killer T cell

410
00:32:13 --> 00:32:19
that could have recognized a host
protein, in conjunction with the

411
00:32:19 --> 00:32:25
MHC-1 molecule,
has been eliminated early in

412
00:32:25 --> 00:32:30
development.
Early in development if there is

413
00:32:30 --> 00:32:35
recognition.  That killer T cell has
been targeted for apoptosis and dies.

414
00:32:35 --> 00:32:40
And this is true with B cells,
too.  So if they have an antibody on

415
00:32:40 --> 00:32:45
their surface that can recognize a
self protein they are eliminated.

416
00:32:45 --> 00:32:50
And this is called clonal deletion.
So what is left in our blood are

417
00:32:50 --> 00:32:55
only killer T cells that can
recognize foreign epitopes in

418
00:32:55 --> 00:33:01
conjunction with the MHC
class I molecule.

419
00:33:01 --> 00:33:05
And so if the cell is infected,
and it is because I drew in these

420
00:33:05 --> 00:33:10
chlamydia, and if some of these
proteins are chlamydia proteins and

421
00:33:10 --> 00:33:15
they are being presented on these
MHC class I molecules,

422
00:33:15 --> 00:33:19
and the right killer T cell with the
receptor that comes by and

423
00:33:19 --> 00:33:24
recognizes it,
if recognition occurs two things

424
00:33:24 --> 00:33:29
happen.  OK.  Here's the killer T
cell.  Here's the MHC-1 with the

425
00:33:29 --> 00:33:34
chlamydia epitope or a
pathogenic epitope.

426
00:33:34 --> 00:33:37
A foreign epitope sitting right
there.  The killer T cell says oh,

427
00:33:37 --> 00:33:41
my God.  We have a cell that's
infected.  Maybe there are other

428
00:33:41 --> 00:33:45
cells that are infected.
I've got to make more of me.

429
00:33:45 --> 00:33:48
And it clonally expands to make
more of itself with the exact same T

430
00:33:48 --> 00:33:52
cell receptor that's going to
recognize this epitope.

431
00:33:52 --> 00:33:56
It also punches a whole in the cell
using perforin.

432
00:33:56 --> 00:34:00
It secretes this thing called
perforin.

433
00:34:00 --> 00:34:04
It punches a hole in the cell.
And if that's not good enough,

434
00:34:04 --> 00:34:09
it also secretes something called
granzyme B which causes this cell to

435
00:34:09 --> 00:34:13
undergo apoptosis.
So it like double kills it.

436
00:34:13 --> 00:34:18
OK?  And here's like another
picture of it.

437
00:34:18 --> 00:34:23
So here's the virus.
The proteins are loaded onto MHC

438
00:34:23 --> 00:34:27
class I molecules.
The killer T cell recognizes it by

439
00:34:27 --> 00:34:35
way of its T cell receptor.
And its successor protein is CD8.

440
00:34:35 --> 00:34:47
OK.  Here's the infected cell.

441
00:34:47 --> 00:34:52
Here is the killer T cell.  There's
the CD8.  This is perforin which is

442
00:34:52 --> 00:34:57
going to puncture a hole in the
infected cell.

443
00:34:57 --> 00:35:02
It figures it better kill this cell
now and save the rest of the body.

444
00:35:02 --> 00:35:06
It decides to sacrifice the infected
cell.  And here's granzyme that

445
00:35:06 --> 00:35:11
causes apoptosis.
And this cell then ends up looking

446
00:35:11 --> 00:35:16
like this with holes punched in it,
cytoplasm streaming away and starts

447
00:35:16 --> 00:35:24
to undergo apoptosis.

448
00:35:24 --> 00:35:30
And it makes more of itself.
So you end up with an army of

449
00:35:30 --> 00:35:37
memory killer T cells that are going
to recognize this exact pathogenic

450
00:35:37 --> 00:35:43
epitope.  Here's a killer T cell.
Here's an infected cell.  And

451
00:35:43 --> 00:35:53
here's a movie.

452
00:35:53 --> 00:36:00
Remember I said Terminator,
right?  OK.  There's the T cell.

453
00:36:00 --> 00:36:03
There's the cytoplasm streaming away.
And look it.  It just keeps going.

454
00:36:03 --> 00:36:07
It doesn't stop.  It just keeps
going.  Punching away.

455
00:36:07 --> 00:36:11
Wasn't that awesome?  Let's do it
again.  OK.

456
00:36:11 --> 00:36:28
That is so cool.

457
00:36:28 --> 00:36:32
Yup.  OK.  And they're on our side,
you know.  This is the army we have

458
00:36:32 --> 00:36:37
going in our blood.
It's just awesome.  It's just

459
00:36:37 --> 00:36:45
awesome.  OK.

460
00:36:45 --> 00:36:50
OK.  So this is the T cell receptor.
This is found in both helper T

461
00:36:50 --> 00:36:56
cells and killer T cells.
Notice it has a variable region.

462
00:36:56 --> 00:37:02
Early in its development the T cell
precursor actually has

463
00:37:02 --> 00:37:07
both CD4 and CD8.
And it's immature at this point.

464
00:37:07 --> 00:37:13
It doesn't know what it is yet.  It
has both.  And then as it develops

465
00:37:13 --> 00:37:18
it has only one left.
So if it remains with the CD4 it is

466
00:37:18 --> 00:37:24
a helper T cell.
If it has a CD8 in its final

467
00:37:24 --> 00:37:30
differentiated state it
is a killer T cell.

468
00:37:30 --> 00:37:35
And it's this accessory protein that,
actually that's it,

469
00:37:35 --> 00:37:40
that's what causes it.
And so if we look up close and

470
00:37:40 --> 00:37:45
personal at an MHC receptor,
this could be MHC-1 or MHC-2.

471
00:37:45 --> 00:37:51
This accessory protein could be CD4,
CD8.  So if it's MHC-1 the accessory

472
00:37:51 --> 00:37:56
protein is CD8.
If it's MHC-2 the accessory protein

473
00:37:56 --> 00:38:02
that fits MHC class
II would be CD4.

474
00:38:02 --> 00:38:09
So now I'm hoping that this will

475
00:38:09 --> 00:38:13
become a little bit more clear for
you.  So the innate response had

476
00:38:13 --> 00:38:18
lysozyme, the mucus,
ciliary ladder, skin and complement,

477
00:38:18 --> 00:38:23
and macrophages and mast cells.  It
doesn't last very long.

478
00:38:23 --> 00:38:27
And it's really not completely
effective in, you know.

479
00:38:27 --> 00:38:32
It wouldn't really work that alone.
We'd need the acquired and adaptive

480
00:38:32 --> 00:38:37
response which takes a couple of
weeks the first time.

481
00:38:37 --> 00:38:42
And so the humoral response and the
cell-mediated or cellular or

482
00:38:42 --> 00:38:46
cell-based response.
The humoral response has the

483
00:38:46 --> 00:38:51
macrophage that first engulfs the
antigen and the B cell that

484
00:38:51 --> 00:38:56
recognizes the antigen through its
specific tethered on its surface

485
00:38:56 --> 00:39:01
antibodies.  Both of them engulf it,
break it down and present to the

486
00:39:01 --> 00:39:06
helper T cell.
The cell-based response involves

487
00:39:06 --> 00:39:11
killer T cells.
So inside the macrophage and the B

488
00:39:11 --> 00:39:16
cell a lysosome comes over,
it fuses with the endosome, breaks

489
00:39:16 --> 00:39:21
it into epitopes which get loaded on
MHC class II molecules.

490
00:39:21 --> 00:39:26
Inside every nucleated cell in our
body we have a proteasome that is

491
00:39:26 --> 00:39:31
breaking anything that's found in
the cytoplasm onto epitopes.

492
00:39:31 --> 00:39:35
And if the cell is infected those
are going to get broken into

493
00:39:35 --> 00:39:40
epitopes and loaded on MHC-1
molecule to be hunted down by killer

494
00:39:40 --> 00:39:45
T cells.  This is recognized by a T
cell receptor with an accessory

495
00:39:45 --> 00:39:50
protein CD4.  This one's recognized
by a T cell receptor with an

496
00:39:50 --> 00:39:55
accessory protein that's CD8.
See, it's not so hard, right?

497
00:39:55 --> 00:40:00
It seems a little bit wordy, but
conceptually --

498
00:40:00 --> 00:40:04
So the T cell causes the blood,
the B cell to clonally expand.  Some

499
00:40:04 --> 00:40:09
of them become plasma cells which
secrete antibodies.

500
00:40:09 --> 00:40:14
Some of them become long-lived
memory B cells.

501
00:40:14 --> 00:40:19
The killer T cell,
recognizing an infected cell,

502
00:40:19 --> 00:40:24
will secrete perforin to punch holes
in it, granzyme B to kill

503
00:40:24 --> 00:40:30
it through apoptosis.
And it also creates lines of memory

504
00:40:30 --> 00:40:36
killer T cells such that the next
time we see the same pathogen,

505
00:40:36 --> 00:40:43
if any, we're ready.  OK.  So, now,
if we didn't have the mechanism to

506
00:40:43 --> 00:40:50
make antibodies or T cell receptors,
what if we only had the innate

507
00:40:50 --> 00:40:56
response?  And there are people who
don't have the acquired

508
00:40:56 --> 00:41:02
or adaptive response.
Oh, excuse me.

509
00:41:02 --> 00:41:08
These are other terms.
And they're called the “bubble boy”.

510
00:41:08 --> 00:41:13
Have you heard of the bubble boy?
They have to live inside a bubble,

511
00:41:13 --> 00:41:19
basically a plastic shell that's
completely sterile.

512
00:41:19 --> 00:41:24
They either don't have B or T cells
or they don't have any antibody or T

513
00:41:24 --> 00:41:30
cell variation.
And so the innate response is not

514
00:41:30 --> 00:41:35
quite good enough.
And so, on the other hand,

515
00:41:35 --> 00:41:40
sometimes you can have an overactive
immune response.

516
00:41:40 --> 00:41:46
For instance, you could have killer
T cells or even antibodies that

517
00:41:46 --> 00:41:51
recognize or start to recognize host
proteins.  And this happens.

518
00:41:51 --> 00:41:57
And the end result of this is
autoimmune disease.

519
00:41:57 --> 00:42:02
So here's an example of an
autoimmune disease that's caused by

520
00:42:02 --> 00:42:07
killer T cells that have now started
to recognize beta cells in the

521
00:42:07 --> 00:42:13
pancreas as being infected and they
kill them.  And the beta cells in

522
00:42:13 --> 00:42:18
the pancreas are cells that respond
to levels of glucose in your blood.

523
00:42:18 --> 00:42:24
So you have like a candy bar, you
eat a meal, there are high levels of

524
00:42:24 --> 00:42:29
glucose in your blood.
The beta cells secrete insulin so

525
00:42:29 --> 00:42:33
that your entire body,
the cells in your body will make

526
00:42:33 --> 00:42:38
glucose receptors to take that
glucose out of the blood and utilize

527
00:42:38 --> 00:42:42
it.  So if you don't have beta cells
because they've been killed by the

528
00:42:42 --> 00:42:47
killer T cells you don't make
insulin and you get diabetes.

529
00:42:47 --> 00:42:51
Let's see.  What other autoimmune
diseases?  Lupus is an

530
00:42:51 --> 00:42:56
autoimmune disease.
Sometimes you can have antibodies

531
00:42:56 --> 00:43:02
that recognize the myelin sheath,
the cells that make up the myelin

532
00:43:02 --> 00:43:08
sheath, and then those cells are
destroyed.  And that results in

533
00:43:08 --> 00:43:13
multiple sclerosis.
So these are autoimmune diseases,

534
00:43:13 --> 00:43:19
when the immune system goes wild or
goes bad.  OK.

535
00:43:19 --> 00:43:25
So I've just sort of built up the
immune system as being really great

536
00:43:25 --> 00:43:30
and wonderful.
But some of you might have questions

537
00:43:30 --> 00:43:35
and some of you are thinking,
well, you know, gee, I've had the

538
00:43:35 --> 00:43:40
flu twice.  My roommate has had
strep throat a couple of times.

539
00:43:40 --> 00:43:45
What gives?  What's with this
secondary response,

540
00:43:45 --> 00:43:50
this acquired response?
Well, pathogens, some pathogens,

541
00:43:50 --> 00:43:55
it's an ongoing war, have developed
strategies to overcome our immune

542
00:43:55 --> 00:44:01
system.  And that's why we use
antibiotics to kill them sometimes.

543
00:44:01 --> 00:44:05
OK?  And they're nasty,
you know, and they grow fast and

544
00:44:05 --> 00:44:09
they mutate.  And they can develop
ways of getting around our immune

545
00:44:09 --> 00:44:13
system.  For instance,
this is a picture of Bacillus

546
00:44:13 --> 00:44:17
anthracis.  It has developed this
enormous polysaccharide capsule that

547
00:44:17 --> 00:44:21
absolutely prevents it from being
phagocytosed by macrophages.

548
00:44:21 --> 00:44:25
Without the capsule it is
absolutely harmless.

549
00:44:25 --> 00:44:29
It absolutely requires the capsule
to cause disease, as

550
00:44:29 --> 00:44:34
well as a toxin.
That's the only thing it needs,

551
00:44:34 --> 00:44:40
a toxin that is on a plasmid and in
a capsule.  Or,

552
00:44:40 --> 00:44:46
let's say we develop antibodies to
neisseria gonorrhea,

553
00:44:46 --> 00:44:51
or we develop antibodies to malaria.
What they do, these pathogens, some

554
00:44:51 --> 00:44:57
of them very clever ones,
is they say OK, antibodies are

555
00:44:57 --> 00:45:02
recognizing things on my surface.
I know.  I'll just change my surface.

556
00:45:02 --> 00:45:06
And they'll change their surface.
They'll put up a different protein

557
00:45:06 --> 00:45:10
for phase variation or they'll
mutate.  And the antibodies are so

558
00:45:10 --> 00:45:15
specific that they cannot recognize
this mutated protein,

559
00:45:15 --> 00:45:19
and it's like we're getting it again
for the first time.

560
00:45:19 --> 00:45:24
And this actually happens with
cholera.

561
00:45:24 --> 00:45:29
So in places where it's endemic,
people get it once, they develop

562
00:45:29 --> 00:45:34
long-term resistance,
and then 20 to 40 years suddenly

563
00:45:34 --> 00:45:39
adults start getting cholera again.
Actually, I'm not even sure it

564
00:45:39 --> 00:45:44
happens that quickly.
The last one happened in the late

565
00:45:44 --> 00:45:49
1990s where it just started wiping
out adults.  And so whole clinics

566
00:45:49 --> 00:45:55
had to be developed in town squares
for oral rehydration.

567
00:45:55 --> 00:46:00
And what had happened was that the
bacterium, the vibrio cholerae

568
00:46:00 --> 00:46:06
bacterium changed one sugar residue
on its surface.

569
00:46:06 --> 00:46:11
Just one little sugar changes.
A fructose turned into a mannose,

570
00:46:11 --> 00:46:17
right?  And that was it, because
that was what the antibody

571
00:46:17 --> 00:46:22
recognized.  So now new antibodies
have to be made to that one so

572
00:46:22 --> 00:46:28
people will get it twice.
There are some bacteria that make

573
00:46:28 --> 00:46:34
proteases that are designed to cut
our antibodies in half.

574
00:46:34 --> 00:46:39
So horrible.  So they just go in
there and they just secrete these

575
00:46:39 --> 00:46:44
proteases, and the antibodies have
just like degraded.

576
00:46:44 --> 00:46:49
Let's see.  Some pathogens can
survive phagocytosis.

577
00:46:49 --> 00:46:54
They send out little messages that
prevent the lysosome from coming

578
00:46:54 --> 00:47:00
over, and they live
in the phagosome.

579
00:47:00 --> 00:47:03
And, oh, I'm going to be leaving you
on a sad note,

580
00:47:03 --> 00:47:07
ha?  But, all right,
do we have any questions?

581
00:47:07 --> 00:47:15
Do we have any questions?

582
00:47:15 --> 00:47:18
No?  Perfectly clear?
OK.  You can go.
