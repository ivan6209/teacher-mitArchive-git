7.013 Introductory Biology, Spring 2006 
Transcript – Lecture 36 

So this lecture is called the future of biology.  And I want to associate somewhat 
freely.  I'm not going to write on the board.  I am going to post this presentation 
so you can pull down stuff from it. 

And I think there are two basic threads where we're going in biology.  One of 
them is a basic understanding, what don't we know about biology?  And the 
second is how are we going to use that information to go somewhere profound in 
the future?  So the first one is how life works.  And the obvious place to start is 
the Human Genome Project. 

The Human Genome Project was a very bold initiative that was first spoken 
about in the late 1980s.  And I remember being at some of the first 
conversations.  I was at the time finishing off my graduate work.  I remember 
being at some of the first conversations about the Human Genome Project where 
the goal was to sequence the human genome, identify all the genes and DNA, 
and then use them to do a bunch of things that I'll talk about in a moment.  And at 
the time, I have to say, it seemed like a really stupid idea. 

It was very difficult to determine the sequence of DNA.  It took hours and days 
and days to read even a thousand base pairs.  And, as you know, we have more 
than ten to the ninth base pairs.  So the notion of sequencing the entire human 
genome seemed incredibly expensive and incredibly stupid.  But that was a 
reflection, I think, of my naivety.  And, in fact, it's been a very useful exercise. 
Sequencing has gotten better, largely because it had to in order for this project to 
succeed. 

And I think there's a real lesson there.  If something has to happen, if you have to 
get a project done, there are people, you guys, who can make techniques better 
and get things done.  So DNA sequencing is much, much orders of magnitude 
faster than it was ten years ago.  And, in fact, this project was initiated in 1990. 
The sequencing, per se, was completed a couple of years ago.  But, still, there 
are many people who are looking at the sequence and trying to figure out what it 
means. 

Because, as you remember from everything we've talked about, DNA sequence 
is a code.  And even if you get three times ten to the ninth base pairs of the 
human genome, all you've gotten is a code.  And now you have to crack the 
code.  And we know how to crack the code kind of, that's what we've been talking 

about over and over.  What does a promoter look like?  What does an RNA look 
like?  What does a coding region look like? 

What are the signals in a coding region that tells a protein synthesis to begin and 
to end?  But when you've just given the, when you're given this huge mass of 
information that contains maybe 5% genes and 95% other stuff, to actually find 
the genes in the human genome from all the sequence data is not trivial.  And so 
there is still analysis going on trying to figure out the identity of a bunch of genes 
and indeed the gene number. 

And you may notice every now and then revised estimates for gene numbers in 
the human genome, and it hovers somewhere around 20,000 to 30,000.  Before 
the sequence was obtained, it was thought that there were at least 100,000 
distinct genes in the genome.  The number came down and down and down. 
And now we think they're somewhere around 25,000 genes.  That's the latest 
estimate.  It doesn't really matter.  Give or take a few thousand. 

But still the Human Genome Project is not complete.  But it's complete enough 
that many people, including Professor Lander who is here at MIT who is over at 
the Broad Institute that's being built across Main Street.  If you guys walk up 
towards the Stata Center and look across Main Street, there's a new building 
going up.  That is the Broad Institute that is being organized by Professor Lander 
who was instrumental, one of the pivotal people in sequencing the human 
genome. 

And he and others are now doing the takeoff from the Human Genome Project, 
and it goes like this.  Basically describe everything else about molecular biology. 
And it's a daunting list of what people want to do.  Find all the RNAs, all the 
proteins in every cell type at every time during a cell's life. 

Figure out all the DNA-protein interactions, so all the transcription factors that 
bind to DNA.  Figure out all the proteins that bind to RNA and might regulate their 
translation or might regulate their stability.  Figure out all the protein-protein 
interactions, all those enzyme complexes, all those proteins that interact in all 
those signal transduction cascades you've been talking about. 

We have no idea what all the protein-protein interactions that go on in every cell 
at every point in a cell's life are.  All the signal transduction events.  All the 
regulatory circuits.  I'll talk more about that in a moment.  All gene function.  All 
diseased genes.  This is an enormous list.  It's going to take decades of many 
people to get through this list and get all this information.  And, of course, in the 
end this is just information. 

And you have to do something with it and put it together so that you do land up 
with understanding gene function and being able to build circuits of the kind that 
bioengineers like to do.  One thing I want to point out for those of you who are 

interested in computer science.  One of the things that has come out of the 
Human Genome Project is a lot of data, but it's actually not that much data.  It's a 
few terabytes.  OK?  So 80,000 CDs will store all the information coming from the 
Human Genome Project. 

But that's just DNA sequence.  OK?  If you're starting to look at protein-protein 
interaction, all the RNAs, everything that I just went through on that list, we're 
talking about billions and billions and probably trillions of terabytes.  Where is that 
information going to go?  Is there a good way to store the information now? 
There probably ought to be some real reevaluation of data storage.  And there is. 
There is some interesting work being done to try to figure out how to store and 
how to access the information that's going to come out of the follow-up of the 
Human Genome Project. 

How do you find proteins that are present in all cells at different times in a cell 
life?  So here's a piece of real data.  In the study of proteomics the notion is to 
look for proteins that are present in one cell type and not in another cell type. 
This is a technique that you know, gel electrophoresis.  It's called 2-dimensional 
gel electrophoresis. 

In the first dimension you separate proteins by charge.  And then you actually 
turn your gel around, rerun it and separate proteins according to their size.  And 
what you get are a constellation of spots, each of which represents a protein. 
And you can look at the spectrum of proteins from one cell type and from another 
cell type and ask what's different and what's similar between the two cell types. 

So, for example, this arrow up here.  Actually, let's look at this one.  In this cell 
type one there's one, two, three spots that are in the circle and an arrow pointing 
to nothing.  If you look at cell type two, here are one, two, three, the same spots. 
And here one, two, three.  And here the arrow is pointing to another spot which is 
a protein that's present in cell type two and not cell type one.  And this kind of 
method is the way that people are figuring out which proteins are present in 
which cell type. 

What you can do now is to actually cut this little spot out of the gel of cell type 
two, put it through the mass spec and figure out the identify of that protein.  So 
you can do this stuff.  It's just a lot of work.  And there are more sophisticated 
methods than this to go about finding all the proteins, but basically you have to 
look and you have to identify the protein.  And then you have to store that data 
and use it somehow. 

Here's something else that's being done by Professor Young at MIT.  Professor 
Young is trying to figure out all the regulatory networks between all the genes in 
yeast.  So yeast is a small organism.  It has just a few thousand genes.  And it 
has actually just a few hundred transcription factors.  And their names are 
arrayed around the outside of the circle. 

And what he's done, using various techniques, is to figure out which transcription 
factor activates the expression or changes the activity of which other transcription 
factor.  And so every arrow indicates that there is some kind of interaction 
between these different transcription factors.  And this gives a kind of regulatory 
network of the circuitry involved in controlling yeast transcription. 

Now, yeast is a single cell with very few genes.  We are, as you know, 
multicellular organisms with many genes.  And so the regulatory maps for 
humans are going to look many, many orders of magnitude more complex than 
this one.  That's where we're going.  And part of going there is using 
computational biology.  One of the things that there is focus on in a number of 
departments at MIT, including Course 7.0, is the question of computational 
biology or that include systems biology. 

And how can you use computational methods to work together with real data to 
predict these circuits, to describe these very, very complex circuits, to describe 
the circuit of life?  And I can tell you something.  It sounds as though it's a doable 
task, and in theory it is, but actually we are not able to describe the circuit of life 
for even the simple viruses. 

So there is a virus called phage Lambda that's been mentioned to you.  It has 
been studied for many, many, many decades.  And we know about its lifecycle in 
great detail.  It doesn't have that many genes.  We know which genes turn on 
and off.  And yet we still don't have a completely reliable computer model of how 
this phage responds to various environmental inputs. 

We don't quite know when it's going to lyse the cell or when it's going to 
incorporate into the bacterial cell chromosome.  We don't even have a complete 
computational description for a simple virus.  So to get it for a cell is a daunting 
task.  And this is where computational biology is going to have to work with the 
real data and where you guys come in to try to bring things together so we can 
actually get reasonable equations of life. 

Here's an equation that I took from one of my colleagues, Professor Eric 
Davidson who is at Caltech, who has been working with someone else to look at 
one of the regulatory circuits in drosophila.  And again this is just the tip of the 
iceberg of gene interactions.  You can look at this on the PowerPoint later. 
These are gene interactions, and this is just a little bit of the circuitry that sets up 
a little bit of the body plan in the fruit fly drosophila.  Here's another frontier of 
biology.  Imaging. 

Imaging in biology is fantastic right now.  So we can do stuff like look at fish that 
has got its red blood cells fluorescently labeled.  And we can actually see in real-
time the movement of the red blood cells through the different parts of the body. 
We can put various drugs on the fish.  We can use various fish mutants that are 

defective in components of the extracellular matrix, for example, or some other 
aspect of the animal that might control red blood cell movement or function. 

And we can look in real-time at what happens to the animal.  This works great in 
fish, but it's only the beginning because there are things we still cannot see 
clearly enough, even in fish which are transparent.  So these methods work well. 
The challenges become very great in mammals where development occurs 
inside the mother and where the animal is opaque.  And how do you actually 
follow single cells through the animal as they're doing whatever they're doing? 

So, for example, if one wants to know what happens to a cancer cell when it's 
introduced into an animal, does it go directly to the place where it's going to make 
a tumor or does it wander around the body until it actually finds where it's going? 
You have to be able to image single cells in a very profound way.  And this is one 
of the current frontiers of biology.  But then you can go deeper down into the cell. 
You can expand that by a few orders of magnitude and say, well, it's not just 
looking at the outside of the cell. 

You really want to be looking inside the cell in real-time to see proteins 
interacting, to see transcription happening in real-time in the cell.  It's not quite 
clear how to do that right now.  It's a combination of physics.  So if you're thinking 
of a Course 8.0 major, this is something you might think about.  It's a combination 
of physics and biology.  How do you get imaging on a resolution high enough that 
you can look in real-time at these events that are occurring in a cell? 

Fascinating problem.  Neurobiology we touched on.  Where is neurobiology 
going?  Well, lots of places.  How do you make the brain?  We have no idea how 
you construct the 3-dimensional brain.  And we don't understand the significance 
of the 3-dimensional structure of the brain.  In neurobiology we talked about the 
circuitry in the brain and about the billions and billions of circuits that there are in 
the brain, probably ten to the fifteenth circuits within the brain itself. 

How on earth are we going to actually figure out that circuitry?  I have no idea.  I 
have no idea what we can do in the mammalian brain.  We cannot even do it 
properly in something fairly simple like the fruit fly, so how are we going to do it in 
the human brain?  This is a real frontier of biology that, again, brings together 
multiple disciplines; physics, biology, brain and cognitive science. 

What's the molecular basis for thought and how can we think about ourselves 
thinking about ourselves thinking about ourselves?  What does that mean?  OK? 
You've had one test on action potentials.  You know about synapses.  It's got 
something to do with channels and synapses, right?  But what goes beyond 
there?  How does it come back to something that allows us to think in such 
complex ways?  Here's one.  Why do we sleep? 

Simple question.  We sleep.  You have to sleep.  If you don't sleep, this is 
something for you guys to bear in mind.  If you don't sleep, after two weeks you 
will drop dead.  That is true of rats.  If you prevent a rat sleeping for two weeks it 
drops dead.  There is something that happens during sleep, and it's not clear 
what, it's really not clear what.  It's thought that it might be some kind of 
metabolic restoration of the brain that maybe you run out of some essential 
components that you need in order to get normal circuitry. 

But you literally have to sleep or you will die.  But we don't know why.  OK?  So 
that's a frontier that is particularly interesting.  OK.  This is work I wanted to show 
you from my own laboratory.  We're interested in the 3-dimensional structure of 
the brain and why you have a 3-dimensional structure and how you make the 3-
dimensional structure.  We're looking in the zebra fish.  This is a normal zebra 
fish brain.  And you can see it's got these three red regions, which are actually 
cavities in the brain. 

And then this is a whole series of mutant fish we've isolated that have got really 
messed up brains.  They turn out to be really messed up animals.  They've got 
abnormal behavior, their neurons grow in the wrong place, and there's something 
profoundly wrong with both the architecture of the brain and the function of the 
brain.  This is one kind of approach we can take but, in fact this is asking a rather 
simple question.  It's not asking the question of how the zebra fish thinks about 
itself, if it does. 

OK.  Oh, so what I'd like to do in the last lecture also is to point you in the 
direction of relevant movies, some of which you'll have heard of and some of 
which you won't.  This is one you've probably heard of because it's a new one. 
So I particularly liked this movie with respect to neurobiology because, actually, I 
didn't like this movie.  I thought it was a really depressing movie, but the part that 
I thought was really relevant to this class is that there is a company called 
Lacuna Incorporated that will go in and selectively erase memories from your 
memory banks. 

And they actually can plug in, you know, they put a thing on your head with 
electrodes coming out.  And then they have a TV monitor.  And they can actually 
see the circuits that correspond to a particular memory.  And then they hit the 
erase button or the delete button and that memory goes.  And this movie is about 
this guy, you look in so pain, Dr. Gardel. 

This movie is about this guy, Jim Carey, who is trying not to be erased.  Anyway, 
it's very interesting because I thought, gee, will there ever come a time when we 
actually can have a TV screen and we actually can see the circuits that 
correspond to a particular memory?  So see it if for no other reason.  OK, here 
we go, basic understanding.  Something we have not talked much about in this 
course but is really very important with regard to the future of biology is evolution. 

What does evolution mean, especially in molecular terms?  And I actually wanted 
to throw this out at you because this is in the news presently, this term "intelligent 
design" and the contrast to evolution.  I think that you guys, even now but 
certainly as you develop and go through MIT, really become spokespeople for 
science and become commentators on current issues in science.  And I think you 
really should be aware of some current issues, so I'm throwing this out at your to 
increase your awareness. 

There is a term floating around called "intelligent design" which is sort of, I would 
say, an extension of creationism where the sense is that things are just so 
complex and so interesting and seem to be so well designed that how could this 
have happened by the process of evolution?  And so if you look in the news, if 
you do a Google news or if you just look in the newspapers, you'll see there are 
raging controversies about the notion of intelligent design versus evolution 
around the country. 

And indeed evolution is complex, and we cannot explain how everything occurs. 
This is a picture of Darwin's finches, the thing that got him thinking about 
evolution.  These finches that live in the Galapagos Islands and are believed to 
have arisen from a single pair of finches that the wind blew astray about 100,000 
years ago.  And that turned into a bunch of different species that can be picked 
out by their head shape and their beak size. 

And it's really not clear how you actually got this set of different beak shapes and 
head size.  The sense of selection for particular beaks that allowed the birds to 
eat particular foods and so on is a very compelling one.  And there certainly is no 
doubt in my mind, or I would say in most people's mind who work in biology, that 
natural selection and evolution is the way to go. 

But I want to raise with you an interesting question and then I want to tell you 
about a new paper that I read concerning natural selection.  So natural selection 
leading to evolution is thought to act on three different kinds of changes in DNA. 
Single based mutations, you remember those, frame shifts, missense, nonsense 
mutations and so on. 

Cis-regulatory mutations, those refer to mutations in the promoter regions of 
genes.  So those would change the transcription of a gene.  A single base 
mutation would change whether a protein is made and what the actual sequence 
of the protein is and therefore its potential function.  The cis-regulatory mutations 
would change how much of a message was made, how much of a protein was 
made. 

And here's one that you've touched on a bit, but I want to touch on a bit more, 
which is the repeat number of motifs within one coding sequence.  So what am I 
talking about?  Well, I'll tell you what I'm talking about.  And I'll use it to describe 
the example of dog evolution.  So dogs are really different from one another. 

They're extraordinarily different from one another.  If you look at their size and 
their actual faces and the bones of their face, the shapes of the bones, the size 
of the snout and so on are really different. 

You know, not only are they cute, but they're really different from one another. 
OK.  And if you actually look, over the past 150 years, there has been a huge 
increase in the number of breeds and a huge increase in the changes that you 
see in dog facial skeleton.  Now, this bothers people who think about evolution. 

Because if you look at the number of single based mutations that are around in 
coding sequences, it would not seem to be enough to accomplish these rapid 
changes in dog morphology.  And so a very interesting paper came out last year 
that will lead to a conclusion I'll tell you a moment.  The conclusion has to do with 
variations in the number of motif repeats within a protein. 

So what am I talking about?  So forget this.  This is actually on your handout.  So 
if you look at, I did give you a handout and I haven't been referring to it, but this in 
fact is number seven on your handout.  So if you look at protein A and allele A of 
protein A or allele B of protein A, they may differ in the following way.  In protein 
A there may be a small amino acid stretch that is repeated a couple of times. 

It could be directly contiguous or it could be a little far apart from each other.  And 
then if you look at allele B of protein A, you might have five copies of that repeat 
sequence.  And, in fact, that change in number of copies of a particular part of a 
protein can profoundly change the function of the protein.  It can change 
confirmation.  It can change enzymatic activity.  It can change localization in the 
cell.  It can change stability of the protein and so on. 

These repeats and variation in the number of repeats are actually very easy to 
get.  They are about 100,000 times more frequent than point mutations if you 
look in genomes.  And they occur during recombination where the DNA 
sequences might misalign with one another.  And I'm not going to get into this 
now, but if you want to come ask me later I'll email you.  We can go into this 
more. 

But they occur because the DNA sequences don't quite align properly during 
recombination, and you get the protein changing a bit with respect to these 
repeat sequences.  And so Fondon and Garner looked at 92 breeds of dogs, and 
they looked in 17 genes that they thought might important in shaping the facial 
skeleton because we know what those genes are.  And they found, very 
interestingly, that these 17 genes had 37 repeat regions amongst them which is 
actually much higher than you find in just your general spread of genes. 

And when they looked from breed to breed they found there was a huge variation 
in the numbers of repeats in different genes from one breed of dog to another 
breed of dog.  Now, I don't know really what this means.  It's very interesting 

potentially for looking at how breeds of dogs have evolved or how we have 
forced their evolution. 

Does this have something to do profoundly with evolution and changes in form in 
general?  Don't know that.  But it's something that you should be aware of as you 
go on because it's a slightly different way to think about how rapid evolution can 
occur.  OK.  Clinical understanding.  Disease taxonomy, you've talked a bit about 
this in cancer.  Over the last few decades there has been an enormous increase 
in the number of genes that can be assigned to be associated with a particular 
disease. 

And my chart here only goes up to 2002.  It would probably be somewhere out 
here on the roof for 2005.  How do you do this?  Well, this is where the Humane 
Genome Project comes in.  One can look.  And each of these squares represents 
a gene and its expression, and the level of expression is proportional to the color 
or is associated with the color.  It doesn't matter which.  But you can look in 
different cancers. 

And each of these lines is a cancer.  And you can look at different genes.  And 
you can see that different tumors have got different patterns of gene expression. 
And you can use those patterns of gene expression to classify the tumors.  And 
this has been done by Professor Lander and Dr. Golub over at the Genome 
Center.  So, for example, in acute lymphocytic leukemia, you can see one pattern 
of gene expression.  Again, each of these squares represents a gene and the 
color represents the level of expression of the gene. 

And you can see in acute myelogenous leukemia there's a completely different 
pattern of expression.  This is fantastic because it starts to allow you to classify a 
disease in molecular detail.  The old way of pathologists looking at diseases, 
looking at cells and trying to classify both cancers and other disorders on the 
basis of morphology of cells and of staining of cells is actually not that precise. 
It's much better than nothing. 

But being able to do it at a molecular level really lets you know what disease 
you're dealing with and what spectrum of drugs might be appropriate to treat that 
disorder.  And so that segues nicely into the future of prediction.  What can we 
predict in biology?  So here are a couple.  Will your specific disorder respond to 
particular drugs?  If you have acute Lymphocytic leukemia, will it respond to a 
particular spectrum of drugs? 

And if you have a particular variant of acute Lymphocytic leukemia, will it respond 
to particular variants of drugs?  We're already on the cusp of classifying cancers 
in a way that you can give a particular spectrum of drugs for a particular kind of 
cancer.  And this is really going to escalate to everything.  There is almost no 
disorder that is treatable by medication that where different people are not 
sensitive at different levels to a particular medication. 

So some people might respond very well and some people might respond very 
poorly, not just in cancer but in almost all disorders.  In the future, and I think it's 
going to be in the near future, really in the next few years, I think it's going to be 
possible to say what specific disorder do you have and should you be taking this 
particular combination of drugs?  And here's another one.  Are you genetically 
predetermined to get a specific disease? 

That's a really tough one.  Maybe you want to know.  Maybe you don't want to 
know.  We'll come to that to in a moment.  Here's a movie that I particularly liked 
that has to do with predicting who you're going to be and what you're going to get 
or not get.  And it's called Gattaca.  You guys may or may not have seen it, or 
used to see it long ago.  Have you guys seen Gattaca?  Yes.  OK.  Good.  Fine. 
I'm not that far out.  I was trying to gauge your level here. 

I liked that.  I particularly liked ìthere is no gene for the human spiritî.  So Gattaca 
falls into the prediction aegis quite well.  I next few years, and I would say within 
ten years easy, you are going to be about to get your personal DNA profile, 
including information about the approximately 1,000 bad alleles of genes that we 
all carry.  So that's good, I guess. 

And that's bad.  Do you want this information?  Do you want to know what you're 
going to get?  Do you want to know that you're going to get a neurological 
disease as you get older?  Do you want to know that you're likely to have a heart 
attack before you're 50?  Do you want others to have this information?  Would 
you like your perspective partner to know that you're likely to get some horrible 
neurological disease?  Would you like your insurance company to know this? 
Would you like your children to know it?  I don't know.  I don't know what the 
answer is. 

Myself, I prefer actually not to know and to go through life day-to-day having as 
good a time as I can and letting whatever, God or chance take care of the rest. 
But there is certainly merit in trying to prevent some things.  And this is really 
going to be a reality very soon.  Already, actually, you can get for your dog a 
DNA profile that's actually fairly detailed. 

It is RFLP mapping that we talked about in class where you can make sure that 
your dog is who you think it is and who its parents are and who it thinks it is.  So 
you can get your own in the future.  I don't know what they're going to call the 
American Kennel Club equivalent for humans, but you'll be able to get your 
certificate of DNA analysis.  OK.  Design.  We talked long ago about rational drug 
design. 

And Gleevec is really one of the shinning examples of being able to look at the 
structure of a protein and saying, hey, this protein is a bad protein, it's an 
abnormal protein, and it's causative of leukemia.  And wouldn't it be great to 

inhibit its function?  And so let's design the screen molecule which looks as 
though it will inhibit ATP binding and prevent this kinase from acting.  And, in 
fact, Gleevec works really well that way.  And this is something that is being, this 
approach is being very, very actively pursued, and will only be more actively 
pursued. 

And if you're thinking of a Course 5.0 major or if you're thinking of many of the 
engineering majors, you may well get into rational drug design and figuring out 
how to get it to work.  Here's another one, prediction for the future and Jurassic 
Park.  Xenotransplantation, using pigs that have immune systems engineered to 
look like the human immune system for organ transplants.  There are companies 
trying to do this. 

Bionics.  Here is something for all of you interested in mechanical engineering 
and other, bionics.  Robocop.  Here's a movie to see if you haven't.  Artificial 
hearts.  Artificial hearts are a disaster presently.  AbioCor has a heart now that is 
fully implantable and that will take over ventricular function, but it is a lousy heart. 
And if one of you could go and make a new heart that actually would work 
properly that would be a real service to humankind. 

Blood substitutes.  We still do not have a blood substitute that really works. 
There is one patented.  It's called Oxygent.  It's a perfluorocarbon that will carry 
oxygen around the blood in the body for a while, but it's not very good.  And 
finally aging.  Here's a movie you probably haven't heard of, Zardoz.  Zardoz, a 
great movie about a community where nobody aged and they were really, really 
unhappy. 

And then Sean Connery comes along and introduces this community that doesn't 
age and doesn't have sex and is just generally miserable to the joys of 
procreation.  And they go for it.  And then they age and they die happily ever 
after.  So that's OK.  And if you're looking for a summer book to read, Professor 
Guarente at MIT has written a great book about aging, which is what his research 
focuses on.  And you might want to look at that. 

So the challenge I give to you is where are you going to come in?  I wish you all 
the best of luck.  And it's been a pleasure to teach you.  [APPLAUSE]
