A Message   to  Garcia

Elbert  Hubbard

1899


In  all  this  Cuban  business  there  is  one  man  stands  out  on  the  horizon  of  my   memory  like  Mars 
at  perihelion. 
When  war  broke  out  between  Spain  and  the  United  States,  it  was   very  necessary  to  com­
municate  quickly  with  the  leader  of  the  Insurgents.   Garcia   was   somewhere  in  the  mountain 
fastnesses  of  Cuba  - no  one  knew  where.  No  mail   or  telegraph  could  reach  him.  The  President 
must  secure  his  co-operation,  and  quickly. 
What  to  do! 
Someone  said  to  the  President,  “There’s   a  fellow  by  the  name  of  Rowan  will  ﬁnd  Garcia  
for  you,  if  anybody  can.” 
Rowan  was  sent  for  and  given   a  letter   to  be  delivered   to  Garcia.  How  “the  fellow  by 
name  of  Rowan”  took  the  letter,  sealed  it  up  in  an  oil-skin  pouch,  strapped  it  over   his   heart, 
in  four  days  landed  by  night  off  the  coast  of  Cuba   from   an  open  boat,   disappeared  into  the 
jungle,  and  in  three  weeks  came  out  on  the  other  side  of  the  island,  having   traversed  a  hostile 
country  on  foot,  and  having  delivered  his   letter   to  Garcia,  are  things I  have  no  special  desire 
now  to  tell  in  detail.  The  point  I  wish  to  make  is   this:  McKinley  gave  Rowan  a  letter   to  be 
delivered  to  Garcia;  Rowan  took  the  letter   and  did  not  ask,  “Where  is   he  at?” 
By  the  Eternal!  There  is  a  man  whose  form   should  be  cast  in  deathless  bronze  and 
the  statue  placed  in  every  college  in  the  land.  It  is   not  book-learning  young   men  need,  nor 
instruction  about  this  or  that,  but  a  stiffening  of  the  vertebrae  which  will  cause  them  to  be 
loyal  to  a  trust,  to  act  promptly,  concentrate  their   energies;   do  the  thing   - “carry   a  message 
to  Garcia!” 
General  Garcia  is  dead  now,  but  there  are  other  Garcias.   No  man,  who  has   endeavored 
to  carry  out  an  enterprise  where  many  hands   were  needed,  but  has   been  well-nigh  appalled 
at  times  by  the  imbecility  of  the  average  man  - the  inability   or  unwillingness   to  concentrate 
on  a  thing  and  do  it. 
Slipshod  assistance,  foolish  inattention,   dowdy  indifference,  and  half-hearted  work  seem 
the  rule;   and  no  man  succeeds,  unless   by  hook  or  crook,   or  threat,  he  forces   or  bribes  other 
men  to  assist  him;  or  mayhap,  God  in  His  goodness  performs  a  miracle,  and  sends   him   an 
Angel  of  Light  for  an  assistant. 
You,  reader,  put  this  matter  to  a  test:   You  are  sitting   now  in  your   ofﬁce—six  clerks  are 
within  your  call.  Summon  any  one  and  make  this   request:  “Please  look  in  the  encyclopedia 
and  make  a  brief  memorandum  for  me  concerning  the  life  of  Corregio.” 
Will  the  clerk  quietly  say,  “Yes,   sir,”  and  go  do  the  task? 
On  your  life,  he  will  not.  He  will   look  at  you  out  of  a  ﬁshy   eye,   and  ask  one  or  more  of 
the  following  questions: 
Who  was  he? 
Which  encyclopedia? 
Where  is  the  encyclopedia? 
Was I  hired  for  that? 
Don’t  you  mean  Bismarck? 
What’s  the  matter  with  Charlie  doing   it? 
Is  he  dead? 
Is  there  any  hurry? 
Shan’t I  bring  you  the  book  and  let  you  look  it  up  yourself? 
What  do  you  want  to  know  for? 
And I  will  lay  you  ten  to  one  that  after   you  have  answered  the  questions,   and  explained 
how  to  ﬁnd  the  information,  and  why  you  want  it,   the  clerk  will  go  off  and  get  one  of  the 

2 

other  clerks  to  help  him  ﬁnd  Garcia  - and  then  come  back  and  tell   you  there  is   no  such  man. 
Of  course  I  may  lose  my  bet,  but  according  to  the  Law  of Average, I  will  not. 
Now  if  you  are  wise  you  will  not  bother  to  explain  to  your   “assistant”  that  Corregio  is  
indexed  under  the  C’s,  not  in  the  K’s,   but  you  will  smile  sweetly  and  say,  “Never   mind,”  and 
go  look  it  up  yourself.  And  this  incapacity  for  independent  action,  this   moral   stupidity,  this  
inﬁrmity  of  the  will,  this  unwillingness  to  cheerfully  catch  hold  and  lift,  are  the  things  that 
put  pure  socialism  so  far  into  the  future.  If  men  will  not  act  for  themselves,  what  will  they  do 
when  the  beneﬁt  of  their  effort  is  for   all? 
A  ﬁrst  mate  with  knotted  club  seems   necessary;  and  the  dread  of  getting  “the  bounce” 
Saturday  night  holds  many  a  worker  in  his   place. 
Advertise  for  a  stenographer,  and  nine  times  out  of  ten  who  apply  can  neither   spell  nor 
punctuate  - and  do  not  think  it  necessary  to. 
Can  such  a  one  write  a  letter  to  Garcia? 
“You  see  that  bookkeeper,”  said  the  foreman  to  me  in  a  large  factory. 
“Yes,  what  about  him?” 
“Well,  he’s  a  ﬁne  accountant,  but  if  I’d  send  him   to  town  on  an  errand,   he  might  accom­
plish  the  errand  all  right,  and,  on  the  other  hand,   might  stop  at  four  saloons   on  the  way,  and 
when  he  got  to  Main  Street,  would  forget  what  he  had  been  sent  for.” 
Can  such  a  man  be  entrusted  to  carry   a  message  to  Garcia? 
We  have  recently  been  hearing  much  maudlin   sympathy   expressed  for  the  “down-trodden 
denizen  of  the  sweat  shop”  and  the  “homeless  wanderer   searching  for  honest  employment,” 
and  with  it  all  often  go  many  hard  words   for  the  men  in  power. 
Nothing  is  said  about  the  employer   who  grows  old  before  his   time  in  a  vain  attempt  to 
get  frowsy  ne’er-do-wells  to  do  intelligent  work;   and  his   long   patient  striving  with  “help”  that 
does  nothing  but  loaf  when  his  back  is   turned.   In  every  store  and  factory  there  is   a  constant 
weeding-out  process  going  on.  The  employer  is   constantly  sending  away  “help”  that  have 
shown  their  incapacity  to  further  the  interests  of  the  business,  and  others   are  being   taken  on. 
No  matter  how  good  times  are,   this  sorting   continues,  only   if  times   are  hard  and  work  is  
scarce,  this  sorting  is  done  ﬁner  - but  out  and  forever  out,  the  incompetent  and  unworthy  go.  
It  is  the  survival  of  the  ﬁttest.  self-interest  prompts   every  employer  to  keep  the  best-those  who 
can  carry  a  message  to  Garcia. 
I  know  one  man  of  really  brilliant  parts  who  has   not  the  ability  to  manage  a  business  
of  his  own,  and  yet  who  is  absolutely  worthless   to  anyone  else,  because  he  carries  with  him  
constantly  the  insane  suspicion  that  his   employer  is   oppressing,   or  intending  to  oppress,   him. 
He  can  not  give  orders,  and  he  will  not  receive  them.   Should  a  message  be  given  him   to  take 
to  Garcia,  his  answer  would  probably  be,  “Take  it  yourself.” 
Tonight  this  man  walks  the  streets   looking  for  work,   the  wind  whistling  through  his  
threadbare  coat.  No  one  who  knows  him   dare  employ  him,  for  he  is   a  regular  ﬁrebrand  of 
discontent.  He  is  impervious  to  reason,  and  the  only   thing   that  can  impress   him   is   the  toe  of 
a  thick-soled  No.  9  boot. 
Of  course  I  know  that  one  so  morally   deformed  is   no  less  to  be  pitied  than  a  physical 
cripple;  but  in  your  pitying,  let  us  drop  a  tear,  too,  for  the  men  who  are  striving  to  carry  
on  a  great  enterprise,   whose  working  hours   are  not  limited  by  the  whistle,   and  whose  hair 
is  fast  turning  white  through  the  struggle  to  hold  the  line  in  dowdy  indifference,  slipshod 
imbecility,  and  the  heartless  ingratitude  which,   but  for  their   enterprise,   would  be  both  hungry 
and  homeless. 
Have  I  put  the  matter  too  strongly?  Possibly  I  have;  but  when  all  the  world  has   gone 
a-slumming  I  wish  to  speak  a  word  of  sympathy   for  the  man  who  succeeds  - the  man  who, 
against  great  odds,  has  directed  the  efforts  of  others,  and,   having   succeeded,  ﬁnds  there’s 
nothing  in  it:  nothing  but  bare  board  and  clothes.  I have  carried  a  dinner-pail  and  worked  for 
a  day’s  wages,  and I have  also  been   an  employer  of  labor,  and I know  there  is   something  to  be 
said  on  both  sides.  There  is  no  excellence,   per  se,   in  poverty;   rags   are  no  recommendation;   and 
all  employers  are  not  rapacious  and  high-handed,  any   more  than  all  poor  men  are  virtuous. 

My  heart  goes  out  to  the  man  who  does  his   work  when  the  “boss”  is   away,  as   well   as   when  he 
is  home.  And  the  man  who,  when  given  a  letter   for  Garcia,  quietly  takes   the  missive,   without 
asking  any  idiotic  questions,  and  with  no  lurking   intention   of  chucking  it  into  the  nearest 
sewer,  or  of  doing  aught  else  but  deliver   it,   never   gets   “laid  off,”  nor  has   to  go  on  strike  for 
higher  wages.  Civilization  is  one  long   anxious  search  for  just  such  individuals.  Anything  such 
a  man  asks  will  be  granted;  his  kind  is   so  rare  that  no  employer  can  afford  to  let  him   go.   He 
is  wanted  in  every  city,  town,  and  village  - in  every  ofﬁce,  shop,   store  and  factory.  The  world 
cries  out  for  such;  he  is  needed,  and  needed  badly—the  man  who  can 

Carry  a  message  to  Garcia.
