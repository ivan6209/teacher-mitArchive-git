***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session
***** Course Objectives: *****
On completion of 6.111 students will have confidence in their abilities to
conceive and carry out a complex digital systems design project in a team of
two or three people. More broadly, they will be ready to handle substantial,
challenging design problems. In particular, students will be able to:
   1. explain the elements of digital system abstractions such as digital
      logic, Boolean algebra, flip-flops, finite-state machines (FSMs), and
      microprogrammed systems.
   2. design simple digital systems based on these digital abstractions,and the
      "digital paradigm" including discrete, sampled information.
   3. use basic digital tools and devices such as digital oscilloscopes, PALs,
      PROMs and VHDL.
   4. work in a design team that can propose, design, successfully implement,
      and report on a digital circuit design project.
   5. communicate the purpose and results of a design project in written and
      oral presentations.
***** Learning Outcomes *****
Students will be able to:
    * use Boolean Algebra and resulting logic for control and data paths.
    * do simple design with basic digital building blocks such as multiplexors,
      selectors, and shift registers.
    * characterize binary signals in terms of: input levels, output levels,and
      "noise margins", specifically using the TTL specification.
    * Specify digital circuit timing: setup and hold times and logic
      propagation delays.
    * design and implement a simple FSM.
    * design, implement and program a simple microprogrammed sequencer.
    * use component parts, including complex parts, through their
      specifications.
    * use programmable logic parts for implementation of logical component and
      system realizations.
    * use industry standard CAD software that implements VHDL and can be used
      to program devices: for example Cypress' Galaxy and Nova.
    * explain communications "handshaking" paradigms.
    * evaluate a design concept for appropriateness and achievability.
    * organize a design concept into specific parts.
    * debug and test an implementation of a digital design.
    * give oral and written reports on all aspects of a design project.

**** TTL Pinouts/Data ****
The TTL data book is no longer available. Required data and pinouts will be
handed out, available on the web page, and available in the laboratory.
**** Drawing Template ****
All logic diagrams submitted in this subject must be drawn with a template or
on a computer, except for quizzes, where all that is required is that logic
diagrams be legible. For homework and lab preparation, you may use a drawing
template, though it is likely that you will use a computer-based drawing
package. Preferred templates: MIL-STD-806C, in 1/2, 3/8 or 3/4 size, Koh-I-Noor
No. 830544 or equivalent in Rapid Design or Pickett.
***** Conduct of the Subject (minor changes may be made) *****
**** Classes ****
At the beginning of the term, there are three lectures and one recitation
meeting per week. After the second quiz, the lectures and recitations are
discontinued. We will meet you frequently in the laboratory.
**** Problem Sets ****
Five sets will be issued and your solutions will be graded; these are based on
the lectures, text and labs.
**** Laboratory Assignments ****
All laboratory exercises must be completed; these are intended to prepare you
for the term project. In doing these exercises, each student works
individually.
**** Term Project ****
The most important assignment is the Term Project, about which you will receive
more detailed instruction later. In doing this assignment, you will work with
one or, at most, two partners. You should begin finding your partner(s) early
in the term.
**** Quizzes ****
There will be two quizzes during the term, both before Drop Date.
**** Grading Policy ****
Late work will be penalized. Normally, homework will not be accepted after
solutions have been distributed. Lateness of the lab assignments will result in
a 20% per day penalty for work completed 1-5 working days after the due date.
No point credit will be given for unexcused lateness exceeding 5 days.
The Lab 1 Check off sheet is to be initialed by a TA or LA and included with
your report. Note that the check off sheet is NOT the report.
Labs 2 and 3 have intermediate due dates, such as check off, etc. Lateness on
these intermediate due dates does NOT result in automatic extensions for later
due dates, e.g. the report due date. For example, two days late on Lab 3 check
off will result in a penalty of 40% for points assigned to the check off. The
report is (still) due at the published due date. There is virtually no
modification required to a report depending on the working of your lab
implementation. However, reports with no lab effort will receive a zero.
The term project requirements must be completed in accordance with the schedule
given in the instructions. You must make a presentation of your part of your
project to the rest of the class after the logic diagram conference. You must
demonstrate (i.e., present) your term project even if it does not fully
function, and you must submit the written report in order to receive a passing
grade.
The assignment of letter grades (A,B,C,D,F) is an inherently subjective
process. We do, however, make use of numerical data. A single number is
computed by weighting graded assignments. The formula used may change slightly
from term to term.
The following weights are currently used:
    Grading criteria.
Activities    Percentages
Problem Sets  10%
Labs          35%
Quizzes       20%
Final Project 35%

We construct a histogram of these summary numbers and proceed to discuss
individual performances of virtually all students. Some of the factors
considered are:
   1. Diligence as measured by completion of most of the problem sets and by
      presence in the laboratory during final project time.
   2. Completion of Labs 2 and 3. Past history has been that it is extremely
      rare for a student to receive an A without completing Lab 3. Of course,
      it is possible to get a grade lower than an A even if Lab 3 is done.
   3. Project performance.
         1. Any student who does not turn in a final project report will
            receive an F.
         2. Students who do not construct a project will receive an F.
         3. Project complexity is an important factor in discriminating between
            an A and a B. An A is rarely given if theÂ final project is not as
            complicated as the last Lab.
Although 6.111 has a significant classroom component, it is primarily a lab
subject. Accomplishments in the lab tend to be weighted more heavily than other
components. The classroom component is viewed as supportive of the lab
components.
Traditionally, both average grade levels and average performance have been
quite high in 6.111. A large number of students do "A" level work and are,
indeed, rewarded with a grade of A. The corollary to this is that, since
average performance levels are so high, punting any part of the subject, even
the problem sets, can lead to a disappointing grade. It is important that you
keep up with the work.
Finally, and unfortunately, it is important for us to outline our expectations
for academic honesty in 6.111. We do this not because we expect any of you to
be dishonest, nor to insult your intelligence or character, but to avoid any
misunderstandings.
First, the quizzes are to be individual efforts. The problem sets and lab
exercises are also to be individual efforts; however, it is okay to ask
questions, get help from us, fellow students, or anyone else. But then, do them
by yourself. Indications of collaboration such as incidents of identical code
or copied figures are unacceptable and are liable to be dealt with in a
seemingly harsh fashion. Do not "dry lab" the design part of the laboratory
work. The TA's will be asking you about your solutions to make sure you really
do understand what you have done.
The Final Project is a different story. We do expect you to collaborate with
the course staff and with your fellow students, especially with your lab
partner. Joint or individual reports are acceptable, but in the case of joint
reports it is important that responsibility for each section of the work be
indicated.
**** Laboratory ****
Read the General Laboratory Information handout.
**** Schedule ****
The schedule of the lectures and assignments is posted on the course website.
Staying on schedule is very important in this subject, in order to be prepared
to do the term project, which is the single most important assignment in 6.111.
It will be an enjoyable experience if you are properly prepared.
**** Extra Units for 6.111 ****
Many 6.111 students spend more hours per week than warranted by the 12 unit
rating. Primarily this is due to large final projects. It is now possible to
register for 6.905 and gain an additional 6 units of credit for 6.111. Your
grade for 6.905 will be the same as your grade for 6.111. Your grade for 6.111
is not influenced by registration for 6.905.
Our motivation for enabling the availability of these extra units is two-fold.
Foremost is our desire to convince 6.111 students that they need not do a
project which is bigger and more complicated than ever done in the past.
Secondly, recognizing that many students will continue to do ambitious
projects, we would like to credit 6.111 students with units appropriate to work
expended.
Procedures for registering for the extra units by DROP date will be announced
later on in the term.Both the determination of grades and the project time
requirements are inherently subjective. The last Lab provides some guidance to
the evaluation of project size and complexity. Lab 3 can require almost a full
kit's worth of components. A reasonable guideline as to size of 6.111 projects
is that it not require more than a kit and a proto board per person.
6.111 student projects often become too large because of a desire to effect
computations in parallel and at high speed. Data paths are often unnecessarily
wide and redundant. It is generally far better to minimize the type and extent
of the data paths even though this results in more complicated control
circuitry.
Use of microprogrammed sequencers and FSMs implemented with PALs and CPLD's
allows implementation of complicated control with a small number of ICs. Please
remember that massive data paths that enable computation at speeds far faster
than needed do not represent a good design! It is almost always better to spend
more time thinking and less time wiring.
