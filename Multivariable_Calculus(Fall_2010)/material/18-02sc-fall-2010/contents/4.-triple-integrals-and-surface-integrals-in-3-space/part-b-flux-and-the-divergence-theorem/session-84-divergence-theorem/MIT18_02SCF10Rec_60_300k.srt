JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,840
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,050
In lecture, you've been learning
about flux and

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,570
surface integrals in the
divergence theorem, and I have

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,720
a nice problem about
that for you here.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,620
So I've got this field F, and
it's a little bit ugly right?

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,560
All right.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,970
So its coordinates are x to the
fourth y, minus 2x cubed y

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,890
squared, and z squared.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,750
And it's passing through the
surface of a solid that's

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,670
bounded by the plane z equals
0, by the plane z equals h,

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,412
and by the surface
x squared plus y

13
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:44,510
squared equals R squared.

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,400
So often we call this
solid a cylinder.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,010
So it's got its bottom surface
in the plane z equals 0, and

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,060
its top surface in the plane
z equals h, and it's got a

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,830
circular base with
radius R there.

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,540
So what I'd like you to do is
to compute the flux of this

19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,040
field F through this cylinder.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,800
So I'll point out before I let
you at it, that to compute

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,230
this as a surface integral,
you could do it.

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:15,980
You could do it.

23
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,090
If you really want an exercise
in nasty arithmetic, I invite

24
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,090
you to do it.

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,860
But you might be able to think
of a way to do this that

26
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,130
requires less effort than
parametrizing the three

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,420
surfaces and integrating
and so on.

28
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,620
So I'll leave you with that.

29
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,240
Why don't you pause the video,
work this one out, come back,

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,490
and we can work on
it together.

31
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:44,930

32
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,640
Hopefully, you had some luck
working on this problem.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,570
Right before I left, I mentioned
that you were

34
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,060
computing a flux through a
surface here, but that doing

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,750
it as a surface integral is
maybe not the best way to go.

36
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,500
And so, even without that hint,
probably many of you

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,210
realized that really the way
that we want to go about this

38
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,680
problem is with the divergence
theorem.

39
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,190
OK.

40
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:12,470
So in our case, the divergence
theorem--

41
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm just abbreviating
it div T-H-M here--

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,840
says start with the double
integral over the surface of F

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,760
dot n d surface area.

44
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,220
So S here is the surface
of this solid.

45
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,780
So the divergence theorem says
that this surface integral,

46
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,670
which is the flux that we're
interested in, is equal to the

47
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,970
triple integral over the solid
region D-- so that's bounded

48
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,565
by the surface, and so that's
the solid cylinder here--

49
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:49,410

50
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:55,370
of div F dV. OK.

51
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,200
So in our case, this is nice,
because in fact, this solid

52
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,120
region D is an easier to
understand, or easier to

53
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,890
grapple with region than
the surface that we

54
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,680
started with, right?

55
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,200
It's just one solid piece.

56
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,910
It's easy to parametrize,
in fact.

57
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,060
It's easy to describe especially
in cylindrical

58
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,630
coordinates, but also in
rectangular coordinates.

59
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,820
Whereas this surface S, if we
wanted to talk about it, we'd

60
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,130
need to split it up into three
pieces, and we'd need to

61
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,010
parametrize it.

62
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,010
And it's kind of a hassle,
relatively speaking.

63
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,510
Also, the divergence of this
field F is a lot simpler than

64
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,470
the field itself.

65
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,240
If we go and look at this field,
all of its components

66
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,930
are polynomials.

67
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,690
To compute its divergence,
we take

68
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,260
derivatives of all of them.

69
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,950
And so that makes their degrees
lower, and then we

70
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,310
just add them.

71
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,330
Life is a little bit simpler.

72
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,990
So OK.

73
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,140
So this process of using the
divergence theorem is going to

74
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,690
make our lives easier.

75
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,870
It's going to make this nasty
surface integral into an easy

76
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,860
to compute triple integral.

77
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,580
So let's see actually
how it does.

78
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,680
So let's compute div F first.
So we know what

79
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,930
the integrand is.

80
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,500

81
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,490
All right.

82
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,820
So we need to look at the
components of F, and so we

83
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,120
need to take the partial
of the first one

84
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,140
with respect to x.

85
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,620
So that's x to the fourth
y with respect to x.

86
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,240
So put that down over here.

87
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,090
That's 4x cubed y.

88
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,020
We just treat y as a constant.

89
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,500
OK, so now we come back
and we need to look

90
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,390
at the second one.

91
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,130
So it's minus 2x cubed
y squared.

92
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,000
And it's the second one.

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,260
We take its partial
with respect to y.

94
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:34,780
So OK.

95
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,300
So that's going to be minus
2x cubed times 2y.

96
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,360
So that's going to be
minus 4x cubed y.

97
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,320
And then we come back and we
look at the last component.

98
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,670
And that's z squared.

99
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,090
And so we need to take its
partial with respect to z.

100
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,010
So in this case, that's
just 2z, and so we

101
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,000
add that on as well.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,110
Plus 2z.

103
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,475
And in this case, not only are
these polynomials simpler than

104
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:03,980
the coordinates of F that we
had, but in fact, we've got

105
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,970
some simplification here.

106
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,600
Life gets really,
really simple.

107
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,720
So in fact, this is just going
to work out to 2z.

108
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,600
So the divergence here is very
simple compared with the

109
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,320
function F. More simple than we
have a right to expect, but

110
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,980
in any case, good.

111
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,830
It's nice to work with.

112
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,450
OK.

113
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,700
So that's the divergence.

114
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,370

115
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,320
So I'm going to write,
this is the flux.

116
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,670
These integrals that we're
interested in.

117
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,600
This surface integral, and
then by the divergence

118
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,250
theorem, it's the same as
this triple integral.

119
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,130
So the divergence is this 2z.

120
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,960
So the flux is what I get when
I just put that in here.

121
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:53,990
So flux is equal to the triple
integral over our solid of 2z

122
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,810
dV. OK, so I've left some
stuff out of this.

123
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,910
Because I'm going to start
writing down the bounds and

124
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,840
writing this down as an
iterated integral now.

125
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,070
OK.

126
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,140
So we have to choose some
coordinate system in which to

127
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,620
integrate over this solid.

128
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,620
And so we have three kinds of
natural choices that we always

129
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,230
look back to.

130
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,630
There are rectangular
coordinates and cylindrical

131
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,970
coordinates and spherical
coordinates.

132
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,700
So spherical coordinates seem
pretty clearly inappropriate.

133
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,220
Rectangular and cylindrical?

134
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,470
You know, you could try and
do it in rectangular.

135
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,890
It's not horrible.

136
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,950
But this is a cylinder, right?

137
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,760
I mean, it's crying out for
us to use cylindrical

138
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,910
coordinates.

139
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,350
So let's use cylindrical
coordinates.

140
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,700
So we're going to use
cylindrical coordinates.

141
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,250
So to get dV we need a z, an r,
and a theta, but remember

142
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,800
there's this extra
factor of r.

143
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:56,250
So it's going to be 2z times
r dz dr d theta.

144
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:56,480
Right?

145
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,950
This is dV. This r dz
dr d theta part.

146
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,370
So that's what dV is when we use
cylindrical coordinates.

147
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,840
OK, so now let's figure out
what the bounds are.

148
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,710
So let's go look
at the cylinder

149
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,635
that we had over here.

150
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:13,220

151
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,375
So it's bounded between z equals
0 at the bottom surface

152
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,610
and z equals h at
the top surface.

153
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,270
OK.

154
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,380
So that's easy enough.

155
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,980
That's what the bounds
on z are.

156
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,760
So let's put those in.

157
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:33,380
So z is the innermost one, so
that's going from 0 to h.

158
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:33,650
OK.

159
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,790
How about the next one?

160
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,000
So the next one is r.

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,470
So let's go back over here.

162
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:44,080
So r is the radius here after
we project it down.

163
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,000
And we just get the circle
of radius big R

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,160
centered at the origin.

165
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,110
So little r is going
from 0 to big R.

166
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,220
And theta is the circle.

167
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,950
It's the whole circle.

168
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,690
So theta is going
from 0 to 2 pi.

169
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,060
So cylinders are really easy
to describe what they look

170
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,610
like in cylindrical
coordinates.

171
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,390
So let's put those in.

172
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:07,450
So little r is going from
0 to big R, and theta is

173
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,990
going from 0 to 2 pi.

174
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,720

175
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,260
OK.

176
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,270
Wonderful.

177
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,480
Now we just have to compute
this, right?

178
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,930
We've got our flux is this
triple integral.

179
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,850
So let's compute it.

180
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,990
Let's walk over to this little
bit of empty board space.

181
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,830
OK, so we have an iterated
integral.

182
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,280
So let's do it.

183
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,230
So the inner integral
is the integral from

184
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:38,770
0 to h of 2zr dz.

185
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,750
Well, that's not that bad.

186
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,690
That's equal to r
as a constant.

187
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:50,520
So it's equal to rz squared
as z goes between 0 and h.

188
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,950
It's dz, so z is going
from 0 to h.

189
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:59,190
So plug in, and we just get
h squared r minus 0.

190
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,860
So just h squared r.

191
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,150
OK.

192
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,740
So now let's do the
middle integral.

193
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,320
So the middle integral is the
integral from 0 to big R d

194
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,550
little r of the inner
integral.

195
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:21,090
So this is the integral from 0
to big R of the inner integral

196
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,260
which was h squared little
r d little r.

197
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:25,930
OK.

198
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,020
And that's not that
bad either.

199
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,600
So h is just a constant.

200
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:35,350
So this is equal to 1/2 h
squared r squared from r

201
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,960
equals 0 to big R. And
so that's 1/2 h

202
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,810
squared big R squared.

203
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,230
That's the middle integral.

204
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,230
So the outer one now.

205
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,982
OK.

206
00:09:48,982 --> 00:09:50,290
So let's go back and look.

207
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,050
So we're doing d theta as theta
goes from 0 to 2 pi of

208
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,340
whatever the middle
integral was.

209
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:03,540
So it's the integral from 0 to
2 pi of whatever the value of

210
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,350
the middle integral was.

211
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:10,110
So this is 1/2 h squared
big R squared d theta.

212
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,670
And this is all just constant
with respect to theta.

213
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:18,950
So that's going to be just
pi h squared r squared.

214
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,150
You're just multiplying
it by 2 pi.

215
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,470
All right.

216
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,070
So pi h squared r squared.

217
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,010
So this is our final answer.

218
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,570
Let's just quickly recap
what we did.

219
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:32,250
We had to compute the flux of
this field F through the

220
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:37,190
surface of a solid cylinder.

221
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,260
And so we had options.

222
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,520
We could do it directly by
trying to compute the surface

223
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,780
integrals, but in this case,
life was a lot easier if we

224
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,560
applied the divergence
theorem.

225
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,120
So the divergence theorem
says that the flux--

226
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,170
which is equal to this
surface integral--

227
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,180
can also be written as the
triple integral over the solid

228
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,330
region bounded by the
surface of the

229
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,490
divergence of the field.

230
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,050
All right.

231
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,390
And so in our case, the
divergence was very nice and

232
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:09,160
simple, and the solid region
D was relatively simpler to

233
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,590
describe than-- its surface
that bounds it--

234
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,290
S. So this is why we think of
the divergence theorem.

235
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,890
Because the divergence of the
field is easy to understand,

236
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,210
and the solid is easier to
describe than its surface.

237
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,360
So those are both things that
make us think to use the

238
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,090
divergence theorem for
a problem like this.

239
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,580
So then by the divergence
theorem, the flux is just that

240
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,860
triple integral, and so we wrote
it out here that we were

241
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,340
integrating over a cylinder.

242
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,530
So a natural thing to do is use
cylindrical coordinates.

243
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,030
And then we computed the
triple integral just

244
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,340
like we always do.

245
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,955
I did it in three steps: inner,
middle, and outer.

246
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:48,780
You don't have to do it
exactly this way if

247
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,280
you don't want to.

248
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,010
But it works for me.

249
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:52,450
OK.

250
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,220
And we got our final answer:
pi h squared r squared.

251
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,050
I'll stop there.

252
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,452
