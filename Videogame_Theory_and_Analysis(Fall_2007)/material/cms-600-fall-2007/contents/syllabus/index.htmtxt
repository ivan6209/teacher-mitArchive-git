***** Course Description *****
This course will serve as an introduction to the interdisciplinary academic
study of videogames, examining their cultural, educational, and social
functions in contemporary settings. By playing, analyzing, and reading and
writing about videogames, we will examine debates surrounding how they function
within socially situated contexts in order to better understand games'
influence on and reflections of society. Readings will include contemporary
videogame theory and the completion of a contemporary commercial videogame
chosen in consultation with the instructor.
Writing, reading, and playing will be heavy, but students will also be required
to present game analyses at each class meeting, providing other students with
the opportunity to observe a wide variety of game genres, play styles, and
designed rule systems. By examining games together in class, we will discuss
how various theories of game design and play are applied to games as texts.
Students will be invited to present out-of-game learning and literacy
activities as data that show how games are used and played in their organic
settings; we will study the implications of these data as well.
While this course serves as an introduction to the emerging field of game
studies, students are free to bring their own disciplinary expertise to the
classroom setting. Perspectives from computer science, architecture, media
studies, literature, engineering, physics, etc. are all welcome and will add a
healthy intellectual rigor to the course. Likewise, students without experience
playing or observing videogames are highly encouraged to enroll, as their
perspectives and points of view help others see what they're missing, so to
speak.
Note: Though the course subject matter is videogame theory and analysis, we
will not be producing games in this class. Instead, we will analyze games as
interactive media, as rule-based systems, as cultural and social texts, and as
designed learning spaces. We will concentrate heavily on games' potential
impact on society, their cultural influence, and their phenomenology and
ontology. Students will not be expected to create, design, or produce games or
simulations for this course.
***** Course Goals *****
    * To introduce students to the emerging field of videogame studies and its
      foundational academic research and publications.
    * To explore videogames' impact as contemporary cultural texts, each with
      their own social communities and significance as media.
    * To connect and compare videogames to other contemporary digital (and
      nondigital) media.
    * To be introduced to a variety of games-related careers and studies
      through discussions with professionals working in videogames and
      interactive media.
***** Required Texts *****
[Buy_at_Amazon] Salen, K., and E. Zimmerman. The_Game_Design_Reader:_A_Rules_of
Play_Anthology. Cambridge, MA: MIT University Press, 2005. ISBN: 9780262195362.
Please check the MIT Press Bookstore for discounted student copies.
Readings that are not included in the Salen &amp; Zimmerman book will be
available as .pdf downloads from the MIT Server Web site or as links to their
online locations.
Regular upkeep with readings associated with your game: magazine / online
reviews, bulletin board discussions and forums, fan-produced media and texts,
online chats, etc.
***** Student Requirements *****
    * Complete all assigned readings and weekly writings.
    * Complete (or play, at minimum, 70 hours of) a single contemporary
      videogame or a grouping of games in a particular series or genre
      (example: Civilization III and IV, plus expansions or online play; the
      Zelda series, etc.).
    * Present a formal in-class analysis of your game (see attached
      assignment).
    * Midterm and Final exams, which will include a writing component.
    * Adhere strictly to attendance policy.
***** Weekly Details *****
With a few exceptions, Mondays will be spent examining the readings, organized
by theme. Students will be expected to have completed the summary assignment by
11:59 pm the night before and review each other's work before the start of
class the next day. On Wednesdays, students' formal analyses will be presented
to the class as scheduled with the instructor. See attached analysis assignment
and assessment details.
Monday night labs will be spent with a series of guest speakers pre-arranged by
the instructor. Guests are from a variety of game-related contexts, including
developers and designers from the games industry, games researchers, artists
and interactive media specialists. Lab attendance is required.
Midterm and final exams will cover a variety of topics from the readings, class
discussions, and guest presentations. Graduate students may choose to organize
these exams in connection with their theses or longer games-related projects,
but they should make these arrangements with the instructor early in the
semester.
**** Exam Dates ****
The Midterm Exam will take place in Ses #11, either during class or during lab.
The MIT Scheduling office will announce its final exam schedule, at which point
the time, date and location for the final will be determined.
**** About Attendance ****
Required, on-time attendance is expected. Students are allowed a total of two
missed classes (including labs) before a penalty is assigned. After two
absences, your final grade will be lowered by one half (a B will become a B-
and so forth). Students more than ten minutes late for class (after 9:45 am or
7:15 pm) will be counted absent. This attendance policy will be strictly
enforced. And no, missing class because you couldn't stop playing your game is
not a good excuse, even for this class.
***** Grading *****
                      Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES                                         PERCENTAGES
In-class participation and weekly summary postings 30%
One formal analysis presentation                   15%
Midterm                                            25%
Final                                              30%
Â 
Graduate students may elect to submit papers for the midterm and final
examinations.
**** About Grading ****
I welcome all questions about grading, provided these conversations happens in-
person during office hours or by appointment with me. Like all instructors, I'm
busy, but I'm always glad to find a time to meet with you. For all assignments
I will provide you with clear expectations. Read them. I work very hard to
write clear and careful assignments. It's been my experience that students who
take the time to read assignments carefully do much better when it comes time
for assessment. I will also gladly clarify my expectations with any assignment
so don't be shy about asking me to do so.
**** Public Work ****
All written and submitted work will have the potential to be made public and
available via in-class distribution or on the class Web site. I will regularly
use other students' work to as models for good thinking and writing. Students
work will never be used to exemplify poor thinking or writing. In other words,
this policy is just for good, not for evil. Please notify me in advance if you
choose to keep your work private. This notification should be made with each
assignment you hand in.
***** Resources *****
The Writing and Communication Center offers you free professional advice from
published writers about oral presentations and about all types of academic,
creative, and professional writing. Go to MIT_online_Writing_and_Communication
Center and click on the yellow sunburst. If you cannot find an open appointment
slot, do not despair. There are always cancellations on the day of the
appointment (sometimes as many as 15 cancellations in one day). Click on the
Wait List (the blue strip that says "Is the time that you want already
reserved?"). Whenever a cancellation occurs on that day, you will be
automatically notified by email. Because several people might receive that same
message, go online ASAP to schedule that open spot; 96% of clients who want an
appointment end up with one if they use the Wait List. If you still can't find
an appointment, try the Online_Tutor.
***** Plagiarism *****
Lucky for all of you, I will devote some specific class time to talking about
plagiarism and how to cite sources properly. Unlucky for you, I'll hold you to
that knowledge. In other words, if you've not had practice in learning how to
cite sources properly, I'd suggest you spend some time with the Writing and
Communication Center or come to my office and I'll walk you through it
personally. Since the midterm and final exam have writing components to them,
you might want to spend some time learning the difference between a reference
list and an in-text citation, between MLA and APA, between a quotation and a
paraphrase. More information on MIT's policy is available here: MIT_Academic
Integrity.
