Joint Program students enrolled in the Geodynamics seminar are required to
complete a project for the class. This includes research, an oral presentation
during the last two or three seminar meetings, and a written paper due at the
end of the semester. For first and second year students, the project must be on
a topic related to the theme of the seminar and must be different from their
main research interest. For more advanced students, the topic may be closely
related to their dissertation research.
The following topics are suggested as potential student projects (advisor
listed in bold):
***** Jack Whitehead *****
**** Melt Channel Formation ****
The first experiment involves the formation of channels of melt in a host
material that is brought below its solidification temperature. Previous work
with Peter Kelemen and many students has involved the formation of dissolution
channels in a porous matrix of crystals but we were always frustrated by the
lack of a nice simple laboratory verification of our ideas. The present
experiment is a gross simplification, but it does develop melt channels
surrounded by a cooled solid very nicely. In addition to the porous flow
applications, it can also be applied to lava tubes, the flow of lava through
fissures and even melt channels in glaciers. A disk of aluminum is placed on a
table and carefully leveled. Connected to the underside is a water chamber held
at a fixed temperature with a thermostatic bath. Above this disk is a thin gap
1.25 mm high and above the gap is a thick Plexiglas disk of the same diameter.
A liquid (1-hexadecene) with a solidification temperature of 3.9 deg C is
pumped into a hole at the center of this disk at constant rate. I call this
liquid a wax as it is very much like paraffin except that it solidifies below
room temperature. The wax has to flow outward through the narrow gap toward the
rim of the discs. After leaving the disk, the liquid spills into a catch basin,
where it is available to the pump for another cycle. Taking a radial coordinate
system for the gap we find that at room temperature the wax flows radially
outward with no variation of rate with. However, with temperature of the cold
bath set at -5 deg C the flow occupies a channel with the rest of the wax in
the gap solid. We need to continue experiments by varying flow rate and cold
temperature, looking at the transient case where the channel sets up and so
forth. Experiments so far are preliminary and the project is ready to move into
a stage with some good experiments and hopefully some nice original theory.
Videos are especially interesting. The apparatus is ready to go and many
interesting small projects are possible.
**** Continents as Floating Junk ****
The difference between ocean floor and the surface of continents is the
greatest surface irregularity in geology. About 30% of the planet's surface is
continents and 70% is ocean floor. In addition with such great amounts of
surface water covering the Earth, one might expect that life only exists
because of the continents. They allow a large area of the planet to project
above sea level. The continents and the global tectonics might be mechanically
related, and it would be good to try and quantify a simple example of that.
What kind of project can look at the role of continents in our earth and its
evolution? First, note that if continental crust were spread evenly over the
surface of the earth, and if we use the present depth of continents of ~60 km,
the redistributed material would only be 18 km deep. Since continent density is
2800 kg/m^3, and mantle density is more like 3300 kg/m^3, the continents would
be submerged. Using present volumes of continental crust and ocean water for
calculations, only when continental crust is gathered to cover an area less
than about 35 % of the earth surface area is the crust thick enough for the
continental masses to float on the mantle with elevations above the water
surface. The "gathering" mechanism is known. It is the collisions of continents
with either other continents, as in India, or with subduction zones as in the
Andies. In other words, the continents are thickened vertically, and contracted
laterally by mountain building. The continents might also ride over subduction
zones and extinguish them, and thus alter the pattern of mantle motions. And
finally, the continents are thinned by erosion, which spreads out the material
from mountains on lateral continent regions, and also returns some to the sea
as sediment. There is also some evidence that mountain regions diverge
laterally through gravitational spreading. It would be nice to connect the
continent divergence, the rafting of continents to subduction zones, the
thickening by convergence and mountain building, the interaction with the
descending slabs and the spread by erosion as one dynamically coupled process
between mantle and continent. This is asking a lot, so smaller experiments are
good to get things started. I would like to see an experiment in the laboratory
(or perhaps even theory or a simple computer model) that looks at floating
material interacting with mantle convection motion. Some experiments have been
tried using silicon oil, and corn syrup. We have made one experiment that drove
"mantle circulation" with rollers rather than heat flux. We have made a few
measurements of the thinning and thickening of a layer of high-viscosity
silicon oil floating on syrup driven by rollers (as a substitute for the mantle
convection). More could be done along this line with the apparatus.

**** Wavelet-based Analysis of Martian Topography ****
The geology of Mars is marked by an hemispheric dichotomy between a low-
standing, sedimented, northern hemisphere and a high-standing, relatively bare,
southern hemisphere. Sedimentation in the northern hemisphere has been deduced
from the appearance of ridges and craters but these analysis are mainly
qualitative. The project will consist in using 2D wavelets to characterize in
an unbiased way selected craters and ridges on both hemisphere and test whether
significant differences in the shape of these features can be detected. Over a
longer term, this project can grow into a global analysis which can be used for
automated detection and characterization of surface feature on Mars, Venus, and
the Earth. The differences seen between southern and northern hemispheres of
Mars can then be used to constrain the style of sedimentation (duration,
aeolian vs. submarine) (proposal to be submitted to NASA.)
**** Stretching the Crust of Ganymede ****
Bright terrain on Ganymede displays regularly spaced faults and longer-
wavelength topographic undulations. These characteristics can be explained
using a localization instability of the crust and long-range interaction
between faults. Although instability wavelengths can be predicted with a semi-
analytical technique. However, the growth rate and therefore the dominant
instability needs to be solved numerically. The project will consist on
exploring conditions that lead to creation of two-wavelength deformation using
the code LAYER. Programming can be kept to a minimum, or new code
implementations can be decided depending on student interest. The project grow
to further models of rift features on Venus and the Earth as well as Ganymede
and various code improvement activities.
**** Metamorphic Assemblages and the Possibility of Crustal Delamination on
Mars and Venus ****
The geology of Venus contains circular features named coronae for which there
is no good terrestrial equivalent. Coronae are generally thought to be due to
mantle plume although more recent research showed that delamination may produce
similar geomorphological features. Delamination refers to the process by which
the lower crust becomes denser than the mantle and starts sinking into it. The
project will evaluate the likelihood of delamination by computing the expected
mineral assemblages and overall density of the Venusian crust and mantle using
the thermodynamics software perplex. A similar analysis should be doable for
Mars (which does not show obvious corona-like features); Jull and Kelemen
conducted a similar analysis for the Earth and Mark Behn used perplex,
providing local expertise. The project can be continued in the long term with
numerical models of fault patterns due to delamination, if this mechanism is
possible on Venus.

**** Scaling Relations of Open Normal Faults ****
High-resolution bathymetry of the Explorer ridge reveals open normal faults,
i.e., fissure with a degree of vertical motion. Similar features are observed
in Iceland and at the East African rift. It is thought that these features are
due to a transition form tension cracks near the surface to Andersonian normal
faults at depth. The project will consist on constructing 3D Boundary Element
Models using the code 3D-def in which the fault geometry at depth and failure
mode a specified a priori. We will determine the magnitude of slip and open for
various slip geometry leading to a characterization of the effect of fault
geometry on the relation between fault length and displacement and opening
profiles. The project can be pursued further by participating in the mapping
activities at the Explorer and Juan de Fuca ridges and incorporating new
features into the numerical code that will be used to model fault propagation
(NSF grant submitted).

**** Understanding the Fate of Carbon in Subducted Sediments ****
Remarkably, the impact of subduction on redox budgets associated with the
carbon cycle has not been discussed in the literature. There is, however, a
growing body of information on the behavior of carbon in subduction zones. I
think that it should be possible to use that information to establish the first
set of boundary conditions defining the potential effects of these processes.

**** Compositional Heterogeneity of the Early Earth ****
The present day geochemical heterogeneity of the Earth reflects the integrated
effects of a succession of geodynamic processes, beginning with accretion in
the solar nebula, moving through core formation, and leading to the present
situation of convection in a stratified mantle. For the sake of modeling it is
often assumed that the early Earth had a homogeneous chondritic composition,
but is this justified? What degree of heterogeneity would be expected from the
processes of accretion and core formation? This project will begin with a
literature search, and then move towards attempting to generate first order
constraints on the effect of parameters such as temperature and oxidation state
on the composition of the early Earth. The project will involve a mix of mantle
geochemistry, physics, and statistics.

**** Heterotrophic Eukaryotes Associated with Modern Marine Stromatolites ****
Stromatolites are layered, mounded sedimentary structures built by a
combination of microbial activities, abiotic carbonate precipitation, and
sedimentologic processes. The oldest stromatolite fossils are ancient (>2
billion years old), causing them to be one of the most visible manifestations
of extensive ancient life on Earth. Although some stromatolites are found
living today in certain areas, the details of stromatolite formation and
preservation are not well understood. One popular hypothesis to explain a
decline in stromatolite abundance and diversity at ~1 million years ago is that
eukaryotic organisms evolved to become predators on stromatolites. The most
commonly proposed predatory culprit is an unknown metazoan, although evidence
of such an organism is lacking from the fossil record. Protists are additional
possible stromatolitic predators, but they have been largely ignored in this
context. The goal of this project is to describe the eukaryotic community
(protists, including foraminiferans, and metazoans) associated with selected
modern stromatolites (i.e., Shark Bay, Australia; Highborne Cay, Bahamas) in
terms of community structure. That data will serve as a foundation for future
comparative studies of the stromatolitic sediment fabric and their sequestered
organic biomarkers in modern and ancient stromatolites to elucidate the reasons
for stromatolitic demise and better identify Earth's early ecosystem.

**** Spatial variations in the recorded tsunami wave heights in the Indian
Ocean coastal regions and correlation with the giant earthquake of Dec. 26,
2004 off Sumatra, Indonesia ****
In this project you will work with Jian Lin to analyze hydrographic records in
Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, and other coastal areas in the northeastern Indian
Ocean to examine patterns of spatial variations in the 2004 Indian Ocean
tsunami. The land data will be compared to complementary information extracted
from satellite images. The goal is to compare the tsunami amplitude spatial
patterns to independent models of earthquake rupture to better understand how
this devastating tsunami is related to the ocean floor rupture caused by the
magnitude 9 earthquake off Sumatra, Indonesia.

**** Origin of Continental Flood Basalts ****
Continental flood basalts are massive eruptions that have occurred throughout
geologic history. These eruptions often produce millions of cubic kilometers of
basalt on the time scale of only a million years. Examples include the Deccan
Traps in India, the Ventersdorp, Bushveld, and Karoo Volcanics in South Africa,
the Parana Flood Basalts in Brazil, and the Columbia River Basalts in the
United States. Typically, flood basalts have been interpreted as melting events
produced by one of two mechanisms: 1) elevated mantle temperatures associated
with plumes and/or 2) adiabatic-decompression melting associated with
lithospheric rifting. An important implication of these models is that they
require a large component of lithospheric thinning in conjunction with melting.
However, geophysical and geochemical data from flood basalts in cratonic
settings such as southern Africa are inconsistent with these conventional
mechanisms. In southern Africa xenolith data show evidence for the survival of
thick lithosphere beneath Archean flood basalt domains, precluding significant
thinning of the lithosphere. These observations suggest that the melting
associated with the flood basalt eruptions must have occurred at sub-
lithospheric depths (>200 km). This inference is consistent with recent seismic
observations of melt reservoirs at depths of 200-300 km. Major and trace
element chemistry of erupted basalts provides a means to determine the pressure
and temperature of mantle melting. For example, melts from deep, hot mantle
have higher FeO contents at a given concentration of MgO than melts from
relatively cooler mantle that partially melts at shallower depths. The goal of
this project will be to locate and use existing geochemical data to constrain
melting conditions for a number of continental flood basalts with a focus on
the events in southern Africa. The inferred melting conditions will be used
place new constraints on the origin of continental flood basalts.
