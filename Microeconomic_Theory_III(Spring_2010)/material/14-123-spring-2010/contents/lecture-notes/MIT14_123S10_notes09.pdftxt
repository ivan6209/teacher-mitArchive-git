Correlated  and  Sequential  Equilibria


In this  lecture,  I will cover two  important equilibrium concepts, namely correlated equi-
librium and sequential equilibrium.  Correlated equilibrium relaxes the assumption in the 
Nash  equilibrium  that  the  players’ mixed  strategies  are  independent  (hence  the  name). 
It  is  therefore  weaker  than  Nash  equilibrium.  It  is  stronger  than  rationalizability.  On 
the  other  hand,  sequential  equilibrium  is  an  equilibrium  reﬁnement.  Unlike  other  re-
ﬁnements,  sequential  equilibrium  makes  the  players’  beliefs  about  the  other  players’ 
strategies  as  an  explicit  part  of  equilibrium,  in  addition  to  strategy  proﬁles.  It  is  one 
of the most commonly used solution concepts,  especially  in dynamic games with  incom-
plete  information.  For  a  more  detailed  discussion  of  these  topics,  see  Fudenberg  and 
Tirole’s  chapters  2.2  and  8.3. 

9.1  Correlated  Equilibrium 

In a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium it is assumed that the strategies are independently 
distributed.  As  it  is  explained  in  the previous  lecture,  there  is no  reason  to believe  that 
a  player’s  belief  about  the  other  players’  strategies  are  independent.  Likewise,  from 
an  econometrician’s  point  of  view  the  distribution  of  the  strategy  proﬁles  may  contain 
correlation.  Correlated  equilibrium drops  the  independence  assumption. 
There are  two ways to deﬁne  correlated  equilibrium.  One  way  is  to  describe  each 
player’s  information structure explicitly and  impose the assumption that every player  is 
a  best  response.  Another  way  is  to  consider  the  distribution  induced  by  such  a  model

on  the  strategy  proﬁle.  The  latter  distribution  is  then  characterized  by  using  a  simpler 
reduced  form  structure.  I  will  ﬁrst  present  the  ﬁrst formulation,  which makes the  logic 
of  the  solution  concepts  and  its  relation  to  rationalizability  clearer. 

Deﬁnition  34  A (common-prior)  information structure  is a  list  (Ω, I1 , . . . , In , p) where 
Ω  is  a  (ﬁnite)  state  space,  p  is  a  probability  distribution  on  Ω  and  Ii  is  the  information 
partition  of  player  i  for  each  i. 

I  will  write  Ii  (ω)  for  the  cell  of  the  partition  Ii  that  contains  ω .  Here,  if  the  true 
state  is  ω , player  i  is  informed  that  the  true  state  is  in  Ii  (ω),  and  he  does  not  get 
any  other  information.  Such  an  information  structure  arises  if  each  player  observes  a 
state-dependent  signal,  where  Ii (ω)  is  the  set  of  states  in which  the  value  of  the  signal 
of  player  i  is  identical  to  the  value  of  the  signal  at  state  ω . 
Finally, p  is a common prior on Ω.  I will assume without  loss of generality that each 
information set Ii  (ω) has positive probability,  i.e., p (Ii (ω)) > 0.  Hence, by Bayes’ rule, 
observing  that  the  true  state  is  in Ii (ω), player  i updates his belief  to p (·|Ii (ω)), which 
is  a  probability  distribution  on  Ii (ω), where 

p (ω 0 |Ii  (ω)) =

Deﬁnition  35  An  adapted  strategy  proﬁle  (s1 , . . . , sn)  with  respect  to  information 
structure  (Ω, I1 , . . . , In , p)  is  a  list  of  mappings  si  :  Ω 
Si  such  that  si (ω) =  si  (ω 0)
→ 
whenever  Ii  (ω) = Ii (ω 0). 

Here,  the  last  condition  guarantees  that  player  i  knows what strategy he is playing. 

Deﬁnition  36  A correlated equilibrium with respect to information structure (Ω, I1 , . . . , In , p) 
is  a  strategy  proﬁle  (s1 , . . . , sn)  with  respect  to  (Ω, I1 , . . . , In , p)  such  that  for  each  i  and 
ω ,  si (ω)  is  a  best  response  to  s−i  under  p (ω 0 |Ii (ω)),  i.e.,  for  al l  si , 
X 
ui  (si  (ω) , s−i  (ω 0 )) p (ω 0 |Ii  (ω)) 
E [ui  (si (ω) , s−i) |Ii  (ω)]  ≡

The condition  in  the deﬁnition  is,  of  course,  equivalent  to  si  being  a  best  response 
in  the  ex-ante  stage.  That  is, 
X

Example  3  As  an  example,  study  the  correlated  equilibria  of  the  game  in Figure  2.4  in 
Fudenberg  and  Tirole. 

Note  that  for  any  ω ,  si (ω)  is  a  best  response  to  a  correlated  belief  pi,ω  about  the 
P 
other players’ strategy proﬁles where pi,ω  (s−i) = 
p (ω 0 |Ii  (ω)). By the 
ω 0∈Ii (ω),s−i (ω 0 )=s−i 
same  token,  for  each  sj  with  pi,ω  (sj )  >  0,  sj  is  a best response  to a belief  pj,ω 0 , where 
sj  (ω 0 ) =  sj ,  and  this  is  true  ad  inﬁnitum.  Hence,  si  (ω)  is  rationalizable  for  player  i. 
Therefore,  correlated equilibrium is stronger than rationalizability.  Note moreover that, 
unlike  rationalizability,  which  does  not  put  any  restriction  about  the  beliefs  other  than 
the above best response condition,  the belief sequences obtained above exhibit stringent 
properties,  as  they  are  derived  from  a  common  prior  p  using  the  Bayes’  rule.  This  is 
indeed  the  only  distinction  between  the  two  concept. 
A  common-prior  information  structure  assumes  that  the  players’  share  a  common 
prior  belief.  In  a more  general  information/belief  structure,  each  player would  have  his 
belief  at  each  information  set of  his,  and  this  can be  represented by a  list  of  probability 
distributions  p1 , . . . , pn  on  Ω, where  pi  represent  the  (hypothetical)  prior  distribution 
of  player  i.  The  common-prior  information  structure  assumes  that  p1  =
=  pn .
· · · 
Rationalizability correspond to each player playing a best response at every information 
set  in  a  general  information  structure. 
In  the above deﬁnition, we have an explicit information  structure.  One may be only 
interested in the probability distribution on the strategy proﬁles induced by (s, (Ω, I1 , . . . , In , p)). 
In  that  case, we  can use  a  simpler  formulation  as  follows. 

Deﬁnition  37  A correlated equilibrium is a probability distribution p on S  such that for 
each  si  and  s0i , 

X
s−i∈S−i 

ui (si , s−i) p (s−i |si ) ≥ 

X 
s−i∈S−i 

ui (s0i , s−i) p (s−i |si ) . 

(9.1) 

98 

CHAPTER  9.  CORRELATED AND SEQUENTIAL EQUILIBRIA 

Note that this deﬁnition is a special case of the previous one in which the information 
structure  is  as  follows 

(9.2) 

Ii  (s) = 

Ω  =  S 
= ©¡si , s0 ¢ 
ª 
s0
−i  | −i  ∈ S−i 
{si} × S−i 
.
Conversely, in order to capture probability distributions induced by correlated equilibria 
with respect to arbitrary information structures, it suﬃces to consider this limited set of 
information structures.  To see this, take any correlated equilibrium (s, (Ω, I1 , . . . , In , p)). 
P 
The distribution p˜ induced by (s, (Ω, I1 , . . . , In , p)) on S is given by p˜ (s) = 
ω∈Ω,s(ω)=s p (ω). 
Now suppose that instead of letting i know that the true state is in Ii (ω), we only inform 
him  that  he  needs  to  play  si  (ω)  according  to  si .  Since  he  did  not  have  an  incentive  to 
deviate  under  any  information  (by  deﬁnition  of  correlated  equilibrium),  by  sure-thing 
principle, he does not have an incentive to deviate.  Hence, the new information structure 
with  limited  information  is  also  a  correlated  equilibrium.  Since  ui  does  not  depend  on 
ω ,  the  latter  information  structure  can  be  represented  by  (9.2). 

Exercise  14  Find  al l  the  correlated  equilibria  (as  distributions  on  S ) for  the game of 
Figure  2.4  in  Fudenberg  and  Tirole. 

9.2  Sequential  Equilibria 

Consider the game in Figure 9.1.  One can easily check that the strategy proﬁle indicated 
with thick  lines  is a Nash equilibrium.  Since the game does not have a proper subgame, 
it  is  also  a  subgame-perfect  equilibrium.  Nevertheless,  the  equilibrium  prescribes  the 
irrational move L  for Player  2  at  the  information  set  she moves.  At  the  information  set 
she moves, she knows that Player 1 has played T or B. No matter what she believes about 
the likelihood of T or B, she ﬁnds R a better move than L, because conditional on T and 
B, R dominates L. Sequential equilibrium explicitly speciﬁes the beliefs of players at each 
information set that they move and requires that the players act rationally according to 
these  beliefs  and  that  the  beliefs  are  consistent with  the  solution. 
Formally,  consider  an  extensive  form  game.  Consider  an  information  set  h  at which 
a player  i (h)  moves,  where  h  is  a  collection  of  nodes  that  i  is  to  move  and  cannot 
distinguish from  each other.  At  h, player  i (h)  knows  that he is  at one  of  the nodes  h,

but  he  does  not  anything more  than  that.  Hence,  being  an  expected  utility maximizer, 
he  has  a  belief  about  the  nodes,  a  probability  distribution  μ (·|h) on  h. A  belief  system 
μ  is  a  list  of  such probability  distributions,  one  for each  information  set. 
Recall  also  that  a mixed  strategy σ i  of  a  player  i  is  a  complete  contingent  plan  that 
maps  each  information  set h  of  player  i  to a mixed  action σ i  (·|h) that  is  available  at h. 
An  assessment  is  a  pair  (σ , μ) of  a  strategy  proﬁle  σ  and  a  system  of  beliefs  μ. 

Deﬁnition  38  An  assessment  (σ , μ)  is  sequentially  rational  if  at  each  information  set 
h, playing  according  to  σ i(h)  in  the  continuation  game  is  a  best  response  for  i (h)  to 
belief  μ (·|h)  and  the  belief  that  the  other  players  wil l  play  according  to  σ−i(h)  in  the 
continuation  game,  i.e.,  for  any  strategy  σ 0i(h) , 
Z 
Z
ui (σ 0i , σ−i) dμ (·|h) . 
ui  (σ i , σ−i ) dμ (·|h) ≥ 
For  example,  in Figure  9.1,  for  player  2,  given  any  belief  μ, L  yields 

· 
U2  (L; μ) = 1 μ (T | {T , B}) + 3 μ (B | {T , B})
·

while R  yields 

· 
U2 (R; μ) = 2 μ (T | {T , B}) + 5 μ (B | {T , B}) .
·
Hence,  sequential  rationality  requires  that  player  2  plays  R.  Given  player  2  plays  R, 
the  only  best  reply  for  player  1  is  T.  Therefore,  for  any  belief  assessment  μ, the  only 
sequentially  rational  strategy  proﬁle  is  (T , R).

Figure  9.2:  An  inconsistent  belief  assessment 

In  order  to  have  an  equilibrium,  we  also  need  to  require  that  μ  is  consistent  with 
σ .  Roughly  speaking,  consistency  requires  that  players  know  which  (possibly  mixed) 
strategies are played by the other players.  For a motivation, consider Figure 9.2 and call 
the node on the  left nT  and the node on  the  right nB , writing also h2  = {nT , nB } Given 
the  beliefs  μ (nT |h2 ) = 0.1  and  b (nB |h2 ) = 0.9, strategy  proﬁle  (T , R)  is  sequentially 
rational.  Strategy  T  is  a  best  response  to R.  To  check  the  sequential  rationality  for R, 
it  suﬃces to note that,  given  the  beliefs, L  yields 

while R  yields 

(.1) (10) + (.9) (3) = 3.7 

(.1) (2) + (.9) (5) = 4.7. 

(Note  that  there  is  no  continuation  game.)  But  (T , R)  is  not  even  a  Nash  equilibrium 
in  this  game.  This  is  because  in  a  Nash  equilibrium  player  knows  the  other  player’s 
strategy.  She would know that player 1 plays T , and hence she would assign probability 
1 on nT .  In  contrast,  according  to μ,  she  assigns only  probability  0.1  on nT . 
Therefore, as an equilibrium condition, one would also like to impose that the beliefs 
μ (h)  are  consistent  with  the  strategy  proﬁle  σ ,  in  that  the  beliefs  are  derived  from  σ 
using  Bayes’  rule.  That  is,  when  σ (h) > 0,  for  each  node  x ∈ h,  μ (x h) = σ (x) /σ (h),
| P 
where  σ (x)  is  the  probability  of  reaching  node  x  under  σ  and  σ (h) = 
x∈h σ (x). For 
example,  in  order a  belief  assessment  μ  to  be  consistent with  (T , R), we need 
Pr (nT | (T , R)) 
= 1.
Pr (nT | (T , R)) + Pr (nB | (T , R))

Unfortunately,  in general,  there can be  information  sets  that are not  supposed  to be 
reached  according  to  the  strategy  proﬁle,  i.e.,  σ (h) = 0.  In  that  case,  Bayes’  rule  does 
not  apply,  and  conditional  beliefs  are  arbitrary.  For  such  information  sets,  we  perturb 
the  strategy  proﬁle  slightly,  by  assuming  that  players  may  "tremble",  and  apply  the 
Bayes  rule  using  the  perturbed  strategy  proﬁle.  To  see  the  general  idea,  consider  the 
game in Figure 9.3.  The information set of player 3 is oﬀ the path of the strategy proﬁle 
(X, T , L).  Hence,  we  cannot  apply  the  Bayes  rule.  But  we  can  still  see  that  the  beliefs 
the  ﬁgure  are  inconsistent.  Let  us  perturb  the  strategies  of  players  1  and  2  assuming 
that  players  1  and  2  tremble  with  probabilities  ε1  and  ε2 ,  respectively,  where  ε1  and 
ε2  are  small  but  positive  numbers.  That  is,  we  put  probability  ε1  on  E  and  1 − ε1  on 
X  (instead  of  0  and  1,  respectively)  and  1 − ε2  on  T  and  ε2  on  B  (instead  of  1  and  0, 
respectively).  Under  the  perturbed beliefs, 

ε1 (1 − ε2) 
= 1 − ε2 ,
Pr (nT  h3 , ε1 , ε2) = 
|
ε1 (1 − ε2 ) + ε1ε2 
where  nT  is  the node that follows  T , and  h3  is  the  information  set  Player  3  moves. 
As  ε2  →  0,  Pr (nT |h3 , ε1 , ε2 )  →  1.  Therefore,  for  consistency,  we  need  μ (nT |h3 ) = 1. 
Formally,  consistency  is  deﬁned  as  follows. 

Deﬁnition  39  An assessment  (σ , μ) is  consistent  if  there  exists  a  sequence  (σm , μm) of 
assessment  converging  to  (σ , μ) such  that  for  each m, 

•	 σm  is completely mixed (i.e.  σ i
m 
(h)  (a|h) > 0 for every h and every action a available 
at  h), 

•	 and  μm (·|h) is  derived  from  σm  using Bayes’  rule  at  each  h:

σm (x)

μm (x|h) =
∀x ∈ h. 
σm (h) 

Deﬁnition  40  A sequential equilibrium is a sequential ly rational and consistent assess-
ment. 

Example  4  In  the  game  in  Figure  9.3,  the  unique  subgame-perfect  equilibrium  is  s∗  = 
(E , T , R).  Let  us  check  that  (s∗ , μ∗ )  where  μ∗ (nT |h3 ) = 1  is  a  perfect  Bayesian  Nash 
equilibrium.  We  need  to  check  that

At  the  information  set  of  player  3,  given  μ∗ (nT |h3 ) = 1, action  L  yields  1  while 
R  yields  3,  and  hence  R  is  sequential ly  rational.  At  the  information  set  of  player  2, 
given  the  other  strategies,  T  and  B  yield  3  and  1,  respectively,  and  hence  playing  T
