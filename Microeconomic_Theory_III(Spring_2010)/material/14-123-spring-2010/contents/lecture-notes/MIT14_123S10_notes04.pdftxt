Attitudes  Towards  Risk 

In  the  previous  lecture,  we  explored  the  implications  of  expected  utility maximization. 
In  this  lecture,  considering  the  lotteries  over  money,  I  will  introduce  the  basic  notions 
regarding  risk,  such  as  risk  aversion  and  certainty  equivalence.  Understanding  these 
concepts  is  essential  to  follow most  areas  in modern  economics. 

4.1  Theory 

Take the set of alternatives as X  = R which corresponds the wealth level of the decision 
maker.  The  decision  maker  has  an  increasing  von  Neumann-Morgenstern  utility  func-
tion u : R
R,  representing his preferences  over  the  lotteries  on his wealth  level.  I will 
→ 
assume  that  u  is  diﬀerentiable  whenever  needed.  Since  we  have  a  continuum  of  conse-
quences, it is more convenient to represent lotteries by cumulative distribution functions 
[0, 1]. I write  f  for  the  density  of  F  when  it  exists.  The  expected  utility  of  F
→ 
F  : X 
is  given  by 
Z 
U (F ) ≡ EF  (u) ≡ 
where EF  is  the  expectation  operator  under F .  The  expected wealth  level under F  is 
Z 
By  comparing  EF  (x)  to  EF  (u),  one  can  learn  about  the  decision  maker’s  attitudes 
towards  risk. 

u (x) dF  (x) , 

EF  (x) = 

xdF  (x) .

CHAPTER 4.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS RISK 

A decision maker is called risk  averse  if he always prefers sure wealth level EF  (x) to 
the  lottery F , i.e., 

EF  (u) ≤ u (EF  (x)) 
(∀F ) . 
He  is  called  strictly  risk  averse  if  the  inequality  is  always  strict  for  nondegenerate  lot-
teries.  He is called  risk  neutral  if  he  is  always  indiﬀerent: 

EF  (u) = u (EF  (x)) 

(∀F ) . 
Finally, he is called risk  seeking  (or risk loving) if he prefers lottery to the sure outcome, 
i.e., 

EF  (u) ≥ u (EF  (x)) 
(∀F ) . 
Clearly,  by  Jensen’s  inequality,  which  you  must  know  by  now,  risk  aversion  corre-
sponds  to  the  concavity  of  the  utility  function: 

•  DM  is  risk  averse  if  and  only  if  u  is  concave; 
•  he  is  strictly  risk  averse  if  and  only  if  u  is  strictly  concave; 
•  he  is  risk  neutral  if  and  only  if  u  is  linear,  and 
•  he  is  risk  seeking  if  and  only  if  u  is  convex. 

Another  way  to  assess  the  attitudes  towards  risk  is  certainty  equivalence.  The  cer-
tainty  equivalent  of  a  lottery  F ,  denoted  by  CE (F ),  is  a  sure  wealth  level  that  yields 
the  same  expected utility  as F . That  is, 

CE (F ) = u−1 (U (F )) = u−1 (EF  (u)) . 

It  is  immediate  from  the  deﬁnitions  that 

•  DM  is  risk  averse  if  and  only  if CE (F ) ≤ EF  (x)  for  all  F ; 
•  he  is  risk  neutral  if  and  only  if CE (F ) = EF  (x)  for  all  F , and 
•  he  is  risk  seeking  if  and  only  if CE (F ) ≥ EF  (x)  for  all  F . 

4.1.  THEORY 

35 

It is sometimes useful to quantify the degree of risk aversion.  There are two important 
measures  of  risk  aversion.  The  ﬁrst  one  is  absolute  risk  aversion : 

rA (x) = −u00  (x) /u0  (x) , 
which  is  also  called  Arrow-Pratt  coeﬃcient  of  absolute  risk  aversion.  Note  that  u00 
measures  the  concavity  of  the  utility  function,  while  u0  normalizes  the  concavity  as  the 
utility  representation  is  unique  up  to  aﬃne  transformations. 
A  convenient  assumption  in  economic  analysis  is  constant  absolute  risk  aversion 
(CARA). A CARA utility  function  takes  the  simple  form  of 

u (x) = −e−αx , 
where  α  is  the  coeﬃcient  of  absolute  risk  aversion.  This  utility  function  becomes  espe-
cially convenient when the  lotteries are distributed normally.  In that case,  the certainty 
equivalent  becomes 

1 
CE (F ) = μ −  ασ2 
2 
where  μ  and  σ2  are  the  mean  and  the  variance  of  the  distribution,  respectively.  While 
CARA  is  a  convenient  assumption,  some  may  ﬁnd  it  more  plausible  that  absolute  risk 
aversion is decreasing with wealth level (DARA), so that richer people take higher risks. 
Indeed,  some may want to normalize the amount of  risk aversion with respect to the 
level  of  wealth.  This  leads  to  the  concept  of  relative  risk  aversion. The  coeﬃcient  of 
relative  risk  aversion  is 

rR (x) = −xu00  (x) /u0 (x) . 
The  constant  relative  risk  aversion  (CRRA)  utility  function  takes  the  form of 

u (x) = −x 1−ρ/ (1 − ρ) , 
where  ρ  is  the  coeﬃcient  of  constant  relative  risk  aversion.  When  ρ  = 1,  it is the  log 
utility  function:  u (x) = log (x). 
Using the above concepts, one can also compare the attitudes of two decision makers 
towards  risk.  To  this  end,  take  any  two decision makers DM1  and DM2 with  u1  and u2 
1 (EF  (ui )) and  rA,i  = −ui00/u0i  for  the  certainty  equivalent  and 
and  write  CEi  (F ) ≡  u−i 
coeﬃcient  of  absolute  risk  aversion under  ui  for  i ∈ {1, 2}. 

36 

CHAPTER 4.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS RISK 

Deﬁnition  11  DM1  is more risk averse  than DM2  if either of  the equivalent conditions 
in  the  next  proposition  holds. 

Proposition  3  The fol lowing  are equivalent. 

1.  u1  = g u2  for  some  concave  function  g,
◦ 
2.  CE1 (F ) ≤ CE2 (F )  for  every  F ; 
3.  rA,1  ≥ rA,2  everywhere. 
Proof.  Since  both  u1  and  u2  are  increasing,  there  exists  an  increasing  function  g  such 
that  u1  =  g
u2 .  To  see  the  equivalence  between  1  and  2,  note  that  CE1 (F ) =
◦ 
u−1 (g−1 (EF  (g (u2 )))).  By  Jensen’s  inequality,  g  is  concave  if  and  only  if  EF  (g (u2 )) ≤
2 
g (EF  (u2 ))  for  every F . Thus,  g  is  concave  if  and  only  for  every F , 
1 ¡g−1 (EF  (g (u2 ))) ¢ 
CE1 (F ) =  u−2
1 ¡g−1 (g (EF  (u2 ))) ¢ 
u−2
≤ 
=  CE2 (F ) , 
where  the  inequality  uses  also  the  fact  that  g−1  is  increasing. 
To  see  the  equivalence  between  1  and  3,  note  that 

1 (EF  (u2 ))
= u−2

u001 
rA,1  = − u01 

= −

g 00u02  + g 0u002 
g 0u02 

u200
= − u20 − 

g 00 
g 0  = rA,2  − 

g 00 
g 0  . 

Hence, 

g 00  = g 0  (rA,2  − rA,1 ) .
· 
Thus,  rA,1  ≥ rA,2  everywhere  if  and  only  if  g 00  ≤ 0  everywhere, which  is  true  if  and  only 
if  g  is  concave. 
Since one can envision and individual with two diﬀerent initial wealths as two diﬀerent 
decision  makers,  the  above  characterization  allows  one  to  explore  how  one’s  attitude 
towards risk changes as his initial wealth level changes.  To do this,  let us write w  for the 
initial wealth level of an individual and write lotteries as changes in his wealth.  That  is, 
given  any  lottery  z , the  ﬁnal wealth  of  the  individual  is  x = w + z . Deﬁne  u (·|w)  by 
u (z |w) = u (z + w) . 

4.2.  APPLICATIONS 

37 

The  coeﬃcient  of  absolute  risk  aversion under  initial wealth w0  is 

rA  (z |w) = −u00  (z + w) /u0  (z + w) = rA  (z + w) . 
Corollary  1  The  decision  maker  becomes  less  risk  averse  against  the  changes  in  his 
wealth  (z )  when  his  initial  wealth  increases  if  and  only  if  he  has  decreasing  absolute  risk 
aversion. 

Proof.  By  Proposition  3,  it  suﬃces  to  show  that  rA (·|w)  is  decreasing  in  w  (i.e. 
rA (·|w 0)  ≤  rA (·|w)  whenever  w 0  ≥  w) if and  only  if  rA  is  decreasing.  But  this  is 
immediate  because  rA (z |w) = rA (z − w) by  deﬁnition. 
One can  further  conclude  that  if  the  decision maker  has  constant  absolute  risk  aver-
sion,  then  his  attitude  toward  the  risk  in  changes  in  his wealth  ( z)  is  independent  of  his 
initial  wealth. 
Similar facts can be obtained about the decision maker’s attitudes toward the risk in 
multiplication of his wealth, using  relative  risk aversion  instead.  To do  that, write y  for 
the  multiplication  of  his  initial  wealth  so  that  his  ﬁnal  wealth  level  is  x  = yw. Deﬁne 
uy  (·|w) by 

uy  (z |w) = u (yw) . 
The  coeﬃcient  of  absolute  risk  aversion  against  y  under  initial wealth w  is 

rA,y  (z |w) = −uy00 (y |w) /uy0 (y |w) = −w0u00  (yw) /u0  (yw) = rR  (yw) . 

Hence, 

Corollary  2  DM’s  risk  aversion against  the multiplication  y  in  his wealth  is decreasing 
in his  initial wealth w0  if  he  has  decreasing  relative  risk  aversion  rR ; DM’s  risk  aversion 
against  the multiplication  y  in his wealth  is  independent of  his  initial wealth w0  if  he  has 
constant  relative  risk  aversion  rR . 

4.2  Applications 

4.2.1  Insurance 

Consider a decision maker who has  initial wealth of w  and may  lose 1 unit of his wealth 
with probability p.  He can buy an insurance, which is a divisible good.  A unit insurance 

38 

CHAPTER 4.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS RISK 

costs  q  and  covers  one unit  of  loss  in  case of  a  loss.  We want  to understand his demand 
for  insurance.  Let  λ  be  the  amount  of  insurance  he  buys.  His  expected utility  is 

U (λ) = u (w − qλ) (1 − p) + u (w − qλ − (1 − λ)) p. 

First  consider  the  case  of  actuarially  unfair  price  q > p, which  is  natural  given  that  the 
insurance  company  needs  to  cover  its  operational  costs.  In  that  case,  he  buys  only  a 
partial  insurance,  i.e.,  λ < 1.  Indeed, 

U 0 (1) = (p (1 − q) − q (1 − p)) u0  (w − q) < 0, 
i.e.,  U  is  strictly  increasing  at  the  full  insurance  level,  and  hence  optimal  λ  must  be 
less  than  1.  Therefore,  he  bears  some  of  the  risks  no  matter  how  risk  averse  he  is  and 
how  low  the mark  up  q − p  is.  This  is  because  when  the  amount  of  risk  gets  lower  and 
lower,  u  becomes  approximately  linear  and  the  decision  maker  becomes  approximately 
risk  neutral. 
Now  consider  the  case  of  q  =  p,  the  actuarially  fair  price.  This  case  is  important 
in  the  literature  because  it  corresponds  to  the  competitive  price  (assuming  insurance 
companies do not have any other costs).  In that case, he buys full insurance (i.e.  λ = 1). 
To  see  this, note  that under actuarially  fair price,  his  expected wealth  is Eλ  [x] = w − q 
for  each  λ.  Hence,  for  any λ < 1, 

CE (λ) < Eλ  [x] = w − q = CE (1) , 

where  CE (λ)  is  the  certainty  equivalent  of  wealth  when  he  buys  λ  units  of  insurance. 
Thus,  λ = 1  yields  higher  certainty  equivalence  than  any  other λ. 
Finally,  consider  a more  risk  averse  decision maker with  certainty  equivalence  oper-
ator CE 0 .  If  the  former decision maker buys  full  insurance,  so will  the new one.  Indeed, 
for  any  λ < 1, 

CE 0  (λ) ≤ CE (λ) < CE (1) = CE 0  (1) , 
where the ﬁrst inequality is the fact that the new decision maker is more risk averse, the 
second  inequality  is  by  the  fact  that  full  insurance was  optimal  for  the  original  decision 
maker  and  the  equality  is  by  the  fact  that  there  is  no  risk  under  full  insurance.

4.2.2  Optimal  Portfolio  Choice 

U (α) = 

Consider  a  decision maker with  initial  wealth  w.  There  is  also  a  risky  asset  that  yields 
z  for  each  dollar  invested.  Write  F  for  the  cdf  of  z .  We want  to  understand  how much 
the  decision  maker  would  invest  in  the  risky  asset.  Write  α  for  the  level  of  investment 
and α∗  for  the  optimal  α.  The  expected  utility  is 
Z 
u (w + α (z − 1)) dF, 
which  is  a  concave  function.  The  optimal  investment  is  determined  by  the  ﬁrst-order 
condition 
Z 
u0  (w + α∗ (z − 1)) (z − 1) dF  = 0. 
First observe that he will not take any risk if the expected return E [z ]− 1 is not positive. 
Indeed,  if E [z ] − 1 ≤ 0, 
Z 
u0  (w) (z − 1) dF  = u0  (w) (E [z ] − 1) ≤ 0. 
U 0  (0) = 
On  the  other  hand,  he  will  invest  a  positive  amount  as  long  as  any  positive  expected 
return  (E [z ] − 1 > 0): 

U 0  (α∗ ) = 

U 0  (0) = u0  (w) (E [z ] − 1) > 0. 
This  is,  again,  because  he  is  approximately  risk  neutral  against  small  risks. 
A main  ﬁnding  in  this  example  is  that  more  risk  averse  agents  invest  less  in  the 
risky  asset.  I  will  show  this  intuitive  fact  formally  next.  Consider  two  decision makers 
DM1  and  DM2  with  utility  functions  u1  and  u2 ,  respectively,  such  that  DM1  is  more 
risk  averse  than  DM2.  Hence,  u1  =  g u2  for  some  concave  increasing  function  g  with 
◦ 
g 0 (w) = 1.  Denote  the  variables  for  decision  maker  i  by  subscript  i,  e.g.,  by  writing 
α∗ 
1  and  α∗ 
2  for  the  optimal  investments  of  DM1  and  DM2,  respectively.  Now,  for  any 
α, since  u01 (w + α (z − 1))  =  g 0  (w + α (z − 1)) u20 (w + α (z − 1)),  u10 (w + α (z − 1))  ≥ 
u0 (w + α (z − 1)) if and only if z ≤ 1.  Hence, [u0 (w + α (z − 1)) − u0 (w + α (z − 1))] (z − 1) ≤
2 
2 
1
0  everywhere.  Thus,  for  every α, 
Z 
[u01 (w + α (z − 1)) − u02 (w + α (z − 1))] (z − 1) dF  ≤ 0.
U 0 (α) − U 0 (α) = 
2 
1
1  ≤  α2∗ .  (One  way  to  see  this  is  to  observe  that  U10 (α∗ 
Therefore,  α∗ 
2 )  ≤  U20 (α∗ 
2) = 0. 
Hence, U1  is  decreasing  at α∗ 
2  and must  have  been maximized  at  a  lower  value.)

CHAPTER 4.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS RISK 

Together with Corollary 1,  the above ﬁnding yields  the  following monotone compar-
ative  statics  on  the  optimal  investment  level  as  a  function  of  initial wealth: 

•	 if  the  agent  has  decreasing  absolute  risk  aversion,  then  α∗  is  increasing  with  the 
initial wealth  level w; 

•	 if  the  agent  has  constant  absolute  risk  aversion,  then  α∗  is  independent  of  the 
initial wealth  level w. 

The optimal  level of  investment as a proportion of the initial wealth is related to the 
relative risk aversion.  To see this, write β  = α/w, and observe that the ﬁnal wealth level 
is 

x = w + βw (z − 1) = w (1 + β (z − 1)) .
·
Hence,  the  risk  is  about  the multiplication  1 + β (z − 1)  of  his  initial  wealth.  From  the 
above  ﬁnding  and Corollary  2, we  can  conclude  following: 

•	 If  DM  has  decreasing  relative  risk  aversion,  then  the  optimal  investment  level  β ∗ 
as  a  proportion  of  the  initial wealth w  is  increasing  in w; 

•	 If DM has  constant  relative  risk  aversion,  then  the  optimal  investment  level  β ∗  as 
a  proportion  of  the  initial  wealth  w  is  independent  of  w;  i.e.  α∗  =  bw  for  some 
constant  b. 

4.2.3  Optimal  Risk  Sharing 

Consider  a  set  of  agents  N  =  {1, . . . , n}. Each  i  has  a  concave,diﬀerentiable,  and 
bounded utility  function ui .  There  is  an unknown  state  s ∈ S . Each agent  i  has  a  risky 
asset  x¯i  :  S 
R,  whose  outcome  depends  on  the  state.  A  feasible  allocation  is  a  list 
→ 
(x1 , . . . , x )  of  consumption plans  xi  : S  R  such  that 
→ 
n	
x1 (s) +  + xn  (s) ≤ x¯1 (s) +  + ¯xn (s)	
· · ·	
· · ·
for  each  s.  We want  to  explore  the Pareto-optimal  allocations.  To  this  end, write A  for 
the  set  of  all  feasible  allocations.  Note  that A  is  a  convex  set.  Write  also 

(4.1) 

V  = {(E (u1 (x1)) , . . . , E (un (xn))) | (x1 , . . . , xn) ∈ A}

for  the  set  of  feasible  utility  vectors  and  V¯ =  {v |v ≤ v 0  for  some  v 0  ∈ V }  for  the  com-
prehensive  closure  of V .  Note that since  each ui  is  concave  and A  is  convex,  V¯ is  also a 
convex  set. 
Now  consider  any  Pareto-optimal  allocation  x∗  = (x1∗ , . . . , x∗ 
n). By  deﬁnition,  the 
utility  vector  (E (u1 (x1∗ )) , . . . , E (un  (xn∗ )))  is  on  the Pareto-frontier  of  the  set  V¯ . Since 
V¯ is  convex,  (E (u1 (x1∗ )) , . . . , E (un (xn∗ )))  is  a  solution  to  the  program 
P 
P
λivi  =  max

That  is,  the  Pareto-optimal  risk  sharing  allocations  can  be  written  as  a  maximization 
of  weighted  sum  of  utilities  at  each  state  where  the  utility  weight  of  individuals  are 
independent  of  the  state.  While  it  is  possible  to  compensate  one  individual  for  his 
loss  in  one  state  by  using  a  higher  utility  weight  in  another  state,  the  above  ﬁnding 
establishes  that  such  a  compensation  is  not  Pareto  optimal.  The  optimality  requires 
that we determine  the  allocation  of  the  consumption at  each  state  independent  of what 
allocation would have  been  in  another  state. 
Now  suppose  that  x¯i  ∼  N (¯μi , σ 2 
i )  and  ( ¯x1 , . . . , x¯n)  are  stochastically  independent. 
Assume also  that  the agents have constant absolute  risk aversion:  ui (x) = −e−αi x . The 
above analysis implies that in any Pareto-optimal allocation x∗  each agent i owns a share 
λi,j  in  each  asset  x¯j  in  addition  to  a  constant  consumption  level  that  add  up  to  zero. 
To  see  this, note  that we can transfer payoﬀs  in  terms of  certainty equivalences because 
CEi  (xi) = E [xi ] − V ar (xi ) αi/2 when xi  is normal.  That is, we have transferable utility 
in CE  space.  Hence, Pareto optimality  requires  that x∗  is  a  solution  to
