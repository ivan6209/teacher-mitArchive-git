Reputation  Formation 

In a complete information game,  it is assumed that the players know exactly what other 
players’ payoﬀs are.  In real life this assumption almost never holds.  What would happen 
in equilibrium  if a player has a  small amount of doubt about  the other player’s payoﬀs? 
It  turns  out  that  in  dynamic  games  such  small  changes  may  have  profound  eﬀects  on 
the  equilibrium behavior.  In  particular, when  the  game  is  long  and  players  are  patient, 
the  players’  concern  regarding  forming  a  reputation  for  having  an  advantageous  payoﬀ 
function  overwhelms  all  the  other  concerns,  altering  equilibrium  behavior  dramatically. 
Kreps  and Wilson  (1982)  and Milgrom  and  Roberts  (1982)  have  illustrated  this  on  ex-
amples,  such as centipede game and chain-store paradox.  The analysis  is extended  later 
to more general repeated games, most notably by Fudenberg and Levine.  In this lecture, 
I will illustrate the basic idea on the centipede game.  I will start with a simple example, 
which  also  illustrates  how  one  computes  a mixed-strategy  sequential  equilibrium. 

10.1  A  Simple  Example 

Consider  the  game  in  Figure  10.1.  In  this  game,  Player  2  does  not  know  the  payoﬀs of 
Player  1.  She  thinks  at  the  beginning  that  his  payoﬀs are  as  in  the upper  branch  with 
high  probability  0.9,  but  she  also  assigns  the  small  probability  of  0.1  to  the  possibility 
that  he  is  averse  to  play  down,  exiting  the  game.  The  ﬁrst  type  of  player  1  is  called 
"normal"  type,  and  the  second  type  of  player  1  is  called  the  "crazy"  type.  If  it  were 
common knowledge that player 1 is "normal", then backwards induction would yield the

following:  player 1 goes down  in  the  last decision node; player 2 goes across,  and player 
1  goes  down in the  ﬁrst  node. 

What  happens  in  the  incomplete  information  game,  in  which  the  above  common 
knowledge  assumption  is  relaxed?  By  sequential  rationality,  the  "crazy"  type  (in  the 
lower  branch)  always  goes  across.  In  the  last  decision  node,  the  normal  type  again 
goes  down.  Can  it  be  the  case  that  the  normal  type  goes  down  in  his  ﬁrst  decision 
node,  as  in  the  complete  information  case?  It  turns  out  that  the  answer  is  No.  If 
in  a  sequential  equilibrium  "normal"  type  goes  down  in  the  ﬁrst  decision  node,  in  her 
information  set,  player  2  must  assign  probability  1  to  the  crazy  type.  (By  Bayes  rule, 
Pr (crazy |across) = 0.1/ (0.1 + (.9) (0))  =  1.  This  is  required  for  consistency.)  Given 
this  belief  and  the  actions  that  we  have  already  determined,  she  gets  -5  from  going 
across  and  2  from  going  down,  and  she  must  go  down  for  sequential  rationality.  But 
then  "normal"  type  should  go  across  as  a  best  reply,  which  contradicts  the  assumption 
that  he  goes  down. 

Similarly,  one  can  also  show  that  there  is  no  sequential  equilibrium  in  which  the 
normal  type  goes  across  with  probability  1.  If  that  were  the  case,  then  by  consistency, 
player 2 would assign 0.9 to normal type in her information set.  Her best response would 
be  to  go  across  for  sure,  and  in  that  case  the  normal  type  would  prefer  to  go  down  in 
the  ﬁrst  node. 

In any sequential equilibrium, normal type must mix in his ﬁrst decision node.  Write 

10.1.  A SIMPLE EXAMPLE 

105 

α  = Pr (across|normal) and  β  for  the  probability  of  going  across  for  player  2.  Write 
also  μ  for  the  probability  player  2  assigns  to  the  upper  node  (the  normal  type)  in  her 
information  set.  Since  normal  type  mixes  (i.e.  0  < α <  1),  he  is  indiﬀerent.  Across 
yields 

3β + 5 (1 − β ) 
while  down  yields  4.  Therefore,  it must  be  that  3β + 5 (1 − β ) = 4,  i.e. 
β = 1/2. 

Since  0 < β <  1,  player  2  must  be  indiﬀerent  between  going  down,  which  yields  2  for 
sure,  and  going  across, which  yields  the  expected  payoﬀ  of 

3μ + (−5) (1 − μ) = 8μ − 5. 

That  is,  8μ − 5 = 2, and 

μ = 7/8. 

But  this belief must be  consistent: 

Therefore,

= μ = 

0.9α 
. 
0.9α + .1 

α = 7/9. 

This  completes  the computation of  the unique  sequential equilibrium, which  is depicted 
in Figure  10.2. 

Exercise  15  Check  that  the  pair  of  mixed  strategy  proﬁle  and  the  belief  assessment  is 
indeed  a  sequential  equilibrium. 

Notice that in sequential equilibrium, after observing that player 1 goes across, player 
2 increases her probability for player 1 being a crazy type who will go across all the way, 
from 0.1 to 0.125.  If she assigned 0 probability to that type at the beginning,  she would 
not  change  her  beliefs  after  she  observes  that  he  goes  across.  In  the  latter  case,  player 
1  could  never  convince  her  that  he  will  go  across  (no  matter  how  many  times  he  goes 
across),  and  he  would  not  try.  When  that  probability  is  positive  (no matter  how  small 
it  is),  she  increases  her  probability  of  him  being  crazy  after  she  sees  him  going  across, 
and player 1 would  try going  across with  some  probability  even he  is  not  crazy.

Exercise  16  In  the  above  game,compute  the  sequential  equilibrium  for  any  initial  prob-

10.2  Reputation  in  Centipede  Game 

Consider  the  perfect-information  game  depicted  in  Figure  10.3.  In  this  game,  there  are 
two  players  in  a  relationship.  The  players  alternatingly  get  an  opportunity  to  end  the 
relationship  and  get  extra  payoﬀ  in  the  expense  of  the  other  player.  Staying  in  the 
relationship  is  beneﬁcial  for  each  player,  so  that  a  player  would  like  to  remain  in  the 

10.2.  REPUTATION  IN CENTIPEDE GAME 

107 

relationship if she knows that the other player will stay in the relationship in the following 
period.  If  the  other  player  breaks  up  in  the  next  period,  however,  she  would  lose  from 
staying in for another period.  In particular, she loses 1 unit if the other player breaks up 
in  the  next  period  and  gains  1  unit  if  the  other  players  remains  in  the  relationship  and 
she breaks up two  periods later.  As it is seen in the  ﬁgure,  players’  payoﬀs  accumulate 
to  large  numbers  if  they  stay  in  the  game  for  a  long while. 
Unfortunately,  however,  backwards  induction  leads  to  a  unique  outcome:  player  1 
breaks  up  in  the  ﬁrst  period,  yielding  a  low  payoﬀ  of  1 to each player.  In  the very last 
period, player 2 goes down.  Knowing  this,  in  the period before  the  last period, player 1 
goes  down,  in  order  to  avoid  a  unit  loss  from player  2’s  breaking  up  in  the  next  period. 
Knowing  this,  in  the  previous  period,  player  2  goes down,  and  so  on. 

Exercise  17  Show  that  there  is  a  unique  Nash  equilibrium  outcome  in  the  centipede 
game  above. 

Despite  the  simplicity  of  the  argument,  the  backwards  induction  outcome  is  para-
doxical for many.  There is a feeling that one should try and see whether the other player 
stay in the game given the high payoﬀs later in the game.  Kreps and Wilson have shown 
that  the  argument  is  indeed  very  fragile  with  respect  to  incomplete  information.  They 
introduce a small amount of  information in such a way that  in the resulting incomplete-
information  game  there  is  a  unique  sequential  equilibrium,  and  in  that  equilibrium  the 
players  remain  in  the  game until  near  the  end  of  the  game and  start mixing  thereafter. 
I will present their analysis in great detail.  Beforehand, I want to emphasize that the 
backwards induction argument heavily relies on the assumption that the payoﬀs and the 
rationality  of  the  players  is  mutually  known  at  high  orders,  i.e.,  everybody  knows  that 
the payoﬀs are as in the ﬁgure, everybody knows that everybody knows that the payoﬀs 
are as in the ﬁgure . . .  up to very high orders.  In the last period, Player 2 goes down by 
his  rationality  alone.  In  the  previous  period,  Player  1  goes  down  not  only  because  his 
payoﬀs are  as  in  the  ﬁgure  but  also  because  he  knows  that Player  2  is  rational  and  her 
payoﬀs are  as  in  the  ﬁgure.  In  two  periods  before  the  end,  Player  2  goes  down  because 
she is rational and her payoﬀs are as in the ﬁgure and she knows that player 1 is rational 
with  the payoﬀs in  the ﬁgure  and will  remain  to  know  that Player  2  is  rational  and has 
the  payoﬀ  in  the  ﬁgure.  Likewise,  Player  1  goes  down  in  the  ﬁrst period because he is 
rational  knows  that  Player  2  is  rational  and  that  Player  2  will  remain  to  believe  that

Figure  10.4:  Centipede Game with Doubt 

Player  1  is  rational  and  that  ...  up  to  198  iterations.  When  the  higher-order  beliefs 
are  not  as  in  the  model,  players’  behavior  will  not  look  like  the  one  prescribed  by  the 
backwards  induction  applied  to  the model. 

Kreps  and  Wilson  consider  the  incomplete-information  game  in  Figure  10.4.  Now, 
Player  2  is  not  certain  that  Player  1’s  payoﬀs  are  as  in  the  centipede  game.  She  does 
assign very high probability  on  the  event  that Player 1’s  payoﬀs  are  as  in  the  centipede 
game.  She  thinks,  however,  that  with  the  small  probability  of  0.001,  Player  2  may  be 
averse  to  exiting  the  relationship.  This  situation  is  modeled  by  using  two  types  for 
Player  2.  With  probability  0.999,  Player  1  is  of  "normal"  type,  with  payoﬀs as in the 
original  centipede  game,  and  with  probability  0.001,  he  is  of  "crazy"  type  who  gets  -1 
from  exiting  and  0  from not  exiting. 

Although  the  latter probability  is  small, when  she observes  that Player 1  remains  in 
the  game,  Player  2  may  update  her  belief  and  assign  a  higher  probability  to  the  crazy 
type.  In particular, if she expects that the normal type plays as in the original centipede 
game,  then  after  observing  that  Player  1  remains  in  the  game,  she  becomes  convinced 
that Player  1  is  of  crazy  type  (assigning  probability  1  on  the  crazy  type).  In  that  case, 
her  best  response would  be  to  remain  in  the  game  until  the  very  end.  Of  course,  if  this 

10.2.  REPUTATION  IN CENTIPEDE GAME 

109 

were  the  equilibrium  strategy,  then  the  normal  type  of  the  player  1 would  remain  until 
his  last  decision  node,  leading  to  a  contradiction.  That  is,  the  normal  type  must  go 
across  with  positive  probability  in  the  ﬁrst  period.  Indeed,  as  I  mentioned  before,  in 
sequential  equilibrium he  goes  across  all  the way  to his  last  decision  node with positive 
probability. 
To  compute  the  sequential  equilibrium,  denote  the  nodes  with  respect  to  how  far 
they are  from the end of  the game, by writing n = 1 for  the  last period  (where Player 2 
moves),  n = 2 for  the  period  before  the  last  period  (where  Player  1 moves),  and  so  on, 
as  in the ﬁgure.  I will develop the argument as small steps, which are stated as lemmas. 
The  ﬁrst  observation  is  that  the  crazy  type  must  go  across  with  probability  1  at  all  of 
his  information  sets: 

Lemma  3  In  any  sequential  equilibrium,  the  crazy  type  plays  across  with  probability  1 
at  every  information  set  Player  1  moves. 

Indeed,  at  any  information  set,  the  crazy  type  gets  0  from  exiting  and  1  from never 
exiting, and hence by sequential  rationality of  the "crazy" type at  the node, he must go 
across with  probability  1.  This  further  implies  that  Player  2  never  exits  for  sure  before 
the  last  period: 

Lemma  4  In  any  sequential  equilibrium,  Player  2  plays  across  with  positive  probability 
at  every  information  set  of  her  with  n > 1. 

Proof.  Suppose  that  the  lemma  is  false  and  let  ˆ
the 
n >  1  be  the  largest  node  (i.e. 
earliest  period)  at  which  Player  2  goes  down  with  probability  1.  Then,  by  sequential 
rationality,  in  the  previous  period  (i.e.  at  nˆ + 1),  the normal  type must go down with 
probability  1.  This  is  because  going  down  yields  1  unit  more  payoﬀ  than  going  across 
and  letting  Player  2 goes down.  But note that the  information set  nˆ of  Player  2  is 
reached  with  positive  probability  as  both  Player  2  and  the  crazy  type  of  player  1  go 
across  until  information  set  nˆ .  Hence,  by  consistency,  Player  2 must  assign  probability 
1 on the  crazy type at  nˆ .  In  that  case,  by  sequential  rationality  of  Player  2  at  node  nˆ , 
she must  go  across with  probability  1,  a  contradiction. 
Lemmas 3 and 4 immediately imply that all of Player 2’s information sets are reached: 

110 

CHAPTER 10.  REPUTATION FORMATION 

Lemma  5  In  any  sequential  equilibrium,  every  information  set  of  Player  2  is  reached 
with  positive  probability. 

By the argument in the proof of Lemma 4, this implies that the normal type of Player 
1  also  plays  across with positive  probability: 

Lemma  6  In  any  sequential  equilibrium,  the  normal  type  Player  1  plays  across  with 
positive  probability  at  every  information  set  with  n > 2. 

Proof.  If  the  normal  type  plays  down  with  probability  1  at  n, then  at  n − 1, which  is 
reached  with  positive  probability  by  Lemma  5,  Player  2  assigns  probability  1  to  crazy 
type.  If  n − 1 > 1,  she  then  goes  across  at  n − 1  with  probability  1.  In  that  case,  the 
normal  type  of  player  1  plays  across with  probability  1  at  n. 
We  have  so  far  seen  that,  in  any  sequential  equilibrium,  all  types  of  all  players  go 
across  until  their  last  information  set  with  positive  probability.  This  contrasts  to  the 
equilibrium  in  the  complete-information  game,  in  which  each  player  exits  in  the  ﬁrst 
possible  opportunity.  The  above  arguments  further  implies  that  once  the  players  start 
mixing  as  opposed  to  going  across  for  sure,  they  keep mixing  until  the  end: 

Lemma  7  In  any  sequential  equilibrium,  if  Player  2  goes  across  with  probability  1  at 
her  information  set  n, then 

1.  the  normal  type  of  Player  1  goes  across  with  probability  1  at  n + 1, and 

2.  Player  2 goes across with probability  1 at  n + 2. 

Proof.  Part  1:  Given  that  Player  2  goes  across  with  probability  1  at  n, at  n + 1, the 
normal  type  of Player  1  has  the  option  of  going  across  and  exiting  at  n − 1. This move 
yields 1 units of payoﬀs more  than exiting at n + 1.  Hence, by  sequential  rationality, he 
goes  across with probability  1. 
Part  2:  By  part  1,  at  n + 2,  player  2  is  certain  that  player  1  will  go  across  with 
probability 1 at n + 1 (regardless of his type).  Hence, as  in the proof of Part 1,  she goes 
across with  probability  1. 
Since  all  types  go  across  with  positive  probability  until  the  end  (by  Lemmas  3,  4, 
and  6),  iterative  application  of Lemma  7  yields  the  following  cutoﬀ  strategies. 

10.2.  REPUTATION  IN CENTIPEDE GAME 

111 

Lemma  8  In  any  sequential  equilibrium,  there  exists  n∗  such  that 

1.  at any of his  information sets n,  the normal type of Player 1 goes across with prob-
ability 1 when n > n∗  and mixes  between  the  two actions with positive probabilities 
when  2 < n ≤ n∗ ; 
2.  at  any  of  her  information  sets  n, Player  2  goes  across with  probability  1 when n > 
n∗  and mixes  between  the  two  actions  with  positive  probabilities  when  1 < n ≤ n∗ , 
and 

3.  Player  2  assigns  probability  0.001  to  the  crazy  type  at  each  n ≥ n∗ . 
It therefore suﬃces to ﬁnd mixing probabilities and the cutoﬀ n∗ .  To that end, write 
μn  for  the  probability  Player  2  assigns  to  the  crazy  type  at  her  information  set  n,  pn 
for  the probability  that  the normal  type of player 1  goes down at his  information  set n, 
and  qn  for  the  probability  that  Player  2  goes  down  at  her  information  set  n. At  n = 1, 
player  2  goes  down  with  probability  1  (i.e.  q1  = 1),  and  at  n = 2,  the  normal  type  of 
player  1  goes  down  for  sure  (i.e.  p2  = 1),  and  hence  μ1  = 1. 
Note  that  n∗  > 3.  This is because  if  n∗  ≤  3,  then  Player  assigns  probability  0.001 
to  the  crazy  type  at  n  = 3  (by  Lemma  8),  in  which  case  she  must  go  down  at  n  = 
3,  contradicting  Lemma  4.  Hence,  by  Lemma  8  she  mixes  at  n  = 3. By  sequential 
rationality, she is indiﬀerent between going across, which yields μ3101 + (1 − μ3 ) 99, and 
going  down, which  yields  100.  Therefore, 

μ3  = 1/2. 

(10.1) 

Now  take  any  n in  between  3  and  n∗  at  which  Player  2 moves.  Let  x be  her  payoﬀ 
from  exiting  at  n. At  n − 2,  she  is  indiﬀerent  between  exiting,  which  yields  x + 2, and 
continuing.  Hence,  her  expected  payoﬀ  at  n − 2 is  x + 2. If Player  1  exits  at  n − 1, she 
gets  x − 1.  Since  she is indiﬀerent,  it must  be  that 
(x − 1) (1 − μ ) pn−1  + (x + 1) (1 − (1 − μ ) pn−1 ) = x,
n
n
and hence  the  total  probability  of  exit  at  n − 1 is 
(1 − μ ) pn−1  = 1/2.

CHAPTER 10.  REPUTATION FORMATION 

Thus,  by Bayes’  rule, 

μn  = μn−2/2. 
Together  with  (10.1),  (10.2)  and  (10.3)  yield  the  beliefs  and  the  mixing  probabilities 
throughout.  In  particular, 

(10.3) 

μ5  = 1/4 
μ7  = 1/8 
μ9  = 1/16 
μ11  = 1/32 
μ13  = 1/64 
μ15  = 1/128 
μ17  = 1/256 
μ19  = 1/512. 

The values of p4 , p6 , . . . , p18  are computed from these values using pn−1  = 1/ (2 (1 − μ )).n
Note that μ19/2 < 0.001, which is the prior belief for crazy type.  Since staying in the 
game  does  not  decrease  the  probability  of  the  crazy  type,  μ21  > μ19/2.  Hence,  Player  2 
does  not mix  at  n = 21.  Then,  by Lemma  8,  n∗  ≤ 21, and  μ21  = 0.001.  Therefore,

Note that since μ21  > μ19/2,  i.e.,the normal type of player 1 exits with a probability less 
than  that makes Player  2  indiﬀerent  at n = 19,  it  also  follows  that Player  2  goes  across 
with probability  1  at  n = 21, i.e.,  n∗  = 21. 
Note  that  at  information  sets  n = 198, . . . , 20,  both normal  type  and  the  crazy  type 
go  across  with  probability  1,  and  hence  the  probability  of  crazy  type  remains  constant 
at  0.001  as  seen  in  Figure  10.5.  Hence,  player  1  does  not  form  a  reputation  for  being 
crazy  by  staying  in  the  game  in  that  time  interval.  This  is  because  even  the  normal 
type  remains  in  the  game  given  the  long  future  in  the  relationship.  In  that  interval, 
both  players  remain  in  the  relationship  by  safely  assuming  that  the  other  will  do  so
