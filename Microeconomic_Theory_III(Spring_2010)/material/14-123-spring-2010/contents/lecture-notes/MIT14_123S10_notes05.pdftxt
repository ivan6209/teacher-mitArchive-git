Stochastic  Dominance 

In  this  lecture,  I  will  introduce  notions  of  stochastic  dominance  that  allow  one  to  de-
termine  the  preference  of  an  expected  utility  maximizer  between  some  lotteries  with 
minimal  knowledge  of  the  decision maker’s  utility  function. 
As  in  the  previous  lecture,  take  X  = R  as  the  set  of  wealth  level  and  let  u  be  the 
decision  maker’s  utility  function.  Assume  that  u  is  weakly  increasing.  The  lotteries 
are  distributed  by  their  cumulative  distribution  functions.  Designate  F  and  G  generic 
distribution  functions.  I will assume  throughout  that F  and G have a bounded  support 
[a, b] with F  (a) = G (a) = 0 and F  (b) = G (b) = 1. 
I will  deﬁne  two  notions  of  stochastic  dominance: 

1.	 First-order  stochastic  dominance:  when  a  lottery  F  dominates  G  in  the  sense  of 
ﬁrst-order  stochastic  dominance,  the  decision  maker  prefers  F  to  G  regardless  of 
what  u  is, as long as it is weakly increasing. 

2.	 Second-order  stochastic  dominance:  when a  lottery F  dominates G  in the sense of 
second-order  stochastic  dominance,  the  decision  maker  prefers  F  to  G  as  long  as 
he  is  risk  averse  and u  is weakly  increasing. 

5.1  First-order  Stochastic  Dominance 

Deﬁnition  12  For  any  lotteries  F  and  G,  F  ﬁrst-order  stochastically  dominates  G  if 
and  only  if 

F  (x) ≤ G (x)

(∀x) .

CHAPTER  5.  STOCHASTIC DOMINANCE 

Note  that  ﬁrst-order  stochastic  dominance  can  be  obtained  by  transferring  proba-
bility  weights  upwards.  For  an  illustration,  assume  that  F  and  G  are  continuous  and 
strictly  increasing  on  [a, b].  Suppose  that  lottery  x  is  distributed  with  G.  For  every 
realization  x,  let  us  give  the  decision maker  instead 

y (x) = F −1 (G (x)) . 

When  F  ﬁrst-order  stochastically  dominates G  (i.e.  F  (x) ≤ G (x)) we  would  be  giving 
him more  than  x  at  every  realization: 

y (x) = F −1 (G (x)) ≥ x. 
Hence,  under  the  new  scheme,  he would  be  getting  extra wealth F −1 (G (x)) − x ≥ 0  at 
every  realization.  But  the  new  lottery  y  is  distributed by F :  for  any  y¯, 
Pr (y (x) ≤ y¯) = Pr ¡x ≤ y−1 ( ¯y) ¢ 
=  G ¡y−1 ( ¯y) ¢ 
=  G ¡G−1F  ( ¯y) ¢ 
=  F  ( ¯y) , 
where  the  ﬁrst  equality  is  the  fact  that  y  is  increasing,  the  second  equality  is  by  the 
fact  that  x  is  distributed  by  G,  and  the  third  equality  is  by  deﬁnition  of  y  (y−1 ( ¯y) = 
G−1F  ( ¯y)). 
As long as the decision maker prefers having more wealth to less (i.e.  u is increasing), 
he  would  prefer  to  have  the  latter  scheme  y (x),  which  is  distributed by  F , rather  than 
x, which  is  distributed by G.  The  next  result  states  this  formally. 

Theorem  7  For  any  lotteries F  and G,  F  ﬁrst-order  stochastical ly  dominates G  if  and 
only  if  the  decision  maker  weakly  prefers  F  to  G  under  every  weakly  increasing  utility

Proof.  (

⇐
exists  x∗  such  that  F  (x∗ )  > G (x∗ ). Deﬁne  u  ≡  1{x>x∗ }  by  u (x) = 1  if  x > x∗  and  0 
otherwise.  Clearly,

(
)  I  will  prove  this  part  under  the  assumption  that  F  and  G  are  continuous  and 
⇒
strictly  increasing  on  [a, b].  In  that  case,  as we  have  seen  above,

u (y (x)) dG (x) ≥ 
where the equality by y (x) = F −1 (G (x)) and the inequality is by the fact that u (y (x)) ≥ 
u (x)  for  every  x, which  is  true  because  y (x) ≥ x  and  u  is weakly  increasing. 

u (y (x)) dF  (y (x)) = 

u (x) dG (x) , 

5.2  Second-order  Stochastic  Dominance 

Now  assume  that  F  and  G  have  the  same  mean,  so  that  one  does  not  dominate  the 
other in the sense of ﬁrst-order stochastic dominance.  Can we still say that a risk-averse 
decision  maker  prefers  F  to  G  without  knowing  his  utility  function  u?  Intuitively  this 
would be  the  case as  long as F  involves  less  risk  than G.  I will next  formalize  this  idea, 
and  this will  lead  to  the  notion  of  second-order  stochastic  dominance. 

Deﬁnition  13  For  any  lotteries  F  and  G,  F  second-order  stochastically  dominates  G 
if  and  only  if  the  decision  maker  weakly  prefers  F  to  G  under  every  weakly  increasing 
concave  utility  function  u. 

This  deﬁnition  is  directly  given  in  terms  of  the  ﬁnal  goal.  I  will  next  give  another 
equilvalent  deﬁnition, which  formalizes  the  idea  that G  is  riskier  than F . 

Deﬁnition  14  For  any  lotteries  F  and  G,  G  is  a  mean-preserving  spread  of  F  if  and 
only  if 

y = x + ε 

for  some  x ∼ F ,  y ∼ G  and  ε  such  that  E (ε|x) = 0  for  al l  x. 
Imagine  that  for  every  realization  x, we  add  a  noise  ε  and  give  decision  maker  y  = 
x + ε. Since E (ε|x) = 0,  this only makes  the consumption riskier without  improving  its 
expectation.  In  other  words,  we  are  spreading  the  probabilities  without  changing  the 
mean.  If  the  decision  maker  is  risk  averse,  he  would  not  like  to  have  this  scheme.  He 
would  rather  consume  x.  Indeed,  this  will  be  the  case.  Before  stating  this  formally,  it 
is  instructive to compare  this scheme to the one  in the ﬁrst-order stochastic dominance.

CHAPTER  5.  STOCHASTIC DOMINANCE 

In  that  case,  we  were  giving  him  an  extra  amount  consumption  at  every  realization  x. 
While  this  could  increase  the  variance  of  the  consumption,  the  decision  maker  knew 
that he was getting  if anything more.  He  liked that scheme.  Here, we are  increasing the 
variance  without  increasing  the  expectation.  He  can  gain  or  loss  by  the  change.  Being 
risk  averse,  he  does  not  like  the  change.

Clearly,  I (a) = 0. Since F  and G have the same mean,  it  is also true that I (b) = 0 (see
