1
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:10,669
OK.

2
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:13,379
Good morning everyone.

3
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:20,379
As I mentioned at the last lecture, we're
now moving into the nitty-gritty of the subsystems.

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,439
And we have quite an extraordinary list of
speakers who actually worked on the original

5
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,140
design of these systems.

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,430
And, as Professor Cohen mentioned, not only
did they design these systems for the shuttle

7
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:41,430
but, in most cases, they came from having
designed essentially the same systems on the

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,380
Apollo program.

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,460
So, in the question and answer period, if
there are some things that you'd like to know

10
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,570
about the comparison of Apollo and Shuttle,
and also any questions about the future since

11
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,910
some of you will be writing up possibilities
for future development of some of these systems,

12
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,079
please ask the questions.

13
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:06,079
And I spoke with Tom Moser, and he's fully
prepared to handle questions during the talk.

14
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,460
Because there will be a lot of fairly detailed
technical stuff, so if there's something that

15
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,560
you're not familiar with, you don't understand
or just have questions about, please ask while

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,700
the lecture is going on.

17
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:26,700
I want to remind you, we have fairly extensive
bios for all the speakers.

18
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,159
Rather than take the time in class to read
through this, I've posted them all on the

19
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,770
class website.

20
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:40,770
So my suggestion is go to the class website
before each class and just see the background

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,500
of the lecture.

22
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,189
Professor Cohen is going to make some personal
remarks about, well, whatever it is that you

23
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,210
want to say about our speaker.

24
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,799
Before we go into that, two things.

25
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:04,380
Tom Moser asked me if we had this book.

26
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,570
This actually is my personal copy.

27
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,399
I'm going to put it on reserve.

28
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,479
We may actually have it in the library as
well.

29
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,810
I'll check, and I'll make sure that this gets
on reserve.

30
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,099
This really is a rather complete book.

31
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:24,900
A lot the material that you've seen, the early
design of the shuttle is in here, discussions

32
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,900
of subsystems, and then detailed discussions
of the individual flights all the way up through

33
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,370
the first hundred shuttle flights.

34
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,739
It's a very nice resource, and we'll have
it on reserve in the library.

35
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:42,480
The next thing.

36
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,480
I believe I have now indications from everybody
about what you want to do your paper on.

37
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,830
We have two groups doing GN&C.

38
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,310
One group doing displays and controls.

39
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,519
We had two small groups interested in the
propulsion system.

40
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:12,129
And I've asked Brian and other people, you've
gotten together?

41
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:15,170
OK.

42
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,190
Only one person, Dan, I think, indicated an
interest in the thermal protection system.

43
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,580
I know we've got a lot people on GN&C.

44
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,030
One of you, I think, had actually indicated
an interest in thermal protection.

45
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,959
I will leave that up to you.

46
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:38,959
If somebody would like to work on thermal
protection with Dan, he's back there and is

47
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,500
available, I guess.

48
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:48,500
We have one group which is going to do a little
bit of a different sort of project on modularity

49
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,519
and some of the design methods that went into
the shuttle compared to modern techniques

50
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,090
that are available now, so we'll be interested
in seeing what you'll come up with.

51
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:04,510
And then we had a group that wants to look
at the propulsion system, but from the point

52
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,489
of view of fuel storage and what the system
would have looked like if we had possibly

53
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:11,750
used alternate fuels.

54
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,079
We've got a nice spectrum of things that people
will look at.

55
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,599
Any time you'd like to come and talk with
me, with Professor Cohen or take advantage

56
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:28,240
of one of the speakers who happens to be talking
about the area that you're interested in,

57
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,780
please do that.

58
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,910
We do have time usually after class, if you're
free.

59
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,490
The speakers will generally be available so
take advantage of it.

60
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:40,740
OK.

61
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,790
That's enough talking from me.

62
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:50,790
Aaron, I'll give this to you..

63
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,040
I just have a few personal comments about
Mr. Moser.

64
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,440
He is going to talk to you today, lecture
you today about the structures on the space

65
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,500
shuttle.

66
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,190
But Tom, as Jeff mentioned, did the same work
on the Apollo program.

67
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,419
I was the manager of the Command and Service
Module on Apollo and on the Space Shuttle

68
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:23,430
Orbiter, so Tom and I have been working tighter
for many years.

69
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,560
And I relied very, very heavily on Tom throughout
the years.

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,180
I told a little anecdote the other day, and
just let me say it again because the person

71
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,860
that helped me with it is Tom Moser.

72
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,229
During one of the shuttle missions, we were
getting ready to come back, about 11:00 at

73
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:43,650
night, I was getting ready to leave my house
to go to the Control Center, which I live

74
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:49,289
about ten minutes away, and we were getting
ready to make the de-orbit burn, I got a call

75
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:55,800
from Rockwell International, their head of
the program there.

76
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,410
And he said, Aaron, we just did this test.

77
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:05,210
We took the panel of tiles and dumped it into
a bucket of waterproofing agent and all the

78
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:05,960
tiles came off.

79
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,350
I said what do you want me to do with that
information?

80
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,639
I said they're getting ready to come back
and there's not much I can do about that.

81
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,850
You're telling me all the tiles are going
to come off?

82
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,669
He said no, they're not because that's not
really what we did on the shuttle.

83
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:20,819
I said well, why did you do that test?

84
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:21,830
That's sort of a dumb test.

85
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,759
I had a decision to make, whether I'd call
the people in the Control Center like Chris

86
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,560
Kraft and tell him we did this test and all
the tiles are going to come off.

87
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:33,819
But we've got to come back.

88
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:38,360
I decided what I would do is call my good
colleague Tom Moser.

89
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,940
I said Tom, what should we do?

90
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,810
We talked for a while and talked for a while,
and we decided to keep this information to

91
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,130
ourselves until after the landing.

92
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,120
It turns out it all worked out fine.

93
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,660
There were no problems.

94
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,610
But my point to you is that how much I relied
on Tom.

95
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,319
The other point is you may find yourself in
that type of situation some day on a project

96
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,020
maybe not associated with that.

97
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:07,020
Tom turned out to be afterward my Deputy Manager
in the Orbiter Project Office.

98
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,539
Then he went on to become Head of Engineering
at the Johnson Space Center and then went

99
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:20,380
on to be Director of the Space Station in
Washington, DC and now is a consultant.

100
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:26,660
So, with no further ado, let me turn it over
to Tom.

101
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,840
One thing I learned to do is have my own mic
because Aaron will keep it.

102
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,770
One of the advantages to having a gray beard,
besides some of the folks in the back, is

103
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,910
I'm not going to refer to him as Professor
Cohen or as Professor Hoffman.

104
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,160
It's Jeff and Aaron.

105
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,699
It's not out of disrespect.

106
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:52,699
It's just the way I grew up so that's OK to
do.

107
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:58,860
When Aaron asked me to do this, and Jeff,
I thought that's easy, I'll just pull out

108
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,270
some of my old notes and stuff like that and
I will be up the next day.

109
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:09,270
Until Jeff sent me the syllabus and what it
was to do, it made me start thinking about

110
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,919
what I'd spent a good part of my life doing.

111
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,690
And that was designing and development of
the shuttle with Aaron and some of the others,

112
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:20,080
but from a systems engineering perspective
which you guys are doing.

113
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,220
So, what I did is I went back and looked at
everything from a systems engineering point

114
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,879
of view from 1968 all the way until '81 when
the shuttle flew.

115
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,069
But I looked at it through the knothole of
a structure and thermal person.

116
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:34,569
So, that's what I'm going to present to you
today.

117
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:38,690
And, as you go through each phase of the program
it changes.

118
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:44,800
And sometimes it's down to the minute detail
and other times it is the macro.

119
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,740
That's my objective, and I hope we accomplish
that.

120
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,600
Ask me any questions any time that you want
to.

121
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,760
Just a little bit of credit and recognition
of some of the people that made this thing

122
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,040
happen.

123
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,760
You're going to hear from a lot of these people.

124
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,760
You won't hear from John Yardley or Max Faget
because they are deceased now, but these people

125
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:11,360
up here made this program go.

126
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,740
And then you will have also some references
that give you a lot more detail than I'm going

127
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,170
to give you today, even though I'm going to
cover a lot of it.

128
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:26,450
There is one unique thing about a program
like this that is complex.

129
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:31,760
And that is the technical team and the management
team have to work together and get together.

130
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,760
Everybody that is listed up there stayed on
this program from day one, and that is key.

131
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,760
I don't think there has been a program since
then that that has happened.

132
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,060
And I think that if people judge the Shuttle
Program as being successful, I think that

133
00:09:53,060 --> 00:10:00,060
that's a major contribution to that success.

134
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:08,820
Beginning in '68 when the concept studies
began, all the way down to operations from

135
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,200
a structural perspective, what is important
at each one of those phases in its weight

136
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,769
and cost and produceability from day one.

137
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:22,399
But then it gets into the certification phase,
the last part of the program, how are you

138
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,519
going to certify this thing?

139
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,860
How are you going to prove that it's good
for flight?

140
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,860
How are you going to prove that the crew is
safe?

141
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,839
And you have to do it on the ground.

142
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,040
So, it's a completely different knothole you're
looking through and a completely different

143
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,339
set of parameters.

144
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:41,010
I didn't start on Apollo at the beginning
like Aaron did.

145
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,850
I came out a little bit later.

146
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:50,850
But, in this program, I had the good fortune
of working on it from sketchpad to launch

147
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,240
pad.

148
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,910
And that's the way I characterized it.

149
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,839
And Aaron didn't know this, but at the end
I would have worked for free to complete the

150
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,180
program because I was going to see something
from beginning to end.

151
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:06,620
And so if you ever had that opportunity to
get on the program at the very beginning,

152
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:12,140
I don't care what knothole you're looking
at it through, stay on that program if you

153
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:18,700
can because it's a completely different life
at every step along the way.

154
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,940
So, from the knothole of Orbiter structure,
I'm going to break this thing into two pieces,

155
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:28,940
Orbiter structure and the thermal protection
system..

156
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:41,600
On the concept studies that began in '68,
what was the objective of those concept studies?

157
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,560
Conceiving, characterizing and characterizing
by qualitative and quantitative concepts that

158
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,779
would appear to work.

159
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:55,779
So, it was determining really the feasibility
of the concepts.

160
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:03,950
When that began, the only requirement in the
Shuttle Program was to have a reusable space

161
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,910
transportation system.

162
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:12,370
Get something that goes from earth to low
earth orbit and back reliably and reusable.

163
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,079
There wasn't a requirement on payload size,
there wasn't a requirement on number of missions,

164
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,209
there wasn't a requirement on any of those
things.

165
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:21,510
That's what it was.

166
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:27,990
The variables that we all looked at, though,
were budgets, yearly budgets, developments

167
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,990
costs, operations cost.

168
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:34,170
And you'll see, as you go through some of
this stuff, and probably some of the stuff

169
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:39,350
that Dale Myers showed you, is development
cost, you can spend a lot of money on development

170
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,910
and reduce the operations cost or you can
spend a little bit of money on development

171
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,089
and have very high operational cost.

172
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:45,970
So, there's a trade there.

173
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,480
And when you're dealing with budgets that
you really don't understand exactly what they

174
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,700
are, that's a very important variable.

175
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,470
Payload mass and size is important from a
structural and thermal standpoint because

176
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:04,459
it has to do with mass and it has to do with
energy that has to be dissipated during reentry.

177
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,519
The operational orbit is important.

178
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:12,300
Fully reusable flight systems or partially
reusable, and that's a trade on cost and weight.

179
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,660
Turnaround time and cross-range.

180
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:20,800
Cross-range was critical to us at this point
because NASA didn't have a requirement for

181
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,529
cross-range.

182
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:25,519
And that's cross-range after you come back
into the atmosphere to be able to deviate

183
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,540
your normal ballistic trajectory coming back
in.

184
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,920
But the Air Force thought that they had a
requirement so we had to include that.

185
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,920
And then, as we got into the next phase of
it, looking at what was important from a structural

186
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:53,510
standpoint is the efficiency of the load path,
the weight, the payload size, the aerodynamic

187
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,370
surface loading, now we're beginning to get
in and look at what are the wing loads, et

188
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:04,370
cetera, and how does that manifest itself
in weight and produceability?

189
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:17,040
We did that under two years of contracted
effort.

190
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:24,339
Then within JSC, the Johnson Space Center,
which was formally the Manned Space Craft

191
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:29,300
Center, we conceptionally looked at designs
in-house.

192
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,459
And we looked at 53 different designs.

193
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:36,959
You talk about a systems engineering thing,
what we did was got a group of people about

194
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,040
the size of this room and went away and locked
ourselves up.

195
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,660
But we had expertise in every area, propulsion,
guidance and control, aerodynamics, aero heating,

196
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,209
that kind of stuff.

197
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:51,660
And we were almost doing a configuration a
week when we did that.

198
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:58,660
So, when you look at 53 different configurations
over basically a two-year period, we were

199
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:06,910
not only just looking at it but we were quantifying
then, what it meant in terms of all the parameters

200
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:09,959
that I showed you a while ago.

201
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:10,970
How much did it cost?

202
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,269
What was the development cost?

203
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:13,699
What was the operations cost?

204
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:14,740
What was the weight?

205
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,649
What was the maximum temperature as we saw
on the vehicle?

206
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:23,959
Was there a thermal protection system that
could accommodate those types of temperatures?

207
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:29,709
That was the characterization in the systems
engineering parameters that we used.

208
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:32,120
Tom, where these designs kind of refined?

209
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,730
Were you refining with each iteration or was
it like we'll try this for a couple iterations

210
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,910
and then maybe try something completely different?

211
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,009
Were you working towards a final [OVERLAPPING
VOICES]?

212
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,889
Well, what we were doing was looking at the
variables.

213
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:50,990
In other words, like here, when we looked
at 53 different things, we looked at payloads

214
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,420
ranging anywhere from 15,000 to 40,000 pounds.

215
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,149
We didn't know what the answer was going to
be.

216
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:01,779
The driving thing there was reusability and
cost profile.

217
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:04,759
We thought we knew what we could afford to
do.

218
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:09,720
We looked at payloads from 8 feet in diameter
to 15 feet in diameter, 30 feet long to 75

219
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,350
feet long.

220
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,570
We were looking at all of those things.

221
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,690
And, as we did that, we changed configuration
from a straight wing, which is not good for

222
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:23,730
cross-range, to a delta wing which is better
for a cross-range, to a double delta wing

223
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,540
which is even more structurally efficient.

224
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,579
Landing weights then was important.

225
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,990
Just like everybody saw the plane landing
last night, it had to get that landing weight

226
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,230
down to where it could control it.

227
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,949
Well, that was the same thing we were doing.

228
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:43,050
We were looking at landing weights, not only
from a controllability but also from a produceability.

229
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:49,910
We looked at weights from 70,000 to 215,000
pounds, boosters from fully reusable to partially

230
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,540
reusable, propulsion systems and various types
of things.

231
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,839
We even looked at air breathers so that they
didn't have to come back a dead stick like

232
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
they do now when Jeff was in the vehicle.

233
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,539
And pressure fed and pump fed systems.

234
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:07,819
There was simplicity and complications in
all of them.

235
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,049
Tankage, internal or external to the Orbiter.

236
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:17,049
Could you maybe say, for people's benefit
here who have grown up in the computer age,

237
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,510
something about the tools that you had?

238
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,299
I am going to do that in a minute.

239
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:23,350
You are, OK.

240
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,939
I'm going to give you a challenge, too.

241
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,039
So, we looked at all of those.

242
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:32,450
And, we not only looked at it, we quantified
it to the extent that we could get the first

243
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,510
order estimates on what the cost in all those
things where.

244
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,960
Now then, I chose a couple of them here.

245
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,809
This was one of the early designs of the Orbiter.

246
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:47,169
Look where the locks and hydrogen are.

247
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:48,160
It's inside the Orbiter.

248
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:55,160
It has a straight wing so it was fairly lightweight,
except for having to carry all that tankage.

249
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,270
The engines were on the Orbiter itself, but
the payload was really small.

250
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,020
Very low cross-range, very low payload.

251
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,730
So that was probably the 8 foot diameter 40,000
pound payload.

252
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:14,730
We evolved that over a series of studies until
we finally got down to about February of '72

253
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,360
where we said we're going to have to have
a larger payload than this.

254
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,710
And the cost profile didn't fit.

255
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,880
What we did is we came up with a configuration
that's almost like the shuttle that you see

256
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,660
today.

257
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,919
Large payload, all the propulsion systems,
the main propulsion systems are outside the

258
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:32,169
Orbiter.

259
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,690
And it's a fly back, and part of it was throwaway.

260
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:40,179
In this case, we had a booster in line with
the external tank rather than in parallel

261
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:42,929
with it like the SRBs are today.

262
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:47,830
Basically that's what we started the detailed
design and development with, but not exactly.

263
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,380
And I'll show you that.

264
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:55,380
Now then, some of us who like to worry about
load pass and simplicity and low weight of

265
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,610
the structure, we said ah-ha.

266
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:07,610
What we will do is put the engines on the
external tank.

267
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,070
All the mass is down here.

268
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,970
Very little mass up here.

269
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:20,990
And for boost reduce the weight of the Orbiter,
which is going to reduce development and operations

270
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,950
costs a whole bunch and thermal protection
system, but we have to swing these engines

271
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,780
for reusability from the external tank back
up the Orbiter and stow them for entry.

272
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,740
Well, our brother in mechanical engineers,
they beat us pretty hard.

273
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,760
They beat us black and blue.

274
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,140
Anyway, that was a concept that we looked
at very late in the program.

275
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,559
And that didn't go anywhere, even though Max
Faget and I wanted to do it pretty badly.

276
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:51,559
As we continue now.

277
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:56,120
Now we're four years into the thing, we've
done all these systems engineering analysis,

278
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,100
so we end up with a final concept.

279
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,250
Here's what we want.

280
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:06,250
We want a 2.5 stage launch vehicle because
it costs too much basically to fly back the

281
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,900
booster.

282
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,130
We just didn't have the money so we said we
want to have the most important part be fully

283
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,409
reusable, so that was the Orbiter.

284
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:15,780
It was going to be a delta wing.

285
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:22,780
We figured that the mission life, we had a
mission model of 500 total missions, 100 missions

286
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,460
per vehicle, and there were five vehicles.

287
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,960
We had an ascent acceleration of 3 g's.

288
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,419
Why was that?

289
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,940
Really, the requirement was to keep down the
inertia loads, but it was also to let people

290
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,390
off the street flying the thing.

291
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:39,659
Go ahead.

292
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:42,169
What constitutes half a stage?

293
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:49,169
Half a stage means that the external tank
is like a half a stage.

294
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:54,770
The SRB is a stage, the engine, the Orbiter
is a stage, but the tank is a half a stage.

295
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:01,770
We kept the max dynamic pressure down because
that was a major driver for control systems

296
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,250
and for aerodynamic services.

297
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,980
You would love not to have the wings on the
Orbiter going uphill.

298
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,070
That's a penalty that you pay.

299
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,919
So, one of the things to help reduce that
is to keep that aerodynamic load down on the

300
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,309
wings.

301
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:24,370
Then for atmospheric flights, and I'm going
to talk a little bit more about that, we said

302
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,260
this thing is going to come back like an airplane.

303
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,059
Let's fly it.

304
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:32,200
Let's design it like an airplane 2.5 g normal
maneuver load factor and a negative 1 g.

305
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,059
A crew of four for one week.

306
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:39,830
That becomes kind of important because that
sized the crew module, that sized a lot of

307
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:45,159
the environmental control systems you'll hear
about later and other things in the life support

308
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:46,870
systems.

309
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:52,669
So, without a lot of changes, to show you
what the flexibility and capability of this

310
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:58,840
vehicle is, the Orbiter is now flying seven
people for two weeks.

311
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:05,840
So, it went from 28 man days to 63 man days
basically.

312
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:10,539
And I don't think a lot of people understand
what that has done.

313
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:16,370
And there is a lot more robustness in the
Orbiter, in the shuttle system that was not

314
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,110
designed into it but had some inherent capability.

315
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,870
And also some of it was a little bit of forethought
in the thing.

316
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,270
Here comes the Air Force stuff.

317
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,020
65,000 pounds up.

318
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,659
40,000 pounds return.

319
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,120
That was the requirements.

320
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,789
15 x 60.

321
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:38,370
Another important thing is we didn't know
what they'd be but maybe up to five payloads

322
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,030
at a time.

323
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:43,110
And that's going to become a problem, I'll
show you about in a minute, as we start peeling

324
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:49,830
this systems engineering onion of getting
down into the details.

325
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,020
And deployable payloads.

326
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,270
Cross-range.

327
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,549
A little less than 1300 nautical miles cross-range.

328
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:56,960
TPS material.

329
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,100
We didn't know what the hell it was going
to be, but that's what we started with.

330
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:09,100
So, we began the contract for design, development,
test and evaluation.

331
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:12,929
NASA does pretty good stuff in-house.

332
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:14,970
And I think with Dr.

333
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,820
Mike Griffin at the helm now you're going
to see a lot more of that coming into NASA

334
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,190
where they're doing a lot of stuff in-house.

335
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:28,049
But when it gets down to doing the detail,
design and manufacturing and cost-control,

336
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:32,850
down to the detailed parts and manifesting
everything around, that's where the contract

337
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,100
is.

338
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,460
NASA doesn't have that capability in a large
program.

339
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,000
So, this is where we gave a contract to Rockwell
International.

340
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,220
They had the integration contract.

341
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,090
And another company, Martin, had the external
tank.

342
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,610
[Backhaul?] had the SRBs.

343
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,980
And who else am I missing?

344
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,860
And Rockwell had the integration and Orbiter
contract, both.

345
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,570
This is what they started with.

346
00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:02,570
That was their authority to proceed configuration,
even though this is shown as in 1972.

347
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:08,850
But you see there is very little difference
in the configuration then and what the configuration

348
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,740
is today.

349
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,390
There was some minor mods which are not worthy
of even talking about right now.

350
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:23,390
But let me give Aaron a lot of credit.

351
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,419
His favorite word, the whole time he was the
project manager, was no.

352
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:36,419
And he had above his blackboard better is
the enemy of good.

353
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,409
We've got something.

354
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:39,460
We know it will work.

355
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,570
We knew that damn configuration would work.

356
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,250
And Aaron got inundated with people coming
back after we started the program.

357
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:54,250
Aaron, if you put reaction control jets out
on the wing tips and here and up on the vertical

358
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,720
stabilizer you get a lot more control authority.

359
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,279
And when you guys start looking at this guidance
and control stuff in propulsion you're going

360
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,549
to come up with that.

361
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:07,900
But it complicated the entry in the thermal
protection system.

362
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,900
It complicated getting the fuel to those things,
so Aaron said no, no, no.

363
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,870
And the astronauts would come in.

364
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:19,029
They'll always meet with Aaron at 7:00 in
the morning because that's when they would

365
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:20,350
get their word in.

366
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,159
And so they would have to go do flight training
or something like that.

367
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,110
And, as they walked out the door, Aaron would
say no.

368
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,220
They didn't hear him, but it was always no.

369
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,000
And that was critical in this thing.

370
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,760
And so the program came in at $5.1 billion.

371
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,510
It started $5.1 billion.

372
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,210
It came in at $5.1 billion.

373
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,039
It was only because of being able to say no.

374
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:48,020
But to say no you better do a good systems
engineering job at the beginning.

375
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,799
And were there some faults and errors?

376
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,049
Yeah.

377
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:57,010
I'll confess and open my kimono here on the
few of the things, but all in all it wasn't

378
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,730
too bad.

379
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:05,549
And I will say one other thing about systems
engineering.

380
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:12,460
It was interesting to watch four or five different
large companies look at the various concepts.

381
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:18,600
I can say this now because none of these companies
even exist in the form that they were then.

382
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,020
Grumman had a very large systems engineering
organization.

383
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:29,929
Rockwell had a very small systems engineering
organization, almost down to one or two people,

384
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:32,330
but they were extremely good.

385
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,870
They were extremely good systems engineers.

386
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:41,870
NASA went with Rockwell for a number of reasons,
but one of the things that probably benefited

387
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:52,350
the program was having a very concentrated
set of engineering requirements coming out

388
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,130
of a systems engineer which almost turned
out to be one guy, Ed Smith.

389
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:00,039
And he was very, very good at that.

390
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:05,539
The reason I bring that up to you, the thing
that's most defficient, from my perspective

391
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:11,120
now in the United States today, are good systems
engineers.

392
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,640
Very good thermal engineers, good structural
engineers, good propulsion engineers.

393
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,240
There are very few systems engineers that
are good.

394
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:26,240
If you make a note of that and become one
of those, you'd be highly sought after.

395
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:29,690
So, a little bit of this is a repeat.

396
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:36,690
As we went into these requirements, and from
a government system's perspective, now the

397
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:44,169
challenge was to give the contractor the requirements
that they need but don't over-specify the

398
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:45,470
requirements.

399
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:51,500
We were very careful to say here are the top
level requirements, don't ask us what the

400
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,270
internal loads on the wing are because we're
not going to tell you what that is.

401
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,510
That is for you to decide.

402
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,750
And, if you want to change something within
these constraints, you can change it.

403
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:05,809
But the burden is on you to make everything
else right.

404
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:11,840
That is something that I think the Orbiter
did probably better than the external tank.

405
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,779
I'll just say it like it is.

406
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:15,360
Go ahead.

407
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,059
I'm just wondering, sir, what happened to
the canard configuration with the delta wing?

408
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,809
What happened to it?

409
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:23,059
Yeah.

410
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,059
It was not selected.

411
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:28,720
And I don't remember why it was not selected.

412
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,880
What was driving it, I don't know.

413
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,990
I don't have those notes anymore.

414
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,419
It could have been cross-range.

415
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:44,840
I don't remember that particular configuration,
if it had the required cross-range for the

416
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,580
payload mass.

417
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,100
I just don't remember.

418
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,590
I don't think it would have been cost.

419
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,710
I think it was a lot of complexity.

420
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,990
Well, it did have complexity so it had to
add some cost.

421
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:01,990
Weight-wise, it probably was not too different
just because of the control authority of having

422
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,559
the canards there.

423
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:04,399
But that's a good question.

424
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:11,330
Tom, you might mention [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

425
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,159
I'm going to touch on that, again, a little
bit in a minute about what we did in surveying

426
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:16,610
and determining the loads.

427
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:23,610
And let me hold that if I can.

428
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:28,210
Now we have begun with the design..

429
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:35,210
When you use the term top level requirements,
what does the top level refer to as opposed

430
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:52,909
to just requirements or performance requirements?

431
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,080
Well, the top level requirement changes as
the phase changes.

432
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,039
The very beginning, in '68, the top level
requirement was a transportation system.

433
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,970
We don't know what it's going to be, reusable,
and we don't know how much payload it is going

434
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,970
to have to carry.

435
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,820
So, that was the top level requirement.

436
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:17,820
Then it was to look at all of the combinations
of things that you could create.

437
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:23,760
The solution was it is feasible and we think
that this is about what it's going to cost.

438
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,130
Now, as we get into this point, these are
the top level requirements.

439
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:35,130
So, the granularity of the requirements increases
as the program advances.

440
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:42,690
Good question..

441
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:49,279
For the challenges, now I'm going to call
it the challenges of beginning this thing,

442
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,539
we know what the configuration is, you know
what the design life is, et cetera, all that

443
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:59,570
kind of stuff, but we still haven't decided
on what the material of the airframe is going

444
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,169
to be.

445
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:04,330
We estimated some stuff because it could be
aluminum or it could be titanium and this

446
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,120
is what it would be.

447
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,460
And it all fits within the right cost and
performance envelopes, but let's optimize

448
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,950
that from a systems standpoint a little bit
and see what that is.

449
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,980
Some of the challenges in structural design,
and I'm going to talk about each one of these

450
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:24,269
things that's listed on here separately, should
the cabin be an integral part of the fuselage

451
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:27,659
or should it be a pressure vessel floating
within the fuselage?

452
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:28,779
Trade to be made.

453
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:31,070
How are we going to account for thermal stress
in this?

454
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,840
Well, what the hell is thermal stress?

455
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,620
Apollo, we didn't care a whole lot about thermal
stress.

456
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,899
It really wasn't an issue, not to the extent
that a vehicle like this is.

457
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,399
It was very sensitive for thermal stress.

458
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:44,279
Compartment venting.

459
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,080
We'll talk more about that.

460
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,929
Major structure concept trades to reduce weight
basically.

461
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:56,919
And then how in the hell do we get the design
loads on this thing?

462
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:03,210
From a structural design criteria we said,
well, let's start with 1.5.

463
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,970
That's what all airplanes are designed for
so we'll do that.

464
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,000
Even though some of the boosters were designed
for 1.25.

465
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,580
Does everybody know what an ultimate factor
safety is?

466
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:19,580
That's the allowable of the material that
you've decided to use compared to the maximum

467
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:24,019
expected load that you will ever want to see,
three sigma kind of loads.

468
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:28,970
And then whatever the factor is about that,
that's the factor of safety.

469
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:34,899
So, you simply take the maximum loads you
can expect to find, multiply it by 1.4 and

470
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:36,659
it better meet what the allowable is.

471
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:40,950
If there's margin in that allowable then that's
called a design margin.

472
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,320
Ideally, you would like to have zero margin.

473
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,269
That still gives you a 40% factor of safety.

474
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:50,600
Everybody with me?

475
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,370
Yield is classically something that you decided
on material.

476
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,700
Well, I want to also have a factor safety
on yield.

477
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,250
And we sat around and asked ourselves why
the hell do we care about that?

478
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:06,510
The only thing you don't want it to do is
you don't want it to deform such that it won't

479
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:12,010
operate so doors won't open, hinges won't
work, et cetera.

480
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:17,669
We did not impose that on the program of the
yield factor safety.

481
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:19,480
We didn't on the Orbiter.

482
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,880
The external tank did.

483
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,390
And they paid a weight for that because if
you put a 1.2 factor safety on yield for some

484
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,590
materials, that gives you a lower allowable
than an ultimate factor safety when you're

485
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:36,710
really only interested in ultimate strength.

486
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:41,990
And then we had said thermal stress is going
to be important, but we don't want to be so

487
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:48,289
conservative that we let the thermal stress
add in such a way that it adds conservatism.

488
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:53,980
But, at the same time, we don't want it to
count on it if it's relieving when we cannot

489
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,090
really rely on it to be there.

490
00:33:55,090 --> 00:34:00,779
So, it is decreasing from the stress point
of view.

491
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:04,909
A scatter factor of four on life for a hundred
missions.

492
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,309
What is scatter factor?

493
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:09,629
Scatter factor just means a factor of four.

494
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:16,629
If you have 10,000 cycles at 20,000 psi stress
then you have to certify it for 40,000 cycles.

495
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:25,260
Typically, most airplanes you fly around on,
they have a design life of about 20,000 flight

496
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:28,450
hours.

497
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,750
I think that's about right.

498
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:36,750
They are fatigue tested to 80,000 flight hours
to make sure that they have that kind of factor

499
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:39,300
on life.

500
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,310
And then we said well, this thing is going
to be used a lot, we've never looked at that

501
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:47,859
before so we will arbitrarily say we'll use
a 1.2 factor at the end of life or ultimate.

502
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:54,169
And then these are just classical engineering
material allowables that everybody uses today.

503
00:34:54,169 --> 00:35:01,169
A lot of people have mentioned lately, as
we were thinking of the end of the life of

504
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:11,780
the shuttle, that although it was designed
for a hundred missions, I guess it was always

505
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,839
assumed that those hundred missions would
be flown over the course of just a few years.

506
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,859
And so, I think it's true, you more concerned
with the long-term effects of stress than

507
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:27,089
things like weathering or being exposed to
salt, air over 20 years.

508
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:30,210
Is that correct?

509
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,280
Well, you hit a very key point.

510
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,550
And you're exactly right.

511
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:38,140
It turns out a hundred missions wasn't really
designing anything.

512
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,960
I mean it could have.

513
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,260
Well, as a matter of fact, it didn't.

514
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,490
I don't know of anything.

515
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:48,710
A hundred missions design is for a cyclic
stress, high cycle, low stress fatigue or

516
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,310
low cycle high stress.

517
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,430
It didn't.

518
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:58,300
But the environment sitting around or the
life of the material exposed has.

519
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:03,650
The leading edge turned out to be there is
a degradation in the strength of the leading

520
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:09,570
edge material, the carbon-carbon material
because of being exposed to the conditions.

521
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,420
There was some corrosion found in the wings
during an inspection.

522
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,970
Nothing was wrong with the low carrying capability,
except it was beginning to corrode.

523
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:24,970
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] You've got me mixed
up with somebody else.

524
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,560
I'm not talking about avionics.

525
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,339
[LAUGHTER] No, but it's true.

526
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:39,270
There, I think, just to bring that up, the
idea was they would not be good for that length

527
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:43,250
of time so change them out, we're going to
have to upgrade them anyway.

528
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:50,250
Aaron, I think, just left being program manager
when they decided to change,no you still were

529
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,170
there, they decided to change the general-purpose
computers.

530
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,940
It took ten years to change the general-purpose
computers because of all the certification.

531
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,920
Did the use and safety factors, like what
numbers you were using, how much did the Apollo

532
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,010
program [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] aircraft safety
factors?

533
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:18,010
The Apollo program was like 1.2 factor of
safety, as I recall, because it was a single

534
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,490
use item.

535
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:30,490
And I'm going to take the opportunity to go
back and verify that, but I think that's was

536
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,089
right for some conditions.

537
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:35,070
And it could have been 1.5 on others.

538
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:41,680
I know on pressure alone it was 1.5 psi.

539
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,170
You say, well, why was it different for pressure
than it was for others?

540
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:49,839
Because there was some historical data there
that NASA had that said that was the right

541
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:50,920
thing to use.

542
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,790
But that's a good question.

543
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,460
Now you've caught me.

544
00:37:53,460 --> 00:38:00,460
I can remember on the boosters it was 1.25,
but on the command module itself, let me retract

545
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,980
that, it was probably 1.5.

546
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:10,980
It was 1.25 on the boosters and 1.5 on the
crude part of the vehicle.

547
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:23,740
One of the challenges that we had here was
to establish a criteria.

548
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,579
These were our objectives.

549
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:30,770
To assure that there was a realistic stress
that we're putting in the vehicle and we weren't

550
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,770
being overly conservative with it.

551
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,630
We were not reducing the stress because of
thermal gradients.

552
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,960
And then we were incorporating the classical
pressure induced stress.

553
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,060
And now what were the details of that?

554
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,430
Here were the details.

555
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:52,430
We came up with this algorithm that says we
will use a factor of 1.4 on all external loads

556
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,270
because that's aerodynamic loads, inertia
loads and so forth.

557
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:04,119
We will use a factor of 1.4 on the thermally
induced loads, if you will.

558
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:06,010
They are really thermally induced strains
and stress.

559
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:12,329
We'll use a 1.4 factor on that if it's additive
to the mechanical, but if it's subtractive

560
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:16,990
we'll only use one because we probably won't
reach the maximum thermal conditions so you

561
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,720
cannot rely on that.

562
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,430
On pressure, we used 1.4.

563
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,270
Unless it was pressure alone, we used 1.5.

564
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:31,599
But the whole thing is we would never have
less than 1.4 of the total combined load.

565
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,450
So, that's what we did.

566
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,520
And so you say why in the hell did you do
that?

567
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,500
Why did you have to go to that kind of detail?

568
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,970
The reason being is because you probably had
about 30,000 stress engineers working on the

569
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,500
program, and they needed to know how to combine
this stuff.

570
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,040
If you didn't, this guy is going to do one
thing and this guy is going to do something

571
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,200
different.

572
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,380
We got it down to that level to save weight
in the vehicle and save complexity in the

573
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,450
vehicle.

574
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:03,000
Well, we have our criteria set now.

575
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,940
Let me give one more story on marginal safety.

576
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:12,050
One of the people that I showed you at the
top of the credits list was John Yardley.

577
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:19,050
And probably Aaron and Larry Young and other
people would probably agree with this, John

578
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:23,349
Yardley is probably the best engineer that
I ever knew in my entire life.

579
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:28,329
He's probably one of the best managers I ever
knew.

580
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:35,210
John Yardley had the job of being the Program
Manager on McDonnell Douglas F4 aircraft.

581
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,130
And he was an old stress guy.

582
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:43,089
He knew that weight was going to be a critical
parameter in the success of that program and

583
00:40:43,089 --> 00:40:46,420
he had to keep the weight out.

584
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,670
What he did, on that previous slide where
I showed you the stress criteria and make

585
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:55,150
sure that you have a zero margin of safety
with a factor of 1.4, is he told all the stress

586
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:59,060
engineers, because they all worked for him,
design to a negative 10%.

587
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,410
Which means if you really do your job right
this thing is not going to be able to reach

588
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:03,930
ultimate load.

589
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,760
It's going to break.

590
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,140
But he also knew that they were probably conservative
because he was one of those guys.

591
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:16,160
And he also had in his hip pocket, if he's
wrong he would find out because he had the

592
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,410
opportunity to do an ultimate load test on
the airframe.

593
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:25,810
It turns out he did the ultimate load test,
it passed the ultimate load capability and

594
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:30,859
he saved a bunch of weight in airplane which
made it a very successful airplane.

595
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:37,859
Sometimes from a systems perspective, it's
what you learn in the details or in the trenches

596
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:43,079
as you're coming up and being able to apply
it the same way that Aaron did a lot of stuff

597
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:46,280
as he was managing the program.

598
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:53,160
On the airframe we looked at a lot of different
structural materials, we looked at a lot of

599
00:41:53,160 --> 00:42:00,160
different TPS materials, and some of the parameters
that were coming out in there was not only

600
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,390
strength of the material but how much heat
sink there was because you were having to

601
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,460
rely on that to keep the weights down.

602
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,579
And let me go up one slide and show you something
here.

603
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:17,579
I don't know if you can read that, but on
the left side what it was is it was all aluminum

604
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:20,599
airframe.

605
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:23,700
It had an ablator thermal protection system
on it.

606
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,650
And you said, well, I thought you said it
was going to be fully reusable.

607
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,160
Well, we also had a cost constraint.

608
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,430
So we put that in there as a reference point.

609
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,800
And that was the lowest cost.

610
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,099
And here's weight up here.

611
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:43,099
It wasn't quite the lowest weight, it was
pretty low, but it still was violating the

612
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,310
objectives and requirements that we had.

613
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,369
And we said that will be our reference point.

614
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:48,589
Then we looked at different types of aluminum.

615
00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:49,790
We looked a beryllium.

616
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,960
We looked at titanium.

617
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,410
We looked at the thermal protection system
on a beryllium substrate.

618
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,480
Every kind of combination you could think
of.

619
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,640
The interesting thing was, look where the
whites were staying.

620
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,640
They were all staying within the 60,000 to
80,000 pound total weight envelope.

621
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:15,420
What was happening is we were decreasing the
thermal protection system thickness.

622
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,339
If we were using titanium, which we could
operate to 600 degrees, the TPS weight was

623
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:20,839
going down.

624
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:27,839
Titanium was not as good a heat sink as aluminum,
even though we're working it to a higher temperature.

625
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:37,140
And it turned out that the combination of
TPS plus structure was pretty much a constant.

626
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,869
I'm oversimplifying it, but that's basically
what it was.

627
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:44,579
And you can see where the cost was.

628
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:49,000
This is beryllium titanium.

629
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,369
The cost was way out of whack compared to
everything else, so we said we're not going

630
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:55,890
to do that.

631
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:59,300
And there were some other exotic materials
over here for hot structures.

632
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,359
We said let's now decide what this airframe
material is going to be.

633
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,920
It's going to either be aluminum or titanium.

634
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:13,920
And total weight, total cost doesn't make
any difference, they're about the same.

635
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:18,390
We weren't' smart enough to decide so we went
out to the skunk works.

636
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:22,319
Kelly Johnson skunk works, I don't know if
you know what that means.

637
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:29,030
Kelly Johnson designed and built more airplanes
in a short period of time.

638
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:36,030
And they were the ones, Larry, was it in the
`50s, the SR-71 was designed, the Black Bird?

639
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:44,710
I think it was in the 1950s.

640
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:49,170
It was somewhere in there.

641
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:53,010
They had to develop titanium for that airplane.

642
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:55,470
It was a hot structure design.

643
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,740
We went out and spent some time with Kelly
Johnson.

644
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,760
We went through all this stuff with him.

645
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,710
All right, Mr.

646
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:04,260
Johnson, at the end of the day it's a mix
for us.

647
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,170
Would you build it out of aluminum or titanium?

648
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,210
He said aluminum.

649
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:15,790
And the reason being is because titanium was
so difficult to work to produce.

650
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,490
The manufacturing was difficult.

651
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:21,180
Today it's a lot less difficult than it was
then.

652
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:25,990
We made the decision and went with aluminum,
so we had to protect that structure to 350

653
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:28,150
degrees.

654
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:33,720
That was a lot of work and a lot of analysis
to make that decision.

655
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:39,520
And we talked to Aaron and said that's what
we want to do, and he said go for it.

656
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:46,319
The next thing we looked at, we got the airframe
design, now we're starting to put together

657
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,180
the fuselage.

658
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:54,280
We said we can put this crew cabin as part
of an integral part of the fuselage or we

659
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,490
can make it a separate pressure vessel inside.

660
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,260
Went through the trades on this.

661
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:04,880
And we came up with some of the discrete advantages.

662
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,560
It's a purely simple pressure vessel when
you don't have any inertia loads, except the

663
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,700
mass that is inside the crew module itself.

664
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:18,650
There is a discrete attachment between the
crew module and the forward fuselage which

665
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:24,180
means you could start the design and construction
of these two things in parallel.

666
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,540
And simple interfaces are important.

667
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:30,970
Somebody mentioned modularity, and it's probably
modularity in some analytical tools.

668
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:37,970
But simple interfaces where you're putting
things together are extremely important.

669
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,790
So, this created a very simple interface for
us.

670
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:45,109
Also, we didn't have a lot of heat transfer
to the crew module.

671
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:49,099
It was easy to control the environment within
the crew module.

672
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:56,099
And we designed it out of a material, a 2219
aluminum, which had an inherent advantage

673
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:03,020
of if it gets a crack, the crack doesn't grow
catastrophically under the operating stress

674
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,750
before it starts leaking a lot.

675
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:11,450
Well, that's good because, from a crew safety
standpoint, you know that if the seals are

676
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:15,720
working and it's still leaking you've got
a crack in that pressure vessel but it's not

677
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:22,720
going to be a crack that is going to propagate
to be a catastrophic failure.

678
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,970
We chose the floating design.

679
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:32,970
When I talked a while ago about the crew of
seven in two weeks now compared to four for

680
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:40,400
seven days, back in '72 we said we don't know
what the requirements are going to be, but

681
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:47,069
let's make this thing as robust as we can
without penalizing ourselves weight-wise.

682
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:52,849
So, we went back to Apollo and said what were
all the densities in the Command Module for

683
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:53,460
the Crew Module?

684
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,430
We figured out a density and a volume.

685
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:58,190
We said that will be our baseline.

686
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:59,930
That's what we came up with.

687
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:06,930
Well, for another 50 pounds of weight, we
could increase the carrying capability of

688
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,190
the crew module by about 500 pounds.

689
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:13,380
That was a good trade at that time so we did
it.

690
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,069
We just said we're going to design this thing.

691
00:48:15,069 --> 00:48:22,069
Instead of for 25,000 pounds we'll design
it for 30,000 pounds of payload carrying capability

692
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,619
within the crew module.

693
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:26,020
It turned out to be a good decision.

694
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:31,760
We weren't smart enough to know operationally
we'll need larger crews for a longer period

695
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,030
of time, but that helped us out a lot.

696
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:43,030
You probably also want to mention, when you
look at the structure of the crew cabin, in

697
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:53,319
both of the shuttle disasters, the Challenger
and Columbia, we have every indication that

698
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,430
the crew cabin actually survived the breakup
of the Orbiter.

699
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,069
So, it really was an excellent structure.

700
00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:01,319
I'm glad you brought that up.

701
00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:02,829
As a matter of fact, I have a note here to
bring it up myself.

702
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:09,829
Jeff is exactly right that that's what it
did, but it was never designed to be a crew

703
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,900
escape module.

704
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:20,760
It had some inherent capabilities, probably
could survive some things that it couldn't

705
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:26,099
had it been part of the fuselage, different
flight regime, so it had that inherent capability.

706
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:33,099
But it was never designed -- And I know there
was a lot of talk after Challenger that it

707
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:41,050
looked like it would have survived all the
way, but it would have never made it all the

708
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:41,300
way.

709
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:47,940
But it would have under a lot of conditions.

710
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:53,630
We said Apollo didn't have a lot of thermal
stress issues, but we know this vehicle now

711
00:49:53,630 --> 00:50:00,630
we've skinnied down weight-wise as much as
we can to the extent that the thermal gradients

712
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,520
between any two different pieces of structure,
where they were different materials or different

713
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,359
masses is going to cause a thermal gradient.

714
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:13,329
And thermal gradient cause thermal stresses.

715
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:16,740
And you will see in a minute that was not
only important to stress but is important

716
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,640
to all these tiles we were sticking on the
outside of this thing.

717
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:25,200
So we said we have to look at every one of
these thermal gradients and we have to understand

718
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,220
what that induced stress is because we had
an indication it was going to probably contribute

719
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,390
about 30% of the total stress in the vehicle.

720
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,410
It was going to be from thermal stressors
at different flight regimes.

721
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:41,410
Kelly Johnson helped us out pretty well deciding
on aluminum and titanium.

722
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,420
We said why don't we just fix this thing?

723
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,160
We'll design around all the thermal stress.

724
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,770
We'll put stress relief in it, like expansion
joints along the sidewalk.

725
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:55,780
We'll do all these kinds of cute things and
we'll simplify the heck out of this.

726
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:02,780
As a matter of fact, the SR-71, the Black
Bird, it had huge thermal stress problems.

727
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:09,890
So the wing on an SR-71, normally the skin
carries a lot of the wing bending.

728
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:11,920
Not true on an SR-71.

729
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,490
It's corrugated skin so it can expand and
contract.

730
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:21,490
All the wing bending is carried in the spar
caps, the frames that go out the entire wing,

731
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:23,210
and the caps themselves.

732
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:26,849
They paid a penalty but avoided the thermal
stress issue.

733
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:28,420
We said we'll be smart with that.

734
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,190
We'll go talk to the SR-71 guys.

735
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:32,319
And we'll go talk to the Concorde.

736
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:37,380
The Concorde was an airplane that had high
thermal stress, even though it wasn't that

737
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,809
high a temperature.

738
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:44,800
I think it was reaching 500 or 600 degrees
outside, but it was moving fuel around all

739
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,700
over the vehicle.

740
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:50,569
So when it moved this high mass of fuel from
one part of the vehicle to the other, it was

741
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:51,790
creating big thermal stresses.

742
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,329
They knew what to do.

743
00:51:54,329 --> 00:51:59,660
They designed in stress relief at these high
points.

744
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,540
It bit them.

745
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,309
Every time they did it they had fatigue failures.

746
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:04,250
Every time they did that.

747
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,490
They finally gave up and said just accommodate.

748
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,849
We said we'll do that.

749
00:52:09,849 --> 00:52:13,490
Now then, we decided on that criteria.

750
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:16,730
We're going to account for thermal stress,
but how can we do it?

751
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:23,730
We don't have a 3D model that we can apply
mechanical loads to, I'll call aero loads

752
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:27,520
mechanical loads, and temperature distribution.

753
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,119
The finite element model didn't exist.

754
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:34,349
We had a finite element model that had 50,000
degrees of freedom, but we didn't have a computing

755
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:38,730
capability to combine thermal and mechanical
loads on there at the same time to be able

756
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,970
to decide how to size the structure.

757
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:44,300
We said now we've got a problem.

758
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,450
What the hell are we going to do about that?

759
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:52,450
What we did is looked at what were the conditions
causing the thermal stress?

760
00:52:57,559 --> 00:52:59,440
Going uphill thermal stress is not an issue.

761
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,410
It's all coming back in, in the entry phase.

762
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:08,089
We knew we had initial conditions that were
going to primarily be the cause of it.

763
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:12,030
Coming back where the vehicle had been sitting
in top sun for a long time, bottom sun for

764
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:17,569
a long time, side sun for a long time, so
we looked at those initial conditions as being

765
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:17,980
the worse.

766
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,670
And we proved to ourselves that it was the
worst.

767
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:27,650
Then what we cleverly did is we went around
the vehicle where we had a detailed structural

768
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:28,890
model of a lot of stuff.

769
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:35,790
And we created a hundred different thermal
models of different types of structure.

770
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,500
This is one that was in the wing truss.

771
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:42,450
We had a wing skin panel, we had a truss member
and a lower wing skin panel.

772
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:46,630
And we did a detailed thermal analysis of
these hundred models.

773
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:53,630
We then applied that to a structural model
simplified, which was giving us the internal

774
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:59,470
loads and stresses that we needed, and then
we hand extrapolated that over the entire

775
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,990
vehicle.

776
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,230
There was no other way to do it.

777
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:10,069
So, as you look at your analytical capability
probably on your damn laptop now, computing

778
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:15,369
capability, you couldn't really do it on that,
but think about that.

779
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:19,440
And I noticed nobody wants to talk about structures
as one of these groups.

780
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,339
If one of you changes then I'm going to feel
really good when I go back and fight the hurricane

781
00:54:24,339 --> 00:54:27,119
in Texas.

782
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,780
But that's the way we did that.

783
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:35,809
It was a necessity that we had, but we didn't
have the capability so we invented a way to

784
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:36,869
do it.

785
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:41,210
And, I'll show you in a minute, it worked.

786
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:43,869
Another issue that we had.

787
00:54:43,869 --> 00:54:48,369
Normally you'd like to just vent everything
through one area in the vehicle, but we couldn't

788
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:51,869
do that because the payload bay had to be
very clean.

789
00:54:51,869 --> 00:54:53,960
It had to be contamination free.

790
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,140
And there was hydrogen in the backend of the
vehicle.

791
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:01,500
There was a pressure vessel in the front-end
and a bulkhead up there.

792
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:07,299
We said what we've got to do is we have dictated
to ourselves that we have to design a venting

793
00:55:07,299 --> 00:55:08,190
system.

794
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:12,970
This turned out to be a major part of a lot
of internal loads in the vehicle because of

795
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,960
venting from one compartment to the other.

796
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,130
And, stop and think about it, we had vents
all along the fuselage.

797
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:23,180
We had a different pressure coefficient at
each one of these vents for our various attitudes

798
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:29,319
during ascent, for our various attitudes during
entry, so we now had a whole myriad of complicated

799
00:55:29,319 --> 00:55:31,730
internal pressures that we had to accommodate.

800
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,640
But that was pretty straightforward.

801
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:39,059
We just complicated our design with the venting
system that we had, but we had to do it to

802
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:39,839
meet the requirement.

803
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,230
I don't know that people are actually aware
that there are all these vent doors because

804
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:48,230
it's not something that you would normally
pay attention to in the pictures.

805
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,549
That's right, you don't.

806
00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:56,210
As a matter of fact, in this book that Jeff
referenced, it shows where all the vent doors

807
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:59,770
are.

808
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:01,280
I didn't show that detail to you today.

809
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:08,280
And they do open and close at different times
during ascent and entry.

810
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,520
Venting just for carbon dioxide gases?

811
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:12,770
No.

812
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,619
When you start off you're at one atmosphere,
right?

813
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:20,619
As you rapidly go uphill there's a delta p
across internal bulkheads and internal compartments,

814
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,760
internal and outside the vehicle.

815
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,710
And, depending on what the flight regime is
and where the shockwave is and where the vent

816
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:33,750
door is, it's changing the whole venting thing.

817
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,329
That's a whole lecture in itself on what we
did.

818
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:43,329
The crew compartment is designed to have a
delta pressure of one atmosphere, but inside

819
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:48,540
the payload bay, that's not designed to be
a pressurized environment.

820
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:55,540
And so you need to be sure that the air can
get out of the payload bay fast enough that

821
00:56:56,490 --> 00:57:03,490
you don't over-pressurize, for instance, the
payload bay doors or other parts of the structure.

822
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,530
There were some other trades that we had to
make.

823
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:12,210
Let me skip forward so you can better understand
this.

824
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:19,210
For reference purposes, the main engines are
here, 1.5 million pounds of thrust coming

825
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:27,440
into this part of the vehicle.

826
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,290
There is a Longeron that goes all the way
along here.

827
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:32,329
A big mass up here with a crew module.

828
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:37,210
And the crew module, I showed you, had just
discrete attachment points.

829
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:43,910
All of the ascent inertia loads are reacted
right here, so all these loads go along this

830
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:44,730
Longeron.

831
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:51,730
Now, all of a sudden we have a very good and
efficient load path.

832
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:56,270
The wing right here, this is a primary load
carrying member of the wing.

833
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:57,660
That's a spar.

834
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:01,390
And it ties into this big bulkhead which is
right here.

835
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:08,390
When Jeff talks about the pressure differential,
don't forget this thing is 15 feet in diameter

836
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,540
here so you can imagine the total loads you
have on that with a couple of psi delta p.

837
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,349
It's big.

838
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:24,329
That was a significant part of the driving
stresses in that.

839
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:30,619
Another point I want to make about this is
-- Well, I talked about simple interfaces

840
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:37,619
between the crew module and the forward fuselage
with bolted attachments.

841
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:43,299
We had a simple interface between the wing
and the mid fuselage.

842
00:58:43,299 --> 00:58:47,380
A simple interface between the mid fuselage
and the aft fuselage.

843
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:52,559
The same thing with the vertical stabilizer
and aft fuselage and these orbital maneuvering

844
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,260
propulsion system.

845
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:01,750
That was important, from a structural point
of view, to be able to modularize and analyze

846
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,160
these things.

847
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:08,790
But it was also important because four different
contractors built all these parts so they

848
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:13,180
had to have an interface that they could not
only design and analyze to but that they could

849
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:16,549
physically attach to.

850
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:21,450
Sometimes, when you have just a sketch on
a piece of paper, you don't think about that.

851
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:28,450
And it does cause a little bit of complexity
sometimes in a program.

852
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:34,530
The main thrust structure is carrying 1.5
million pounds of load from the engines.

853
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:35,450
How do we design that?

854
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:39,819
Well, we could have done a space frame or
we could have done a truss configuration.

855
00:59:39,819 --> 00:59:45,670
We decided to go with the space frame or the
truss rather than a plate girder, the term

856
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:48,030
I didn't use correctly.

857
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:51,980
And with that we saved 1700 pounds of weight
in the vehicle.

858
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,780
We used titanium.

859
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:58,240
And this is a compression design.

860
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,099
We thought we needed to get a little bit more
weight out of this thing.

861
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:04,970
What can we do to increase the compression
modulus of titanium?

862
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:11,970
We put boron/epoxy, scabbed it on the axial
load members of the thrust structure, and

863
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:18,030
that's the way we got a lot of that weight
out.

864
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:23,170
That was a manufacturing problem, I won't
go into now, of how you build this thrust

865
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:28,640
structure, but it works fine.

866
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,170
The aft wing carried through -- Excuse me.

867
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:31,869
Go ahead.

868
01:00:31,869 --> 01:00:32,150
I just had a quick question.

869
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:32,400
Sure.

870
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:39,200
We heard earlier that there was a CG problem
in that the CG was too far forward in the

871
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,819
aft [but bled in the back?] for a number a
number of missions.

872
01:00:43,819 --> 01:00:46,619
I was wondering how that weight that they
had to add to the CG compared to the weight

873
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:48,299
that you guys saved.

874
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:52,280
The weight of the payloads themselves, you're
saying that there was a problem if heavy weights

875
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,130
were too far aft or too far forward?

876
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:55,640
The Orbiter.

877
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:01,490
I guess the CG location was too far forward
and they had to adjust it on certain missions

878
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:05,990
by adding weight near the back.

879
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:10,109
Well, what that is, that is true and that's
a problem.

880
01:01:10,109 --> 01:01:11,240
It's not a problem.

881
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,240
It's something that has to be addressed on
every mission, depending on what the payload

882
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,089
is that you're carrying.

883
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:22,240
If you have a real heavy forward payload,
yeah, you have to add some ballast to the

884
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,210
aft end of the thing.

885
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:27,270
Now, normally the way they do it is they'll
find some payload that can fit in the aft

886
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:28,240
end to help ballast that.

887
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:33,079
But I think, in some of the early flights,
we put some ballast in the back for CG control.

888
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:40,079
We've carried many tons of lead into orbit,
so it was ballasting the thing for control

889
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,099
purposes.

890
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:49,900
The same way yesterday in Jet Blue, a lot
of people had to move to the back end of the

891
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:56,900
airplane because they wanted that CG for a
little bit different landing performance.

892
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,750
1307 bulkhead, we saved about 500 pounds there.

893
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,890
Now, see what we're doing?

894
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:07,440
We started out with the initial trades in
the early concept phases.

895
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,329
What's the wing loading?

896
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:13,799
We didn't care about what the internal structure
trades were.

897
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:20,660
Now we're getting down to trading all the
stuff at a semi-macro level.

898
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:25,280
And I'll show you in a minute a micro-level
that we had to get into, which was pretty

899
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,230
interesting.

900
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:27,680
How are we doing time-wise?

901
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,380
We're OK.

902
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,660
So, we saved some weight there.

903
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:37,660
An interesting thing about the payload bay
doors.

904
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:44,730
We decided that for this vehicle to be safe
and to re-enter those doors had to close.

905
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:54,640
We had a lot of trouble in Gemini with things
on orbit not working.

906
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,839
Mechanical systems quite often are problems.

907
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,859
Docking systems are problems.

908
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:04,400
There have been a lot of door problems on
orbit in spacecraft.

909
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,839
And you design them and you put them in thermal
vacuum chambers and they all work, but you

910
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,960
get on orbit and sometimes they don't work.

911
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,220
Maybe it's thermal distortion that we're not
accounting for.

912
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,980
So, we said that is critical.

913
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:16,859
We've got to close these payload bay doors.

914
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:23,510
What we did was say the way we're going to
do that is the payload doors will carry only

915
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:24,450
two types of load.

916
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:31,450
They will carry pressure loads, like Jeff
talked about, and they'll carry torsion loads.

917
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:37,799
Because, if they are closed, we know that
it is good for torsion in the vehicle, reacting

918
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:39,359
torsional loads.

919
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:44,160
But we will not let them carry body bending
loads or else we cannot make them flexible

920
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:44,500
enough.

921
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:51,500
What we did is all of the body bending in
this vehicle is carried along this Longeron

922
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:56,150
through this section in the lower skin of
the vehicle.

923
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:01,309
This is the modulus of the vehicle, if you
will, at a cross-section here between this

924
01:04:01,309 --> 01:04:03,280
Longeron and the lower skin.

925
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,160
Payload bay doors don't come into being.

926
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:12,160
And the way the doors close on orbit is they
start zipping along from here up to the top

927
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:14,970
because they are flexible.

928
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:21,240
And the same way back here, they zip closed,
zipping just a latch at a time.

929
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,720
They were sort of ratcheting themselves closed.

930
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,700
And then they close along the center line.

931
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:30,869
There has never been a problem with payload
bay door closures on orbit.

932
01:04:30,869 --> 01:04:34,730
It was something we decided to add to the
design.

933
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:40,559
We could have made the vehicle lighter had
we not done that, but we would have also complicated

934
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:46,930
the safety of the vehicle if we had done it.

935
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:53,930
Sort of in line, but it's not the CG thing,
we had a payload attachment issue.

936
01:04:54,859 --> 01:05:01,859
And, when we were laying out all this stuff
in the early `70s, we didn't know what the

937
01:05:03,849 --> 01:05:04,349
payloads were.

938
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:06,910
We knew what the total mass was.

939
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:09,599
We knew there may be five at a time.

940
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,180
We didn't know what they were.

941
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:17,609
Now, you can just go in and bolt a payload
into the fuselage of the Orbiter.

942
01:05:17,609 --> 01:05:22,849
And if you just do that randomly or without
thinking about it, now all of a sudden you

943
01:05:22,849 --> 01:05:27,109
start analyzing the Orbiter and you start
twisting it, what happens?

944
01:05:27,109 --> 01:05:29,410
The payload becomes part of the load path.

945
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:34,349
Now, all of a sudden, you have impacted the
design of the payload or maybe you have impacted

946
01:05:34,349 --> 01:05:37,400
the design of the Orbiter depending on what
is happening in the payload.

947
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,849
We said ah-ha, what we'll do is make it so
it's statically determinant.

948
01:05:41,849 --> 01:05:48,150
If two things are attached statically determinately
they cannot interact with one another as far

949
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:50,910
as their stiffnesses are concerned.

950
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:52,440
We said that's what we're going to do.

951
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:58,369
We'll put attachments along the Longerons
to carry the axial loads, some along the keel

952
01:05:58,369 --> 01:05:59,920
to carry some of the lateral loads.

953
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,569
Viola, we've got it.

954
01:06:01,569 --> 01:06:05,849
So, the requirement became that we would design
it that way.

955
01:06:05,849 --> 01:06:11,789
Our next step was, and you can ask Al Louviere
when he comes up about that because Al Louviere

956
01:06:11,789 --> 01:06:17,410
and Max Faget told me they would never fly
with those Longerons that way.

957
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:20,319
We did it anyway.

958
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:24,030
What we had to do then was say now we understand
what the attachment is.

959
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:30,920
How do we determine within the CG constraints
for these different masses -- And we had to

960
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,220
assume what they were not knowing exactly
the definition of the payloads.

961
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,809
We did a Monte Carlo analysis.

962
01:06:36,809 --> 01:06:40,730
Ten million cases of combined payloads.

963
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:44,510
CG locations, numbers of payloads, forward,
aft, all that.

964
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:46,319
And we did that with a Monte Carlo analysis.

965
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,970
We said voila, that's where we're going to
design the mid fuselage.

966
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:55,609
That's the way we did it.

967
01:06:55,609 --> 01:06:58,940
Now getting into the detail design loads.

968
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,680
How do we determine all these things now?

969
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:04,789
Because now it's coming down to sizing the
vehicle.

970
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:11,789
This part of the flight regime from liftoff
through max Q, that's a critical loading condition,

971
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:18,510
a critical design for the Orbiter.

972
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:21,809
When it gets into orbit pretty benign.

973
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:26,799
Nothing is really happening up there except
some temperatures which are going to be important

974
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:32,030
at this point over here, because now all of
a sudden you start adding more heat into it.

975
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:36,950
Now you get into the regime where you're maneuvering
in the atmosphere.

976
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:41,520
Now you're in a different loading regime which
becomes critical.

977
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:48,520
So, critical as far as the airframe is concerned,
is here and over here only.

978
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,799
Let me break that down into the constituent
portions there.

979
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,440
Liftoff loads.

980
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:00,500
We had another statistical challenge here
because what we had to do was needed to look

981
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:04,270
at all the variables associated with the rocket
engines.

982
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:05,520
They have start sequences.

983
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,869
We've got three main engines that are not
going to start exactly the same time.

984
01:08:08,869 --> 01:08:15,410
They're not going to come up with the same
thrust profile as they start up.

985
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:18,710
The thrust vector misalignment is going to
be different.

986
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:21,279
And we also had to look at ignition over pressure.

987
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,259
And I'll show you that was a surprise to us.

988
01:08:24,259 --> 01:08:30,279
Also part of liftoff we had to look at winds
and gusts, vortex shedding, proximity of aerodynamics

989
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:35,440
to the other structures is on the gantry in
the pad.

990
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:41,819
And then we had to do the pressurization and
also look at shrinkage of these vehicles that

991
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:46,080
components or elements at cryo-temperatures.

992
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:52,940
Here was a cross-section, in a generic sense,
of what's happening during liftoff.

993
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:57,980
There is some combination of winds that you
have to account for.

994
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,560
And I will show you what we did there.

995
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,609
The thrust profile from the SSMEs.

996
01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:09,480
The SRBs come up to thrust after you get confirmation
that the engines are operating at full performance.

997
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:14,400
And there is a lot of vibration acceleration
going on.

998
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,980
Here is something that becomes pretty obvious
after a while.

999
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:25,440
When you have a vehicle that is tied down
here with a base moment and you put 1.5 million

1000
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,730
pounds of thrust on it, this vehicle is going
to bend over this way.

1001
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:35,319
There is a lot of strained energy in the solid
rocket motors when that happens.

1002
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:42,319
If you were to ignite the SRBs, when that
vehicle is over here, the party is over because

1003
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:47,210
it releases all that strained energy and the
SRBs couldn't take it.

1004
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:54,049
When you see the Orbiter prior to liftoff,
the SSMEs will come up, you will see the vehicle

1005
01:09:54,049 --> 01:09:55,190
do like this.

1006
01:09:55,190 --> 01:10:00,170
And then, when it comes back over zero, viola,
you kick off the SRBs.

1007
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:06,060
But you have to wait until it gets back to
that neutral point.

1008
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,230
A little detail that is pretty important.

1009
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:13,340
Ascent.

1010
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:20,340
A really complicated part of the design of
the vehicle, especially with the aerodynamic

1011
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:25,820
surfaces.

1012
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:29,520
As I said before, you would like for these
things not to be there during ascent.

1013
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,050
They don't buy you anything.

1014
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:35,610
You just need them coming back.

1015
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:42,610
Some other complications here are the acoustic
effects will become important, as I'll show

1016
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:47,050
you, in acoustic fatigue for the vehicle.

1017
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:48,110
I showed you life.

1018
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,380
Well, that's going to be a critical thing.

1019
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:56,400
Another thing is the plumes of the vehicle
are changing the pressure distribution as

1020
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,630
you're going up.

1021
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:04,150
The pressure distribution along the Orbiter,
especially the wing, is changing the whole

1022
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:08,989
times you're accelerating, not only through
the various mach regimes but also because

1023
01:11:08,989 --> 01:11:13,300
of the blockage from the plume expansion.

1024
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,460
We said how in the world are going to do that?

1025
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:17,860
We cannot analyze all those things.

1026
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:24,840
If we do it deterministically, you won't get
a capability that you need, we thought, operational.

1027
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:30,630
We said what we'll do is one piece of data
that we had, we had synthetic wind profiles

1028
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:32,800
for everything that existed at the Cape.

1029
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,030
We said that's a given.

1030
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:40,280
We'll use these synthetic wind profiles as
a guideline to all of our winds aloft.

1031
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:46,480
What we need to do is decide what the angle
of attack and the side slip is going to be

1032
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,860
through this vehicle flying through these
winds and a control system that's changing

1033
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:52,770
the attitude of the vehicle.

1034
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:57,850
That's a factor that we have to consider and
that's going to be important for the design

1035
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:01,420
of the elevon surfaces and all because they're
getting loaded up pretty heavily at that time.

1036
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:08,420
There are dispersions in the propulsion system
that have to be added.

1037
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:15,600
And then what we decided to do, after we looked
at all that, we said what we're going to do

1038
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:21,560
is we're going to take all these parameters,
and you won't find this in any textbook, but

1039
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,300
we created something called a squatcheloid.

1040
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,260
And I forgot to look up what squatcheloid
means.

1041
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,610
It must be a Greek term that was really good.

1042
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:35,150
But what we did was flew the vehicle through
different mach numbers.

1043
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:42,150
And we looked at the various conditions we
could get at for combinations of dynamic pressure

1044
01:12:44,179 --> 01:12:50,440
and angle of attack and dynamic pressure and
side slip for all the mach numbers, and then

1045
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:56,969
we said is that realistic to do, not only
from a control systems standpoint but from

1046
01:12:56,969 --> 01:12:59,260
a standpoint of the propulsion system capability?

1047
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:05,780
And we said it is feasible to do so we ought
to design within those envelopes.

1048
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:12,390
What we did was walked our way around all
of these external points with pressure and

1049
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:17,310
inertial loads and everything else and we
looked at the structural model that we had

1050
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:17,750
simplified.

1051
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:22,000
And we said we found the points that were
critical for the vertical stabilizer, for

1052
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:28,860
the outboard elevon, et cetera, and that's
the way we designed the vehicle for ascent

1053
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,130
loads.

1054
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:37,130
The thing that that enabled us to do, too,
is it enabled us to do a rational combination

1055
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,960
that Aaron brought up a while ago.

1056
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,830
What did you do with the SSMEs for engine
out and that kind of stuff?

1057
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:49,830
It let us do a rational combination of engine
out and also engine vector control.

1058
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:57,400
You could design the thrust structure so that
the engines went out to the extremes, but

1059
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,150
it didn't make sense as far as the control
system was concerned.

1060
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:05,710
What we did is we saved a lot of weight in
the vehicle by using a deterministic or realistic,

1061
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:12,710
I should say, SSME thrust profile and vector
characteristics.

1062
01:14:16,489 --> 01:14:18,790
Well, I just mention that.

1063
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:21,690
That's what the squatcheloid did for it.

1064
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:28,130
Also what it did was then gave the guys who
were designing ascent trajectories, now they

1065
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:35,130
had an envelope to design to, which was key
for their operations.

1066
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:36,770
Next problem.

1067
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:38,400
Now we come back to descent loads.

1068
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:45,400
When you said that you designed it for realistic
cases instead of worst cases, does that mean

1069
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,480
the engines were never able to vector all
the way out to maximum?

1070
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:53,730
Right.

1071
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:56,980
It just could not happen?

1072
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:57,699
It could not happen.

1073
01:14:57,699 --> 01:15:01,370
That was a failure mode that it had enough
redundancy and it couldn't happen, and there

1074
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:04,610
wasn't any need of creating a load condition
like that.

1075
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:05,190
It couldn't happen.

1076
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:08,650
OK, so you looked for it.

1077
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:14,440
We looked for the cases where you could be
in the worst case winds, the worst case misalignment

1078
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:18,860
with the SRB, with the different throttling
of the engines.

1079
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:23,659
And we did all that and said to control this
vehicle, because if you cannot control the

1080
01:15:23,659 --> 01:15:26,250
vehicle there's no need to look at that load
case.

1081
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:31,840
We said to control it within those environments,
what's the extreme of the engines?

1082
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:37,900
We said that's a design case for the thrust
structure.

1083
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,449
Good question.

1084
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:44,449
Descent loads.

1085
01:15:44,449 --> 01:15:45,489
This was pretty easy.

1086
01:15:45,489 --> 01:15:49,780
The structure guys said this is a piece of
cake because this vehicle is coming back in,

1087
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:53,260
in a ballistic trajectory.

1088
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:55,710
And, viola, there are not even loads on this
vehicle.

1089
01:15:55,710 --> 01:16:00,030
Well, that didn't make a whole lot of sense
because we knew that there would have to be

1090
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:03,840
more maneuvering capability than anybody was
fessing up to.

1091
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:09,460
Not that they weren't trying to hide it, but
we weren't smart enough.

1092
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:14,380
The Aaron Cohen guys weren't smart enough
to know all the conditions we would have to

1093
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:14,860
fly it to.

1094
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:21,860
What we did was we went through the classical
Venn diagram where you're plotting for different

1095
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:28,100
mach numbers.

1096
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:34,230
The normal load factor versus the velocity
of the vehicle that it can fly in that flight

1097
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:35,710
regime.

1098
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:40,760
We said if this thing is going to behave like
an airplane and have to perform like an airplane,

1099
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,810
we are going to design it like an airplane.

1100
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:44,370
We caught a lot of guff.

1101
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:50,150
When Bass Redd comes in and talks in the future
ask him about this because he fought us on

1102
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:52,340
this hand and foot.

1103
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:54,690
He said you guys don't have to design it that
way.

1104
01:16:54,690 --> 01:17:00,010
We said well, we're going to, but let him
have capability in his aerodynamics and talk

1105
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:02,170
to the control system guys about that, too.

1106
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:05,760
And I see the Draper guys left on that.

1107
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:12,210
[LAUGHTER] We said we're going to build in
that capability for this thing to maneuver

1108
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:12,900
like an airplane.

1109
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,610
2.5 g's normal load factor.

1110
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:21,110
Follow-up classical Venn diagram where we
have equivalent airspeed of 375 psf.

1111
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:27,380
We were determining what the equivalent air
speed for those conditions was.

1112
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:31,909
And then we did it.

1113
01:17:31,909 --> 01:17:38,460
Now we've gotten up to a point I'll call CDR,
and a point I should have mentioned a while

1114
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,449
ago.

1115
01:17:39,449 --> 01:17:46,210
When I showed the authority to proceed, there
aren't any drawings which exist, except some

1116
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:46,929
sketches.

1117
01:17:46,929 --> 01:17:50,270
I mean there are mol line drawings and that's
about it.

1118
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:54,429
And the mol line of the vehicle was what came
out of all the other studies.

1119
01:17:54,429 --> 01:17:58,610
It said that's it, we've got to put everything
within this mol line for this vehicle to perform

1120
01:17:58,610 --> 01:17:59,860
like it is.

1121
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,719
But there are no detailed drawings.

1122
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:06,850
When you get to a preliminary design review
in a classical design and development program,

1123
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:13,659
typically that's about where you reach 10%
of your drawings that are released.

1124
01:18:13,659 --> 01:18:15,440
And what does it mean to release a drawing?

1125
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:22,440
That means you sign it off, whatever your
discipline is, and it say we can make this

1126
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:28,630
airplane to these drawings and it's given
to the people to go make it.

1127
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:33,179
So, once you release a drawing you don't ever
want to bring it back and change it because

1128
01:18:33,179 --> 01:18:34,600
it costs you a lot of money.

1129
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:41,600
The PDR, which was somewhere like about '73,
'74, somewhere like that, that was the state

1130
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:45,920
which we existed.

1131
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:50,330
We hadn't defined everything on the structural
low pass like I told you about a while ago,

1132
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:52,260
nor the materials.

1133
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,570
Now we're at the detail design.

1134
01:18:53,570 --> 01:19:00,469
Now we're into CDR, that's the critical design
review, and 90% of all your drawings are released.

1135
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:03,989
And now it gets very expensive to go back
and change.

1136
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:09,060
You can just see how it would ripple through
the entire operation if you change a drawing

1137
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:09,590
at that time.

1138
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:13,570
You have to, to make it work sometimes, but
you like not to change it.

1139
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:18,020
What we have to do here, our challenge from
a structural point of view is to complete

1140
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:22,659
the design, do some of the details which means
get weight out of the vehicle where you can

1141
01:19:22,659 --> 01:19:25,179
scrape it without really changing a lot of
stuff.

1142
01:19:25,179 --> 01:19:29,020
And then also decide how you're going to certify
the vehicle.

1143
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:34,900
It means what you're going to do on the ground
to say it's really safe for the crew to get

1144
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,340
in.

1145
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:37,010
That's what that was.

1146
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:41,730
Weight reduction is a major part of the program.

1147
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:44,850
Here are some of the things that we took out
about this timeframe.

1148
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:48,340
We took out 900 pounds of weight in the payload
bay doors.

1149
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:54,469
We didn't change the configuration, they were
still flexible, but they were aluminum honeycomb.

1150
01:19:54,469 --> 01:19:57,710
We said we can save 900 pounds if we go to
graphite/epoxy.

1151
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:03,530
Graphite/epoxy characterization of the material
didn't even exist then.

1152
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:08,270
Literally Aaron, myself and three or four
other guys sat around.

1153
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:12,659
We said OK, Aaron, this is what we have, this
is what we know about it, here are the risks

1154
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:15,040
associated and here is the weight savings.

1155
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,120
Go for it.

1156
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,929
So, we went for it and it worked.

1157
01:20:17,929 --> 01:20:21,659
That was the largest graphite/epoxy structure
ever flown.

1158
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:26,510
We characterized it, passed that on to the
industry and that helped a bunch.

1159
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:30,810
Another little interesting thing -- I have
to watch my time here.

1160
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:34,350
I mentioned the spending profile.

1161
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:40,010
Well, we got into the program about the time
we were starting to make the payload bay doors,

1162
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:43,560
which is probably '75, '76.

1163
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,750
And Aaron didn't get all the money that he
needed.

1164
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:53,750
We built the first set of payload bay doors,
which is people process dependant.

1165
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:55,870
It's like laying up fiberglass.

1166
01:20:55,870 --> 01:21:00,239
It was all hand layup with epoxy and bake
it and all that kind of stuff.

1167
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:05,190
We got the first set built and we fired everybody
because we didn't have enough money to keep

1168
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:07,290
them on the payroll for the rest of that year.

1169
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:13,150
We literally laid everybody off at Rockwell
in Tulsa.

1170
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:17,650
And they came back a year later, not all of
them, but we had to start over again.

1171
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:21,100
So, there is a risk associated with that.

1172
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:21,690
Thrust structure.

1173
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:26,670
We saved 1200 pounds by stiffening, like I
told you about a while ago.

1174
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:31,199
And then we used a bunch of other composites.

1175
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:36,030
A lot of people said, especially after Challenger,
let's get rid of this vehicle because it's

1176
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:37,900
antiquated and was designed too long ago.

1177
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:44,900
That probably is still one of the most advanced
composite structure vehicles flying today.

1178
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:51,880
Except, where there is a lot of aluminum honeycomb,
you probably could go with graphite/epoxy.

1179
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,110
And I will give you a challenge with that
later on.

1180
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:59,670
But there are beryllium aluminum struts in
here.

1181
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:03,260
There are boron/epoxy scab on devices.

1182
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:05,949
There is graphite/epoxy all over the vehicle.

1183
01:22:05,949 --> 01:22:07,110
Not all over the vehicle.

1184
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:08,800
In a lot of places in the vehicle.

1185
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,380
The vehicle has got a lot of composites.

1186
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:17,060
And we stretched to be able to do that.

1187
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:17,540
Certification.

1188
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:20,429
Now we've got the thing pretty well designed.

1189
01:22:20,429 --> 01:22:22,870
What are we going to do to certify this thing?

1190
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:27,590
This is where we deviated from the norm and
were pretty innovative.

1191
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:34,590
Classically, in the way this program started
off, there was a dedicated structural test

1192
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:40,190
article and there was a dedicated fatigue
test article.

1193
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:42,070
There were a couple of problems with that.

1194
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:46,940
If you don't need it, you might as well not
build it, even though that was in the program.

1195
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:52,699
The situation was, as I showed you a while
ago, thermal stress was a major part of that.

1196
01:22:52,699 --> 01:22:59,580
You couldn't apply a mechanical and thermal
load to this vehicle and still be practical.

1197
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:01,590
Concorde did it.

1198
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:08,100
The way that Concorde was designed and certified,
they applied mechanical loads in an environment

1199
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:13,020
in which they could induce the temperature
by convective heating on that vehicle.

1200
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:16,460
And it took them like three years to test
the vehicle.

1201
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:19,030
And it was extremely expensive.

1202
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:24,760
It was a big jobs program for Greg Britton
and France and some of the others, but we

1203
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:28,949
decided we couldn't afford to do that so we
are going to have to figure out how else to

1204
01:23:28,949 --> 01:23:29,219
do it.

1205
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:36,219
Besides that, Aaron had $100 million problem
that year.

1206
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:40,530
What can you guy help us do?

1207
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:47,530
What we'll do, we think we can do this, is
take an airframe and we will apply 110% of

1208
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:54,940
the limit mechanical loads only to it.

1209
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:56,989
And that doesn't certify anything.

1210
01:23:56,989 --> 01:24:00,170
And then we will put strain gauges all over
this vehicle.

1211
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:07,170
And we will pre-predict what the strain response
is going to be for 3,000 points on the vehicle.

1212
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:13,050
If we can pre-predict what the strain response
is for applying a bunch of different loads

1213
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:17,440
then we know how to analyze the vehicle.

1214
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,800
That proves we know how to analyze it.

1215
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:26,800
We can extrapolate to 140% to our ultimate
load capability from mechanical, and we will

1216
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:32,739
add the thermal stress to it analytically.

1217
01:24:32,739 --> 01:24:34,889
So, we did that.

1218
01:24:34,889 --> 01:24:39,550
And then we refurbished the vehicle and that
became Challenger.

1219
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:43,080
The test article is going to cost $100 million.

1220
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,429
We said we don't need it.

1221
01:24:44,429 --> 01:24:47,179
We'll use it for a flight airframe.

1222
01:24:47,179 --> 01:24:51,320
And Aaron gave us a little ceramic eagle for
doing it.

1223
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:57,469
Don't anybody expect As out of this deal,
if Aaron has anything to do with it.

1224
01:24:57,469 --> 01:24:57,800
There it was.

1225
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:04,800
We applied the million and a half pounds of
load at the backend.

1226
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:11,690
We concentrated through loading fixtures,
loads on the wings of the fuselage, put pressure

1227
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:18,380
differential at various points on the vehicle,
and we did exactly what I said.

1228
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:20,179
Fatigue life.

1229
01:25:20,179 --> 01:25:21,780
Mechanical fatigue was not a problem.

1230
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:26,190
Acoustic fatigue was an issue because we had
some really lightweight structures and really

1231
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:27,389
high acoustic levels.

1232
01:25:27,389 --> 01:25:29,820
You cannot see it here.

1233
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:36,820
It was like 165 DB around the base-end of
the thing, lower levels on other portions,

1234
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:39,130
so we said how are we going to do that?

1235
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:42,560
We came up with a different way to do it.

1236
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:49,560
What we will do is we'll go around the vehicle
and we will identify a characteristic structure,

1237
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:56,880
graphite/epoxy, aluminum, 7075-T6 aluminum
fuselage up here, wing elevon, aluminum honeycomb,

1238
01:25:58,310 --> 01:25:59,900
et cetera.

1239
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:03,980
We identified 44 test articles.

1240
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,870
We said that's what we'll do.

1241
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:11,550
We went to Aaron and said it's going to take
us 44 test articles.

1242
01:26:11,550 --> 01:26:18,170
We went through all the rationale with each
one of them, and he said you can have 14.

1243
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:20,199
And so we said but that won't work.

1244
01:26:20,199 --> 01:26:21,710
He said go figure it out.

1245
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,610
We went back and scratched out heads.

1246
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:26,429
Sure enough, we figured out how to do more
extrapolation.

1247
01:26:26,429 --> 01:26:29,280
So, we had 14 test articles that you see.

1248
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:33,360
And then what we did was say now we've got
our test articles.

1249
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:40,239
Our approach to this thing was we would test
them to failure acoustically.

1250
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:46,170
Now we have an acoustic allowable for that
type of structure because it's a function

1251
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:47,070
of the details.

1252
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:48,210
I mean it had to be the detail.

1253
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:54,320
And, in addition to making sure we have a
good test, if this was our acoustic fatigue

1254
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:59,070
test article, only the center third was a
viable part of the test because the rest of

1255
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:02,820
it is boundary conditions that weren't right
because they were clamped along the edges

1256
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:03,550
or whatever.

1257
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:07,719
We said only the middle third of the test
article is viable.

1258
01:27:07,719 --> 01:27:14,090
We tested that, we got a fatigue allowable
from acoustics and then we degraded it analytically

1259
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:17,449
for combined mechanical and combined thermal.

1260
01:27:17,449 --> 01:27:21,090
We did that and said also we know that it's
probably not going to fail on the first flight

1261
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:22,190
so we'll do some inspections.

1262
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:24,550
Tom, let me just make a comment.

1263
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:26,600
He made it sound a lot simpler than it was.

1264
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:31,409
One thing that's important, whenever you do
a project or you're in charge of something,

1265
01:27:31,409 --> 01:27:35,389
you don't want to have yes people around you.

1266
01:27:35,389 --> 01:27:38,929
You want to have people that say you're not
doing it right.

1267
01:27:38,929 --> 01:27:39,489
And it didn't go down that simple.

1268
01:27:39,489 --> 01:27:41,219
They were not yes people, believe me.

1269
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:45,190
They were certainly not yes, sir, we're going
to go do this.

1270
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:49,080
That's very important.

1271
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:52,429
It's a wonder we still speak to one another.

1272
01:27:52,429 --> 01:27:53,310
[LAUGHTER] I'm sorry.

1273
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,940
I don't know what a test article is.

1274
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:55,770
It's a test specimen.

1275
01:27:55,770 --> 01:28:00,850
If you wanted to put so much mass in here
and you weren't sure whether this seam was

1276
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:01,320
going to work.

1277
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,210
You just put that much mass in here.

1278
01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:05,940
You add a little bit more to it and you see
if that seam breaks.

1279
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:07,780
That's your test article.

1280
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:10,870
That's what it is, just a test specimen, test
article.

1281
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:17,870
But that's a good point because, don't forget,
we start off with two entire $100 million

1282
01:28:19,139 --> 01:28:22,870
test articles for static test and for fatigue
test.

1283
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:24,830
Not counting acoustic fatigue.

1284
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:26,580
That was just mechanical fatigue.

1285
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:30,300
As we got into it we said we don't need that.

1286
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:34,750
Did the Challenger's mission life drop because
of the test?

1287
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:35,880
No.

1288
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:39,080
As a matter of fact, that's a very good question.

1289
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:44,580
That was one of the questions that was asked
by the investigation is what's different about

1290
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:45,920
this vehicle than any other vehicles?

1291
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,489
Well, it was a static test article.

1292
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:54,489
And we showed ad nauseam that had nothing
to do with the failure of Challenger.

1293
01:28:55,650 --> 01:29:02,460
The leading edge was not -- Oh, no, excuse
me.

1294
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,780
I'm off on Columbia now.

1295
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:08,420
No, it didn't have anything to do with it.

1296
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:15,420
As a matter of fact, this is getting into
detailed details now, when you apply above

1297
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:23,760
a limit load on a vehicle like we did on Challenger
it puts a lot of the joints in residual compression.

1298
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:29,370
There is compression at the joint just as
you load it and you unload it.

1299
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:35,320
And residual compression increases the fatigue
life of the vehicle.

1300
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:40,219
And the reason it does is because fatigue
is the function of tensile cycles, not compressive

1301
01:29:40,219 --> 01:29:42,630
cycles normally.

1302
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:49,630
When McDonnell Douglas tested a DC-10 and
they proof load a vehicle, it carries a premium

1303
01:29:49,719 --> 01:29:55,610
on the selling price for that because it theoretically
has a longer life than one that hasn't been

1304
01:29:55,610 --> 01:29:56,380
loaded.

1305
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:57,550
Good question.

1306
01:29:57,550 --> 01:30:00,520
Tom, one more question.

1307
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,260
Yeah.

1308
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:04,469
How much did an increase in computer processing
speed and availability allow you to do these

1309
01:30:04,469 --> 01:30:09,889
extrapolations and like do the thermal testing
just analytically?

1310
01:30:09,889 --> 01:30:15,130
Was that a key factor?

1311
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:16,830
You mean how much as it increased?

1312
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:20,750
Well, how much did it increase between like,
say, Apollo and designing the Shuttle.

1313
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,719
Not a whole lot.

1314
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:29,080
As far as the analytical capabilities of the
finite element models and all, you could get

1315
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,710
more detail through simplification.

1316
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:34,159
There are more elements available, let me
put it that way.

1317
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:39,350
But as far as the crunching capability, it
increased somewhat but we were still, you

1318
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:43,850
know, if you have to go from here to here,
we were about here.

1319
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:46,420
That isn't a quantitative answer for you,
but we're still a long way.

1320
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:48,590
We basically used mainframes, and we did have
the NASTRAN model.

1321
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:51,389
Yeah, we had NASTRAN.

1322
01:30:51,389 --> 01:30:58,389
But NASTRAN didn't have, on a large model
like that, the large capability for structural

1323
01:30:59,889 --> 01:31:00,550
loads and thermal loads.

1324
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:07,550
But you used to put your cards in one day
and it would take a couple days before you

1325
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:09,040
got your answer.

1326
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:16,040
To do a complete load cycle on this vehicle
for internal loads it was something like three

1327
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:20,120
months it would take us to do that.

1328
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:27,120
And so it was quite [OVERLAPPING VOICES].

1329
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:28,219
That's another story.

1330
01:31:28,219 --> 01:31:30,889
Thermal protection system.

1331
01:31:30,889 --> 01:31:32,030
Change gears now.

1332
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:36,310
Let's talk about the thing that protects the
vehicle.

1333
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:43,310
Now I'm going to switch back and go back to
get ready to proceed toward preliminary design.

1334
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:46,650
What were the requirements on the thermal
protection system?

1335
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:52,820
It had to protect the vehicle from max temperatures
like about 2800 degrees on the surface, reusable

1336
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:56,300
100 times, it had to be lightweight and had
to be cost-effective.

1337
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,489
Pretty simple high-level requirements.

1338
01:31:58,489 --> 01:31:58,739
And Dr.

1339
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:05,600
Bob Ried will talk to you about the things
that they derived as far as the aerothermal

1340
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:11,260
in this and how it became that, but it was
a given to us.

1341
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:13,050
What did we know about this thing?

1342
01:32:13,050 --> 01:32:17,190
Well, we had some ablative TPS experience
from Apollo.

1343
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:24,000
Gemini had some metallic TPS on it primarily
Rene 41 and some other exotic materials.

1344
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,510
Mercury had an ablative TPS, but they weren't
reusable.

1345
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:36,179
They were hot structure designs which existed
but that we didn't have materials that could

1346
01:32:36,179 --> 01:32:41,010
carry the load at temperature such that it
could be a fully hot structural design, and

1347
01:32:41,010 --> 01:32:43,100
that was extremely complex.

1348
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:50,100
Metallic TPS, we could get there theoretically
with some fairly exotic materials called columbium

1349
01:32:51,310 --> 01:32:58,310
and Rene 41 and some other things, but the
devil is in the detail in that.

1350
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:03,850
Let me tell you a story about that.

1351
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:07,719
We were looking at some Haynes 188 panels.

1352
01:33:07,719 --> 01:33:13,940
And so we had a test article, a big panel
about the size of the desk that you're sitting

1353
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:19,889
at, any one of you there, and it was corrugated
so that it could expand and contract.

1354
01:33:19,889 --> 01:33:26,610
And it was good for 1800 degrees, so we tested
it to 1800 degrees in the center of the panel

1355
01:33:26,610 --> 01:33:27,489
multiple times.

1356
01:33:27,489 --> 01:33:34,370
And it had a frame around it where the panel
could move around because it needed to, to

1357
01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:36,760
be able to thermally expand.

1358
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:42,780
And the center of the panel was 1800 degrees,
the edge of the panel where the heat sink

1359
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:47,080
was, was 40 degrees lower temperature than
the center.

1360
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:54,080
And the panel floated within a gap maybe about
like that, so it could move around pretty

1361
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:55,580
good.

1362
01:33:55,580 --> 01:34:00,840
But what it also did, with that temperature
differential of 40 degrees, we got something

1363
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,699
called creep buckling.

1364
01:34:02,699 --> 01:34:08,389
The structure expanded and crept and deformed
permanently.

1365
01:34:08,389 --> 01:34:12,460
Had we flown that vehicle, had we designed
a vehicle like that, what that would have

1366
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:19,320
done is would have allowed plasma to flow
through the shingles, if you will, and into

1367
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,260
the structure.

1368
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:23,530
And that's exactly what happened in Columbia.

1369
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:28,880
Letting the hot plasma gas get in the vehicle,
you cannot stand it.

1370
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,070
It's the details about that.

1371
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:33,290
We said we're not going to go with a metallic
design.

1372
01:34:33,290 --> 01:34:35,540
Plus, if you scratch it, it oxidizes.

1373
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:38,870
And, if it oxidizes, then it can fail.

1374
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:45,870
So we went with something that was just coming
online, and that was a fused silica material.

1375
01:34:46,969 --> 01:34:53,969
And fused silica is pure sand, pure silica
material.

1376
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:56,679
That's all in the world it is.

1377
01:34:56,679 --> 01:35:03,679
The process is you make it into a fibrous
structure, if you will.

1378
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:06,550
Fibrous material is a better term.

1379
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:10,500
A fibrous material that is mostly air.

1380
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:13,540
It is about the same density as balsa wood.

1381
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:20,540
It has an ultimate strength of about 12 psi,
tensile load is about all that it can take,

1382
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:24,969
but it has a thermal performance that is fantastic.

1383
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:31,969
As you will recall this chart here, when you
look at LI-1500, is what that was with aluminum,

1384
01:35:36,889 --> 01:35:42,330
and that's what we went with, we used this
same characterization to decide what the material

1385
01:35:42,330 --> 01:35:49,330
we were going to use was on the vehicle from
a weight standpoint and a cost standpoint.

1386
01:35:49,909 --> 01:35:56,909
The way the tiles work thermally like this
is the low strength brittle, almost like glassy

1387
01:36:01,239 --> 01:36:08,239
material, it's a ceramic, is coated with literally
a glass coating on the outside about 60-thousandths

1388
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,659
of an inch thick and it's black.

1389
01:36:12,659 --> 01:36:19,650
As the vehicle comes back in and dissipates
its energy through drag and heating, 90% of

1390
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:25,590
the heat is radiated away from the vehicle,
10% of it goes into the vehicle.

1391
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:32,119
But this is such a good thermal isolator,
a poor thermal conductor, by the time the

1392
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:39,119
heat gets to the vehicle, the vehicle is back
into an atmosphere where it's not heating

1393
01:36:39,889 --> 01:36:40,630
anymore.

1394
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:47,630
That dictated the thickness of these tiles,
of this silica material.

1395
01:36:47,739 --> 01:36:54,739
The vehicle has got almost 21,000 tiles on
it, and they vary anywhere from a half inch

1396
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:03,949
thick up to about three inches thick.

1397
01:37:03,949 --> 01:37:08,800
It's sculptured to stay within the mol line
because the aerodynamicist told us what it

1398
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:09,510
has to be.

1399
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:16,510
And so what we did was sculptured the TPS
so that we didn't have any more than we needed.

1400
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,420
Great job by all the thermal analysts.

1401
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:23,719
I mean they did this fantastic.

1402
01:37:23,719 --> 01:37:27,090
I want to mention, when that says 9 pound
or 22 pound tiles, that's not the weight of

1403
01:37:27,090 --> 01:37:29,550
each individual tile, that's the density per
cubic foot.

1404
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:29,800
Per cubic foot, correct.

1405
01:37:29,699 --> 01:37:29,949
Thank you, Jeff.

1406
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:33,239
What was the footnote about Columbia on that?

1407
01:37:33,239 --> 01:37:38,230
On the last chart, Tom, there is a footnote
about the difference in the Columbia.

1408
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:45,230
Let me come back to that in just one second.

1409
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:52,250
What I want to talk to you about right now,
this is something I had from some old material.

1410
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:54,050
I was just trying to get a characterization.

1411
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:58,909
What that said is on Columbia there was an
infrared sensor as an experiment.

1412
01:37:58,909 --> 01:38:02,949
So, the number of tiles varied on that vehicle
compared to all the other vehicles because

1413
01:38:02,949 --> 01:38:06,570
of this infrared thing at the top of the vertical
stabilizer.

1414
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:10,699
I should have cut that off.

1415
01:38:10,699 --> 01:38:11,650
You're reading too close.

1416
01:38:11,650 --> 01:38:18,650
[LAUGHTER] We thought let's figure out how
to take this fragile material and put it on

1417
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,219
this aluminum structure which has a high thermal
coefficient of expansion.

1418
01:38:26,219 --> 01:38:30,810
The tiles have almost a zero thermal coefficient
expansion.

1419
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:33,199
We said we've got to isolate that.

1420
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:39,030
We put a strain isolation pad [UNINTELLIGIBLE
PHRASE].

1421
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:44,659
Why do they vary in density?

1422
01:38:44,659 --> 01:38:45,600
Yeah.

1423
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:50,790
Because primarily for strength, for one of
the things.

1424
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:56,199
And the LI-2200 was a little bit higher temperature
capability.

1425
01:38:56,199 --> 01:39:00,730
And I don't remember [OVERLAPPING VOICES].

1426
01:39:00,730 --> 01:39:06,940
But it had a little higher peak temperature
capability.

1427
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:13,940
And that was dictated by what one of the failure
modes of a tile was if you exceed the temperature

1428
01:39:14,630 --> 01:39:15,960
too much it starts slumping.

1429
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:19,619
I don't want to say melting but it begins
to distort.

1430
01:39:19,619 --> 01:39:26,580
And a LI-2200 didn't distort to the same extent
that a LI-900 tile did.

1431
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:33,580
We said let's isolate the structure here from
this material up here which is required to

1432
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:42,119
keep from failing all these tiles, so we put
something between them.

1433
01:39:42,119 --> 01:39:47,679
It was just a very loosely woven felt material.

1434
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:53,230
Now we proved that the aluminum can expand
all it wants to, or within limits, we looked

1435
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:59,550
at it realistically, and that the tile was
OK, except the tile couldn't be too large

1436
01:39:59,550 --> 01:40:02,320
because of this relative expansion and contraction.

1437
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:05,719
So, that dictated the size of the tile.

1438
01:40:05,719 --> 01:40:08,570
We literally pre-cracked them, if you will.

1439
01:40:08,570 --> 01:40:12,139
We put expansion joints is another way of
looking at it.

1440
01:40:12,139 --> 01:40:17,889
A typical tile is 6 inches by 6 inches when
it gets into the highly heated area.

1441
01:40:17,889 --> 01:40:22,489
Now all of a sudden we've got some room for
the title to move relative to one another,

1442
01:40:22,489 --> 01:40:26,550
structure to move underneath it because of
the strain isolation pad.

1443
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:29,540
And we said, viola, we've got this problem
fixed.

1444
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:31,630
We're good to go..

1445
01:40:31,630 --> 01:40:38,630
We said we've got 25,000 of these tiles that
we now have to certify that they're good to

1446
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:51,540
go for the vehicle.

1447
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:53,920
There were gaps between the tiles?

1448
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:54,310
Correct.

1449
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:59,869
But, when you re-enter, do the tiles expand
so that there are no gaps?

1450
01:40:59,869 --> 01:41:00,260
No.

1451
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:06,909
What we do is make sure that the gap can just
close but not close such that you're loading

1452
01:41:06,909 --> 01:41:09,340
one tile relative to the other.

1453
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:10,560
That set the gap.

1454
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:16,989
And, if during manufacturing which is not
that precise, if the gap was too large we

1455
01:41:16,989 --> 01:41:18,679
just stuck a gap filler in.

1456
01:41:18,679 --> 01:41:20,420
Not the one that was on the last vehicle.

1457
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:21,429
It's a different kind of gap fill.

1458
01:41:21,429 --> 01:41:28,429
Just a piece of Nomex or SIP material strain
isolation pad coated with rubber or with RTV,

1459
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:32,989
and we stuck it in between the tile just to
reduce the flow if the gap was too large.

1460
01:41:32,989 --> 01:41:39,989
So there is no chance that you would have
hot plasma coming in between them?

1461
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,340
Yes, there is a chance you can have plasma
going through there if the gap is too large.

1462
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:44,750
We had a very specific requirement.

1463
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:48,530
I think it was like 90-thousandths of an inch
between tiles.

1464
01:41:48,530 --> 01:41:54,650
And if it were, say, 130-thousandths of an
inch, as installed because of tolerance buildup

1465
01:41:54,650 --> 01:42:00,350
and all that kind of stuff, then what we did
was stuck a plasma flow preclude, if you will,

1466
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:06,440
a gap filler between those to stop the plasma
flow from getting between the tiles.

1467
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:13,420
And we had some experience where we lost some
gap fillers, plasma flowed between the tiles,

1468
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:17,869
caused excessive heating on the tiles and
started causing them to slump and melt a little

1469
01:42:17,869 --> 01:42:22,530
bit, did a little bit of structural deformation
but nothing significant.

1470
01:42:22,530 --> 01:42:27,929
Losing gap filler was a turnaround issue,
not a safety of flight issue.

1471
01:42:27,929 --> 01:42:29,310
We made sure of that.

1472
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:29,670
Excellent question.

1473
01:42:29,670 --> 01:42:33,170
This is more of a general question, but I'm
wondering if since then anybody has done any

1474
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:37,199
work to find a material that could accomplish
both tasks, the structure and the thermal

1475
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:44,199
protection rather than having to deal with
these types of issues.

1476
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:51,380
That was back to one of my trades were we
said let's take that approach and see if we

1477
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:57,389
cannot design a vehicle that can take the
temperature and the loads, too, both.

1478
01:42:57,389 --> 01:42:59,130
There was no material that existed.

1479
01:42:59,130 --> 01:43:04,560
I don't think a material exists today that
I know of to be worked to a high enough stress

1480
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:08,619
that you can keep the weight down to have
those kinds of temperatures and to be worked

1481
01:43:08,619 --> 01:43:10,020
at a high temperature.

1482
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:17,020
I think on the X-33 design they were talking
once again of trying to make it out of a metallic

1483
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:18,710
structure.

1484
01:43:18,710 --> 01:43:21,469
Part of it was structure and part of it was
tons.

1485
01:43:21,469 --> 01:43:28,350
But we never got to the point of being able
to fly and test it.

1486
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:35,350
But they also were using a thermal isolation
system like tiles over part of the vehicle

1487
01:43:35,389 --> 01:43:36,500
on the X-33.

1488
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:43,500
The Buran, which was the Soviet copy of the
Shuttle, they were very anxious to get away

1489
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:53,369
from the expense of the tiles.

1490
01:43:53,369 --> 01:43:54,540
And they ended up with a thermal protection
system not very different than what you said.

1491
01:43:54,540 --> 01:43:55,350
You mean they had tiles?

1492
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:55,940
Yeah.

1493
01:43:55,940 --> 01:44:00,510
As a matter of fact, I remember they were
more like bigger blankets.

1494
01:44:00,510 --> 01:44:01,409
That's a good point, Larry.

1495
01:44:01,409 --> 01:44:03,480
I was about to skip over it.

1496
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:08,880
I said they were typically 6 inches where
they were really thick, but in other areas

1497
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:14,690
we made like 12 or 15 inch tiles that were
very thin.

1498
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:21,690
And the reason we could do that is we decided
if they crack it doesn't matter because the

1499
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:26,929
gap wouldn't be large enough for the plasma
flow to go through there and it would simply

1500
01:44:26,929 --> 01:44:27,869
be a self-relieving.

1501
01:44:27,869 --> 01:44:33,619
So, we tried to reduce the cost of manufacturing
by making some of these tiles larger.

1502
01:44:33,619 --> 01:44:35,670
And I will show you that in just a second.

1503
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:42,670
I'm going to skip forward here and show you
one thing..

1504
01:44:53,290 --> 01:44:57,960
That's 50-thousandths of an inch.

1505
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:04,960
The allowable for the tile was 12 psi.

1506
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:12,230
The ultimate stress was 12 psi.

1507
01:45:12,230 --> 01:45:14,610
The allowable stress was about 8 psi.

1508
01:45:14,610 --> 01:45:19,219
And that's with the total loads combined on
the tile.

1509
01:45:19,219 --> 01:45:25,360
What do you have to consider in one of these
25,000 tiles that you have to assure is not

1510
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:26,230
going to come off the vehicle?

1511
01:45:26,230 --> 01:45:32,570
Remember I said when we looked in the early
phase studies of the vehicle we were looking

1512
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:34,440
at wing loads and stuff like that?

1513
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:39,139
Then we got into how is the wing going to
carry the load into the fuselage to the spar

1514
01:45:39,139 --> 01:45:40,619
and what was our design trade on that?

1515
01:45:40,619 --> 01:45:45,630
Those were sort of macro and semi-macro systems
engineering studies.

1516
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:47,409
Now we're into a micro.

1517
01:45:47,409 --> 01:45:51,869
Now we've got this little critical part, 6
inches by 6 inches.

1518
01:45:51,869 --> 01:45:54,690
Lose any one of about 10,000 and you lose
the vehicle.

1519
01:45:54,690 --> 01:45:59,489
It's got an 8 psi allowable strength.

1520
01:45:59,489 --> 01:46:01,480
We said well, that's no big deal.

1521
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:04,239
What are all the environments on this thing?

1522
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:09,429
We started looking at pre-liftoff, liftoff,
ascent, et cetera.

1523
01:46:09,429 --> 01:46:12,770
There is always something called mismatch.

1524
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:18,219
When you take something that is not perfectly
smooth and you bond something to it and they

1525
01:46:18,219 --> 01:46:25,219
are not to the same flatness, if you will,
there is going to be a stress induced into

1526
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:26,219
both parts of those.

1527
01:46:26,219 --> 01:46:30,510
Well, the structure doesn't care about that
stress but this little 8 psi allowable tile

1528
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:30,790
does.

1529
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:37,790
It says we cannot exceed about 19-thousandths
of an inch under one of these tiles for this

1530
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:39,869
to happen.

1531
01:46:39,869 --> 01:46:43,010
There is ignition over pressure during ascent.

1532
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:47,320
There is acoustic and vibration and that kind
of stuff that has to be considered.

1533
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:53,480
On ascent there are gradients because of shock
moving across the tile.

1534
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:54,790
There is internal pressure.

1535
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:58,429
There is skin friction and drag on the tile,
so you've got to consider that.

1536
01:46:58,429 --> 01:47:02,889
You have to consider the dynamics, the inertial
loads induced in it.

1537
01:47:02,889 --> 01:47:06,710
And the out of plane deflection is now the
vehicle flying.

1538
01:47:06,710 --> 01:47:08,030
The structure is deforming.

1539
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:10,210
So, you've got to consider that.

1540
01:47:10,210 --> 01:47:15,650
Now you can see you've got 25,000 tiles with
all these combinations of load conditions

1541
01:47:15,650 --> 01:47:20,750
so how in the hell do you design that?

1542
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:22,480
This is the characterization of it.

1543
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:29,480
This is what happens with a structural deformation
of like 10-thousandths of an inch deflection

1544
01:47:33,590 --> 01:47:35,010
underneath a tile.

1545
01:47:35,010 --> 01:47:38,050
With that kind of formation it causes 1 psi.

1546
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:40,420
And it linear almost.

1547
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:44,670
So, 20-thousandths of an inch deflection is
going to cause 2 psi.

1548
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:50,260
Well, 2 psi is not a lot but it's a quarter
of your allowable.

1549
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:52,389
We said we've got to consider that.

1550
01:47:52,389 --> 01:47:57,880
We have to understand what is happening to
this structure as you fly it, a condition.

1551
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:03,170
This is a free body, if you will, of the pressure
distribution on a tile.

1552
01:48:03,170 --> 01:48:06,190
It has internal pressure within the tile.

1553
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:10,230
It has a pressure differential on the outside
of the tile because of a shockwave moving

1554
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:14,480
across it because of the pressure as it varies
around the vehicle.

1555
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:18,360
So, you have to consider all of that.

1556
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:25,360
We did all that and said we've got a problem,
because what happened was all of a sudden

1557
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:31,560
our allowable on our tile was decreased by
half.

1558
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:36,040
And this was not good.

1559
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:39,949
We screwed up, in the systems engineering
point of view, when we did this.

1560
01:48:39,949 --> 01:48:46,830
Remember we put the strain isolation pad underneath
the tile and we did all these other loads

1561
01:48:46,830 --> 01:48:47,520
on it?

1562
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:53,460
What we forgot, or what we didn't realize
was this strain isolation pad had little stiff

1563
01:48:53,460 --> 01:49:00,460
spots in it because of the way it was stitched
to keep the strain isolation pad together.

1564
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:05,570
And every stiff spot acted like a hard point.

1565
01:49:05,570 --> 01:49:10,429
Now, when you take a tile and you put external
loads on it and there is a stress concentration

1566
01:49:10,429 --> 01:49:14,989
on each one of those things, that stress concentration
had an amplification of two.

1567
01:49:14,989 --> 01:49:18,900
All of a sudden our allowable were decreased
by a factor of two.

1568
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:22,170
And we thought we have a major problem.

1569
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:26,760
This is when Aaron and I got to know one another
better than we ever wanted to.

1570
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,929
We met every day on this thing.

1571
01:49:28,929 --> 01:49:31,820
We had tiles bonded all over the vehicle.

1572
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:33,380
Necessity was the mother of invention.

1573
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:40,380
What we had to do was dissipate this stress
concentration.

1574
01:49:41,099 --> 01:49:45,820
We said we'll put a plate underneath it, a
graphite/epoxy plate or something like that.

1575
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:47,690
That would have added a lot of weight to the
vehicle.

1576
01:49:47,690 --> 01:49:54,690
Glen Ecord, a materials guy came up with the
idea in the lab one weekend, he took silica

1577
01:49:55,639 --> 01:50:00,840
powder in water and just painted it on the
bottom of the tile.

1578
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:06,369
What it did was fill all the pours in the
tile for about three-sixteenths of an inch.

1579
01:50:06,369 --> 01:50:11,690
And just compacted themselves in there.

1580
01:50:11,690 --> 01:50:18,690
And that was an inherent capability of a tile
with that powder packed in it, if you will,

1581
01:50:18,929 --> 01:50:20,360
that doubled the strength of the tile.

1582
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:24,380
What it did is it dissipated the load from
being concentrated into the tile.

1583
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:31,270
So, without any weight, some cost, we had
to pull some tiles off the vehicle and densify

1584
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:31,520
them.

1585
01:50:31,449 --> 01:50:33,710
Now all tiles are densified.

1586
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:38,780
I meant to bring one to show you today but
I didn't.

1587
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:41,929
Analytically, we went through 25,000 tiles.

1588
01:50:41,929 --> 01:50:46,280
Here was our factor of safety distribution
over the entire vehicle.

1589
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:53,280
We said we're good for that, but the thing
we don't know is if the tile is really bonded

1590
01:50:55,230 --> 01:50:57,860
on the vehicle like it should be.

1591
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:01,409
We said we can fix that problem.

1592
01:51:01,409 --> 01:51:02,250
We will verify it.

1593
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:09,250
We will pull on every tile and make sure that
it has a capability of the maximum expected

1594
01:51:09,710 --> 01:51:12,190
mechanical load that it is going to see.

1595
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:14,440
And so we pulled on every tile.

1596
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:20,270
And John Yardley, being an old stress guy,
says let me ask you a question.

1597
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:25,040
When you pull on every tile, how do you know
you haven't induced more damage and decreased

1598
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:29,639
the allowable of the title because of your
proof test?

1599
01:51:29,639 --> 01:51:30,119
Good question.

1600
01:51:30,119 --> 01:51:31,690
Easy answer.

1601
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:37,360
We'll put a microphone on every tile and we
will characterize the sound of the tile as

1602
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:43,440
we pull up on it, and we will get a sound
allowable, if you will, for proof-testing

1603
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:43,989
the tile.

1604
01:51:43,989 --> 01:51:46,739
We did that on every tile that had to be proof-tested.

1605
01:51:46,739 --> 01:51:53,290
We had an acoustic emission device, we had
a microphone on there, we characterized all

1606
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:56,760
these tiles and we did it.

1607
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:03,280
Another little mother's necessity of invention.

1608
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,380
And I'm not going to go through this.

1609
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:05,550
You'll get a handout of this.

1610
01:52:05,550 --> 01:52:10,219
What this did is said you cannot proof load
every tile, every tile is not densified, some

1611
01:52:10,219 --> 01:52:17,219
tiles are thick, some tiles are thin, but
prove under no uncertain conditions that you're

1612
01:52:19,330 --> 01:52:20,699
safe to fly.

1613
01:52:20,699 --> 01:52:24,099
We went through this logic on everything.

1614
01:52:24,099 --> 01:52:27,310
Some of these things had gates that said go
directly to fly.

1615
01:52:27,310 --> 01:52:28,780
Others we had to go through.

1616
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:34,449
Others we had to pull off the vehicle and
densify and proof load and do a bunch of other

1617
01:52:34,449 --> 01:52:37,909
things to prove that they were OK.

1618
01:52:37,909 --> 01:52:39,349
We got there.

1619
01:52:39,349 --> 01:52:41,080
Now we're into operations.

1620
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:42,580
We're just about out of time.

1621
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:43,080
I know.

1622
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:44,290
I've got three minutes left.

1623
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:45,639
Can I have all three?

1624
01:52:45,639 --> 01:52:45,889
OK.

1625
01:52:45,849 --> 01:52:49,889
Here is what we did.

1626
01:52:49,889 --> 01:52:53,800
We did some pretty innovative things on this
thing, and I think I've shown you some of

1627
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:54,260
that stuff.

1628
01:52:54,260 --> 01:52:58,290
But what were the surprises we had on the
first flight?

1629
01:52:58,290 --> 01:52:59,409
Not very many.

1630
01:52:59,409 --> 01:53:04,730
As we were going uphill, I told you about
the plume effect from the engines blocking

1631
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:09,650
the flow, that causes the pressure distribution
on the wing to be different than we designed

1632
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:09,900
for.

1633
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:13,050
The center pressure was further aft and outboard.

1634
01:53:13,050 --> 01:53:14,869
That loaded up the wing more.

1635
01:53:14,869 --> 01:53:19,639
It could not fly to the design conditions
that we needed to under worse case.

1636
01:53:19,639 --> 01:53:22,270
And I'll tell you what we did on that.

1637
01:53:22,270 --> 01:53:23,639
Well, let me just tell you right now.

1638
01:53:23,639 --> 01:53:30,639
What we did was almost day-of-launch wind
analysis, loads analysis for the wings with

1639
01:53:30,699 --> 01:53:36,199
load indicators in the wing to understand
what a specific flight regime was going to

1640
01:53:36,199 --> 01:53:37,310
do for that vehicle.

1641
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:42,500
And we literally designed the trajectories
for the first six or eight or ten shuttle

1642
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:47,980
flights so it stayed within a reduced capability
of the vehicle.

1643
01:53:47,980 --> 01:53:50,699
Because we characterized it so well, we could
do that.

1644
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:57,699
The other thing was the overpressure of the
vehicle, when the main engines let off there

1645
01:53:59,659 --> 01:54:02,440
was an accumulation of hydrogen gas underneath
the vehicle.

1646
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:09,440
And as soon as the engines fired it ignited
that hydrogen and sent a big shockwave up

1647
01:54:10,349 --> 01:54:10,800
the vehicle.

1648
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:16,909
It could have been pretty bad but it wasn't,
so we fixed that by isolating the isolation

1649
01:54:16,909 --> 01:54:19,610
and also burning it off prior to engine ignition.

1650
01:54:19,610 --> 01:54:25,060
And then we got some tile damage from external
tank.

1651
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:26,750
We fixed that.

1652
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:31,219
After about the second or third flight on
the external tank, we changed the foam process

1653
01:54:31,219 --> 01:54:33,590
and controlled that.

1654
01:54:33,590 --> 01:54:36,590
And so those were our only surprises.

1655
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:42,900
You remember the chart that I showed you of
all the combined environments on a tile?

1656
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:46,880
This is not politically correct what I'm going
to say, but I'm going to say it anyway.

1657
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:51,639
The shockwaves, the pressure, the out of plane
deformation, all that, you didn't see debris

1658
01:54:51,639 --> 01:54:54,679
anyplace on that chart.

1659
01:54:54,679 --> 01:54:58,780
Those tiles are not designed for debris, period.

1660
01:54:58,780 --> 01:54:59,929
You can rationalize it.

1661
01:54:59,929 --> 01:55:00,699
You can arm wave it.

1662
01:55:00,699 --> 01:55:02,570
You can statistically analyze it.

1663
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:06,090
The vehicle is not designed to fly in debris.

1664
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:10,599
It can take every other thing it's designed
for, but it cannot take what it's not designed

1665
01:55:10,599 --> 01:55:11,260
for.

1666
01:55:11,260 --> 01:55:12,909
The engineers today have two choices.

1667
01:55:12,909 --> 01:55:18,670
They can either eliminate the debris from
the external tank or, in my judgment, they

1668
01:55:18,670 --> 01:55:22,619
can go back and recertify the tiles for the
expected debris.

1669
01:55:22,619 --> 01:55:27,739
And that's probably not too big a deal, but
they cannot say we're ready to fly, going

1670
01:55:27,739 --> 01:55:32,010
through a logic matrix like I did, until they
do that.

1671
01:55:32,010 --> 01:55:35,010
OK, guys and gals.

1672
01:55:35,010 --> 01:55:36,929
Here are some challenges for you.

1673
01:55:36,929 --> 01:55:42,290
As you go through from the beginning of a
program, I would like you to be looking at

1674
01:55:42,290 --> 01:55:48,260
this crew exploration vehicle, what other
parameters would you look at other than what

1675
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:52,699
I've shown you here and what tools would you
use?

1676
01:55:52,699 --> 01:55:56,480
On the combined thermal mechanical, I think
a lot can be done on that.

1677
01:55:56,480 --> 01:56:00,480
I don't know what all the computing capability
is today, but I think that you could really

1678
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:07,480
simplify and probably decrease the weight
of the vehicle by doing that.

1679
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:10,520
Could they be made more rugged?

1680
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:11,580
Yeah, they probably could.

1681
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:14,050
But be careful.

1682
01:56:14,050 --> 01:56:18,560
This is a big systems engineering issue and
it's a political issue.

1683
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:22,449
And I'm going to get off the stage here in
one second.

1684
01:56:22,449 --> 01:56:29,449
Should there be a dedicated crew escape system
or should the reliability be built in the

1685
01:56:30,199 --> 01:56:31,110
vehicle?

1686
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:34,570
And I'll promise you that answer is not known.

1687
01:56:34,570 --> 01:56:39,150
It may be known from a political standpoint
that you have to have a crew escape system,

1688
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:40,790
and that's OK.

1689
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:45,730
If that's a requirement, that's a requirement,
but in a total system crew safety reliability

1690
01:56:45,730 --> 01:56:47,560
that's not obvious.

1691
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:52,980
It depends on what the design is and what
the reliability of the constituent elements

1692
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:54,780
are.

1693
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:56,360
How would you fix the ET?

1694
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:59,050
Put shrink wrap all over it.

1695
01:56:59,050 --> 01:57:05,440
Another thing that's not part of the curriculum
here is political systems engineering.

1696
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:09,869
You can have the best engineering design in
the world, but if you don't have the political

1697
01:57:09,869 --> 01:57:13,500
support in a program like this it doesn't
matter.

1698
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:19,469
How does political influence come into a systems
engineering thing, kind of like the crew escape

1699
01:57:19,469 --> 01:57:19,780
system?

1700
01:57:19,780 --> 01:57:20,080
Thank you.

1701
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:27,080
[APPLAUSE] Well, that was just super.

1702
01:57:34,150 --> 01:57:38,440
This is hopefully the first of many lectures
which will take us to a much greater depth

1703
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:39,700
[then when we did the shuttle system?].
